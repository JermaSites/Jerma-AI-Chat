What is your opinion on the new Star Wars game?
I can't believe Jerma is still on this level
This game is fun but it's not a good stream game
you don't have to be a mod, it's just that it's very hard to keep track of your progress, and it's really slow
do you get to the menu after a break
what if the whole stream is a vod
i just want to know how i got a sub
so when is the stream with joel starting
i would be so upset if someone gave me a sub
YOU NEED TO DO A BEGINNING ON THE PRIVATE
I mean, it was a fun time
I didn't even know they were called MEGAMANIES
you should have bought the boots jerma
I wish he'd play more Viva PiÃ±ata jermaPluto
I really like this game, I played it for like 2 years
You're too busy playing your video game
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not even sure what the game is
have you considered playing this game as a joke?
its so easy to kill it, just do the tutorial
i bet jerma can't even beat a childrens game
im going to play animal crossing right now
have you tried turning it off and on again
you should see a doctor about this
I'm gonna go watch Vinny play this please don't stop streaming
Just eat an egg. That's what you'll do
why are you in a fucking bathtub, what the fuck
you should play the original Nancy Drew
I don't think he knows how to use a keyboard
Please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
what if you accidentally left a sandwich in the kitchen?
I'm sorry Jerma, I didn't mean to say it
What if the streamer is just a clone of himself
i thought you said you were gonna play this for 5 hours
you are not a streamer anymore, you have been retired from Twitch.
its a hot dog flavored water and its great
do you know how many bits to donate?
theres a lot of good stuff in the game
I'm not sure you're ready for that one
there's a setting to turn on the sound effects
i want to watch this one with my friends
do you have any idea what the title is?
you can get the other ones for free
If you don't do it, you have to eat the shoe
the game's audio is making me want to die
i think you can just make a new account if you want
you could have just said "I'm gonna go eat dinner"
He can't even beat the final boss of the game
you can get the other boots for free
"I'm not going to do this" - Jerma
oh my god this is the best game ever made
You need to buy the boots from the shop
HEY JERMA, I SEE THE EVIL IN YOUR EYES
theres a lot of good games on youtube
theres a new one coming out called Black & White
You can also use the jetpack to fly
play the game how I want you to play :)
it's like a series of mini games or something
just add a 2nd line to the end of the video
You're not going to make it to the end
you gotta make the katamari out of toothpaste
you have to take your own life
if you want to play more terraria, play the new expansion pack
why is this streamer so excited for the game?
The voice acting in this game is so good
you can turn the music off and on again
I'm sorry I can't keep up with your streams
This game is fun but I can't wait for the next episode
you know what i do when i see jerma in the middle of the street
i just got here, what is this game
you can get the other boots for free
I'm glad you are having fun with this game :)
you're going to get a heart attack
@
====================
This game is just a big circle and you can't see it
you should get a chef hat so you can do your cooking
will you ever play the original Dead Space?
the only thing that matters is that you play as a bunch of animals
I'm not a virgin but I'll do it
if you turn on face cam, you look like you're in a different room
Can you do a little bit of the chat voice?
He was so proud of that right? Kappa
I'm sure this is going to be a good stream
I'm a Japanese girl, I like to be called Toto
did you know you're only allowed to play as a 2nd character in any of the games?
You're going to lose the game if you don't play
YOU HAVE TO BUY THE SAME LAND FOR THE OTHER TEAM
You should probably play the first one
this is just a bootleg zelda game LUL
Oh I thought this was a horror game
THEY'RE THE BEST! THEYRE THE BEST! <3
Jerma, can you do the voice acting for the characters?
why would you want to save the dog from a slaughter house?
HES TRYING TO KEEP HIS VIEWERS ALIVE
you have to use the other person
you can just pick it up and put it in the garbage disposal
I'm going to play this game while watching this stream.
You know it's a lie when you do it
he was a drunk baby when he was 6
He just wants to be a funny streamer
just get a real gun and run
I think you need to put the teleporter back
this is the most fast paced game I have ever seen
this is the most generic song I have ever heard
he's going to die in the next 10 minutes
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THIS STREAM
you just need to read the manga
theres a health bar at the bottom right
I can't wait for the stream to start with Jerma
the camera is on the top right
You could try to get a picture of yourself as a normal human
You have to use the other person
I'm glad we're here for the Jerma LUL
theres a health bar at the bottom right
that's the same streamer that said he was going to die in 7 minutes
I'll have you know that I'm a small man and I'm proud of that
you know what they say about big fish with big hands
Just make the bullet holes smaller, they'll go away
That's what happens when you play with mods
it's like 3 hours in and theres still no end of content
I'm gonna be a hero when I grow up :)
you can go into the other menu and press the two buttons at the same time
I wonder how many people were here before he started playing this game
we get it, you're a wizard :)
I'm going to go watch the VOD now
did you know that all jermas have a penis
theres a health bar at the bottom right
you should play the demo of this game
Why is the mod so mad about the weird old lady
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
why is he so into this game OMEGALUL
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I'M THE GIANT RAT THAT MAKES ALL OF DA RULES jermaChomp ðŸ“£
you're gonna have a real problem if you don't make it
you have to be high to do this
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
please do a 24 hour stream where you just make an omelette
you can just walk to the next area
You should play FEAR 1 and 2
This is the worst game I have ever seen
This is the best game of all time
i hope the new one is better than the old one
I've seen your channel before and it was your first time playing
do you have a currentity of the game?
they are just gonna do a 200mph run
jerma you've been playing this for like 2 hours
This is going to be
====================
you can only do one at a time
If you go through the door, you can find the 2nd floor room
you can do it with your friend if you want
did you ever figure out how to make it to the top of the tree?
I didn't get to eat, but I'll do it again later
you can hold shift to skip a cutscene
Would you ever consider playing Jump King again?
please do the first level of this game again
you have a good idea of what you're doing
Jerma what is the most obnoxious thing you can do to an audience?
what if the next week is the week where jerma goes on a rant about how much he hates streaming
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO JUST HIT HIM IN THE FUCKING HEAD
i think this game is the most expensive game ever
you need to get those boots to play on the beach
can you turn down the difficulty in the options
You need to make an account now
you guys don't even have the same name
I can't wait for the Jerma985 arc to start
did you know you can throw stuff
You can get the boots by clicking on the car
what if theres a door that says "I'm in the lobby"
We're here to support you through this tough time.
theres a new book coming out next week called "The Last of Us"
I like how chat is now filled with people talking about the right thing
I can't believe Jerma is a furry and doesn't know what a fox is
jerma I think you're just making fun of me
I'm not gonna lie this game looks pretty cool.
YOU CANT GET THE BOOTS IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 564. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
jerma is the only person to have a lego hair
this is the first time i've ever seen someone play this
YOU NEED TO DO THE LEASH JERMA
You don't have a dad to put food on
there is a vr version of this game
you can do it with your friend if you want

YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. I CANT BELEIVE YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY ON YOURSELF
You can get the boots by clicking on the car
you can do it with your friend if you want
you need to do the secret boss
LUL "I didn't know there was a sub sound!"
you know what they say about a good game being hard
you just have to play a little bit
you need to do the 5g gum joke
"What is this, a sewer system?" "It's a sewage system"
just play the whole game at once
Jerma, I'm sorry for calling you a loser. I don't understand.
You have to hold shift to skip a cutscene
just go to the sun and leave it running
i hate that you're playing this game and you're playing it right now
it's like the best thing you can do
you can do it with your friend if you want
what the fuck is going on in this game
Jerma is the type of guy who gets on the phone and calls his parents and says "I'm sorry dad"
you have to go through the door first
you can get the boots by clicking on the car door
you can do it with your friend if you want
How do you have a car in your house?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST MAKING FUN OF ME
you got it the first time dude, you can do it again
When is the stream where you play the game
Hey @Jerma985, I'm here to watch the best games on the Gamecube

jermaChomp SLEEPING FOR 3 HOURS JERMA WE LOVE YOU
the only way to beat this boss is to play as a girl
I'm going to make a Jerma985 reference, I'm going to say it's a Jerma985 reference
i love how people keep saying it's boring
this is the best stream of 2020 I can't believe it
Did you know that there's a secret boss in this game?
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
I think there's a full moon tonight
I'm going to be in a really bad mood
you need to use the cheat codes in the menu
You can have a potion that heals you
you just found out that your friend isn't streaming right now
I can't believe you did that to me
I think this is a bad one
you just gotta do a little bit of art
This is so sad can we get a â€œjermaWalkâ€

if you see this message you have to leave :)
theres a secret boss in this game @Jerma985
jerma's not even playing the game, he's just making up new words
I think it's because you didn't get the boots
they got the oscar nominated for best movie
try not to use the fire gun
it's a good idea to go to the store, not just the store
you can do it with the new character
you need to be careful with that
i'm gonna say it i'm going to say it
theres a secret boss in this game
"Glad I didn't see that one" - Jerma
you can get a new character by playing the game
please tell me you have a plan for the carnival stream
jerma you are the best gamer of all time
you can get a new character by playing the game
Hey jerma, this is my first time watching live, have you ever thought of streaming anything else?
I can't believe this streamer is finally playing a game
You should be playing this game instead of the game
You have to go to the town center, you can find chests and stuff in the town center
when is the carnival stream? i missed it
I remember when he was a cool boy FeelsBadMan
put your face over the left side of the screen
my friend just got a new job thanks
what's the best game to play on this stream?
You should probably do a more active playthrough of this game
I wish Jerma would play something like this jermaPluto
you can do it with the new character
if you say you are going to play it, youre making it look like a bad game
@Jerma
====================
Jerma is making a big mess because the audio is messed up
he needs to get to the end of the level
just do a tier list of your tier lists
you just got a bunch of tickets
I'm really happy that you're playing this, Jerma
how do you get a gun in this game
if you have to say a prayer to a god it means you're gonna die
hey jerma, i heard you were having a stroke and it's tearing your brain out
You can get the purple and red badges from the main menu
jerma i want to go to bed but i cant go to sleep
You're not paying for a game, you pay for a game
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -290. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i think he was really thinking about it
why do you look like a horror movie villain
you have to clean up the bodies to get rid of the bodies
play the shitty Mario Maker 2
I don't think you're going to get past the first level in this game
He's going to beat the game before the one thing that stops him
Jerma should be a new addition to the Jerma Rumble
he has to stop playing this game and play more Kenshi
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR OVER 8 YEARS
you need to get the coin from the last game
JERMA I'M GOING TO PEE I CANT WATCH IT WITHOUT YOU
just let it sit out for a bit
I don't think he can get to the next part without the coin
You need to start with the golden trophy
You should do a stream where you just just say "Yes" for the whole stream.
I wish I had a sub :( jermaPluto
Jerma, I just want to say that you're the best streamer on twitch
YOU CAN BUY THE PENAL CODE FOR THE BRIDGE
jerma please play as the rat the gorilla
you can hold the button to walk
You just had a chance to find some steak
jerma you can move the camera around to show your health
I didn't know you were such a gamer
jerma you need to move away from the mic
You can make them fight by having them move each other
if you die in the game you die in real life
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 I can't jup without a JUP jermaJup3 jermaJup4
you should probably look up the tutorial on the manual
you can do it but you have to change your name
YOU CAN BUY THE BRIDGE CODE FOR THE BRIDGE
It's the big rat from the rat movie
when you are about to die go to the next room
get the book to write down the story for a book
you should play an actual game instead
You should be able to do it on stream
theres a chapter 2, go watch it
hey guys i just got here, is this game called "Super Mario Bros"?
when are you going to play the wii game on stream?
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE TOP ROPE
you need to use the rainbow leash
You're not a real gamer if you don't have the PS4
i heard you can't beat a game
JERMA YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
if you want to buy a used copy, you better get it in bulk
You can actually sell the game to someone who has beaten it
you can make them fight by having them move each other
can we watch the DMCV game now?
I have to go to bed soon
if youre gonna play darkwood you better play it with a new player
this game has the most beautiful soundtrack
you can get the purple badge from the main menu
you just said the first two numbers in the numbers column
You can get the blue badge from the menu

LUL i cant believe he is still playing this
You can get the purple badge from the main menu
you can get
====================
 right now is a new game and he's still in the tutorial level
I want to eat a shoe but I'm not a doctor
You look like a bit of a weirdo
You can only get those 4 tickets in this game
i think you can use it for the next level
I think it's a thing that happens to me
you should go to the moon and take a photo of it
I am in love with the new Jerma985
its been like 3 months since the last stream
i just wanna see a picture of jerma
Jerma, you're going to need to leave now
If you just keep playing I'll donate 50 bucks
It's gonna be the only game I've ever seen
jerma you can literally get the same level twice
why are you wearing a banana peel over your head?
I'll have to watch this stream to understand what's going on
this is like a mmo where you have to create a giant city with your own characters
YOU DON'T NEED A BATHROOM IF YOU'RE IN A COMA
it's a sequel to the game
is this the streamer who lost to pinwheel?
you can just pick up and put in the fire
I'm getting nervous, I can't wait to see what this game is gonna be
you need to eat more to get the higher stats
i have no idea what's going on anymore
It's the face of a man who is being held captive
i think you can get those last 3 tickets in this game
"Honey, you know what you gotta do, put the money in the bag!"
do you know how to play the game?
I'm pretty sure that was the last time you played this game
You're getting into your pants, what's that smell?
why is this guy playing a game with a girl
that was the last time you did that
i feel like he's been in that room for like 20 minutes
i think you can get the coin from the girl you just met
what did you think of the new Halo update?
You're not even supposed to play it, you're playing the DLC.
You can also break his legs, which makes his legs useless
jerma can you please get a haircut? my dog is crying
i'm not a fan of the new jerma but atleast i can make my own game
can you do a backflip for the meme
The mods are using it to tell them to stop.
i'm gonna be honest, this is pretty much a childrens game
if you can read that, you can do it
You have to get it to 100% before the game even starts
jerma you gotta get the ball, then slide it
i cant believe jerma is a fucking psycho
This is like when you try to play with your grandma
Theres a good one at the end of the game
If you want to play a game for a few hours, you can always look at the community content channel.
you can do it i think you can
It's like a video game with a bunch of flashing lights
do you have the green screen movie night coming up?
This is the first time you've ever played this game
jerma you have to go back to the start of the game
You can get those tickets in this game
your boomer brace is too small for you
put a game in the corner of the screen and pretend it's a game
It's a shame there's only like 10 people here right now
it's not like you need to be an actor to do that
you should probably play a better game
i dont think you can get that coin
You can get the coin from the girl
this is a really good stream LUL its so good
you have to do it every 5 seconds
You can't get the coin, you can't get the coin
Would you ever play the TF2 expansions?
you just got a gun from the barrel of a gun
he was a kid and didn't know that
I'm so glad you got a sub! <3
is this the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?
if you get the coin it unlocks a new character
what do you mean "I'm not even joking"
i just got here why is he
====================
 is gonna be a lot of fun
I'm so excited for the carnival stream so I can go back to watching Jerma play some shitty games
I mean, you can always just watch the vod
can you play the games for me
go to the tavern and buy some potion
you can go to the museum for new characters
the more you drink the more money you have
They're talking about how you should go back to the town
did he just say he was gonna go to the store?
why are you wearing a banana hat
you can change it to the same row
You can change the font in the options
oh god oh fuck he can't hear us
He's not even halfway through the game, chat
you can also go to the tavern and buy some potion
if you kill the one on the right you can get another
if you do the tutorial in 2 minutes you're officially a noob
you can use it for a book of jerma's stories
you can get a new set of teeth by looking at the new set of teeth
There's a hole in the wall in the basement
I'm glad I caught the stream, I'll miss it
you can do it by clicking the little circle in the top left
this is what happens when you don't have a nice enough bedtime
I can't believe Jerma's gonna get a VROOMER
why are you guys in such a hurry to make a "cool" game
theres a cave there it goes to when you die
This is a pretty good game, but I can't play it
i know it's a lot, but youre making me hungry
I'm playing Terraria right now and this is what i come back to
I'm going to throw this on the fucking trashcan, but don't tell him
I'm so glad you're back to playing this game jermaHeart
I was hoping for a stream today, I can't wait
I'm still waiting for the Sam and Max stream
"you should play the actual game, i think it's fun"
you have to kill the demon first
You know what is funnier than a Jerma stream?
play the game, it's not the movie
I can't believe Jerma's streaming right now jermaPluto
I think you need to hold the stick to move the chainsaw
I'm actually mad that I didn't catch the last stream
this is the worst game ive ever seen
you're going to get 5 hours of sleep
You're a cool guy but you're a dumbass
You are looking at the wrong way
I'm going to tell my dad you have a penis
the problem is that there are still some people who dont know what they're doing
that's how they used to do it @Jerma985
Can you play this for the rest of the stream?
"Do you know what a JPEG is?"
how does this game have so many secrets
you can get a really good ring at the inn
I wish I could see my favorite streamer jermaPluto
Can you please play The Crystal Chronicles
i've been to the zoo in Nevada and you got me
why are you playing a mobile game, Jerma?
I hope he doesn't get to play in the snow again
jerma is not going to be a dad :(
you need to try the other one
you need to go to the tavern and buy some potion
I'm not sure what I'm even trying to accomplish here
You just beat dark souls on stream
jerma you can't even beat a child's game
you have to kill the monster first
I can't believe he's just gonna die in his sleep
you have to take a picture of the top of the head
you dont have to do anything with it
imagine not being able to see the screen because of the brightness slider
You got rid of the old bit donation button
the only way to get the secret is to do a secret combo on the screen
you can do the thing where you just take a picture of the top of your head
I am going to scream in my sleep
You can do the one where you just take a picture of the top of your head
I don't think that
====================
??? PogChamp

You're going to die of coronavirus within the next few days

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
You can use it to save your items
I don't think we're gonna get to that part of the game
Why is it so hot in this game?
do the cat song again please it's the only good one
hey jerma, just got here, what's your favorite food
Can't wait for the end of the game
I feel like this is the best game ever made
if you ever play the original Dead Space, that game is for kids only
I've never seen a single frame of that
we need to have a stream where we all cheer
Why is he playing this game on his phone?
the game was so fucking good, he didnt even know what it was
this is the only time i've ever seen jerma play this game
there is a shortcut to the left of the door
Jerma, you need to watch the VOD to see what happens
why is there a carnival in this game
i'm not sure what is going on anymore
if i see a rat i will shoot it
i got my hat in time for the coronavirus
Why does this game look like it was made for a 13 year old
can you play this game again, its been like 10 years
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
The camera is super useful when you need to be moving
do you know what a vroomer is?

i'm trying to get a job but i can't find a job, but i'm willing to bet you won't make it jermaPluto
YOU CAN WALK ON LAND WITTH THESE LEGS https://imgur.com/2aJHPR
I don't even know what the fuck this is
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
i dont remember that one episode in the movie
i like the song that plays when he gets the sword
I think you need to get to the end
he's just being a little bit of a daddy
Jerma you should play a different game
YOU CAN WALK ON LAND WITTH THESE LEGS @Jerma985
what is this streamer going on about? jermaDisgust
We're gonna need a community survey to decide if you're the real jerma
Make sure you get all the boots
I'll get a new sub for the stream
You have to do it again and save
can you do a backflip into the air?
I hate when jerma says something funny and then forgets about it
I'm going to come get a burger, I want a backflip
You need to get to the top, you need to get to the top
I'm not really that into anime, but I like a lot of the stuff they have
Jerma you can't do it you can't stop
It's a lie, the REAL Jerma is in the closet
I don't know if
====================
:(
Make it so it is always the same
i need to get some food soon jermaPluto
Why is chat so slow, why is he so fucking slow
Did you see the guy who said you have to go back to the beginning?
guys I think jerma is lying to us :(
did you know that a cockroach has a human breast?
you can make your own character in this game
you can make your own character in this game
it's funny because it's a game where you play as a soldier and you're just a kid
Did you see that tweet about the vroomer?
how do you not know what a harry potter hat looks like
did he just say he's not gonna stream today?
I can't believe Jerma is gonna be late :(
I have to go to work in an hour, can you pause the stream for like 15 minutes?
oh god, i'm gonna have to go to work in like an hour
you can't have more than two people in a room
this is the most elaborate joke you have ever done
you're not a gamer, you're a boomer
I'm going to fucking eat a bowl of these
You can make your own character in this game, the AI is kinda like a child
I'm so glad Jerma is finally playing Jump King. I'm so happy he's playing it.
this is your job and you are doing it wrong
i've been to the zoo once, and it was just a different animal exhibit
you are so dumb, it would be funnier if you were playing a child game
jerma is going to be a streamer in 30 years
you are not a real gamer, you are a meme gamer
i hate when i feel like im in a fever dream
It's a bit early for me, but I'm so glad I'm here for the stream
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 110. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
guys, i'm gonna play some games, play some games :)
I dont want to be in the kitchen again jermaPluto
this is what happens when you have a bunch of friends over a long-term relationship
why does the audio sound like its from the game
i wish i could just make my own jerma face
That's a good question, I'm sure it will answer
i was just about to say something about you
just play something else, just this is what you get
I had a dream where Jerma was in my room and I was like "Jeez, this guy is weird"
what is going on in this stream i just got here
i'm glad i didn't miss anything, it was a good stream
jermaOld I remember when I used to be cool jermaOld
I'm gonna miss the stream because I'm too lazy to download the archive
How many times has Jerma done this joke?
You can tell when Jerma is feeling down when he's trying to make a joke
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks he's a genius
I got the same feeling, but I'm having a lot of fun
jermaWalk MOO CROO jermaWalk POGS PogChamp MOO CROO PogChamp
just play the game and do a 24 hour stream
hey man, how about a relaxing relaxing stream?
Jerma you need to stop doing that please
if i had a dollar for every time someone said pee pee poo poo i would give it to my dad
I think this is going to be a shitty joke stream
that was the best thing you've ever done
I'm trying to get my switch back but it's too much work
this is like a fever dream stream LUL
this is the first time ive ever seen someone do this
is this the guy who beat sekiro on stream?
DONT DO IT JERMA YOU NEED TO DO IT
You can make your own character in this game
it's not the best game but it's not bad
can we just talk about the actual game now
hey jerma can you play the game already?
when I was a kid we had a lot of "movies" that were in theaters that were basically like japanese movies
i feel like im in the middle of the universe
its the guy from the intro to the video game
you can find the next level of the game in the game files
can you give a shoutout to my favorite streamer, JERMA985
If you
====================
I don't know what's going on but I'm pretty sure it's a vampire
I'm going to eat a fucking shoe you fucking boomer
jermaOld i've got a big ol' toothbrush, remember
you can get a lot of money from doing that
This is my first time here and I'm so disappointed in myself
you don't know anything about this game
He has like 7 teeth, you need to find them
I've got a turkey and a salad for dinner
you need to get your shit checked out
this is gonna be a good stream LUL
that's how you know you're a serial killer
he's gonna become the real villain in this game
I'm here to take your boogers away :)
Do you think you'll play all the games at some point?
hey can you turn up the music
You can't find any other monsters on this level
I'm gonna be honest, I don't know what this is
Dude, this game is amazing, but the music is shit
jermaWalk THATS THE POINT OF THE GAME jermaWalk
I thought you said you'd play all the games but I'm confused
it's just the same thing as in the first
if you lose this, i'm unsubbing :)
jerma has a full anime face on his face
I'm gonna tell my boss to fuck off.
I think this is a good game for the Switch
You need to hit the brakes on the bike
you should play the new star wars game
Make a whole game where you play as a spider
you need to use the special arrows
just do the one you like best
Can you just give us the other songs please
"I'm gonna get all of your bits"
you should get a dog to give you money
oh my god he's gonna get it
That's not a mushroom, that's a spider
You need to get the other half of the first column
jerma just like in the 90s, he was a slot machine
its not even a game its just a game
if you want to beat the game try it out
Jerma you can press alt+f4 to speed up the game
i hate it but i love it :)
why are you dressed like a young Bill Clinton
Hey jerma! did you know that the original Star Trek was a show in the public domain?
I can't believe Jerma is finally playing a game
you guys are just giving him a break
oh god he's not going to get the boots
HE HATES US HE WONT TAKE IT BACK jermaPluto
i think you are a big one guys
do you know what a youtuber is? @Jerma985
I want to see jerma play this game
i cant wait for the simpsons game :)
oh my god the jerma face is so good
you're not supposed to be playing this game
if you do a 985 on the clock you die
this is just a video game, you can't even beat this game
theres an easy mode you can get in the game
this is so weird that i love it
If you don't show Otto I'm going to call the police
this is gonna be a good joke
You can put your own items in the slots
he's the best character in the game Kappa
I'm just here to watch the stream and not make fun of chat
you're making me laugh my ass off
theres a lot of difference between the two
It was a fake carnival, but the fake carnival was you and a robot who gave you a gamecube controller
It's a very good game, but it's not very good
I wish I could get out of this game
I can't believe Jerma has a degree in Psychology
i'm glad you're playing this game, its just so fun to watch
"You can't solve this problem, I'm a professional computer scientist"
Jerma, you need to stop being mad at the game
what are the chances that you'll play another game this month?
why are you so bad at this
Jerma, I'm making a pasta that's the same size as my titties and it's just filling it up with milk
====================
your audio is awful and I hate it
jerma just go back to the russian death pit
jerma theres a big ass boss and hes not gonna finish this game is he?
I love the name of this game. It's so good
oh my god that thing looks like a katamari
are you going to play The Prototype 2?
I just got here and I'm already confused
you have to do the luigi's mansion music
I think the game wants you to do the voice
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
you can get a 10k gold badge for that
I remember playing this game as a kid, and I loved it so much
my dad says you look like a manlet
but i have to get my lunch and then leave
you can do it with the game now
I'll give you a $5 tip if you play the Cooking Simulator OST
i just got here and i'm already confused
I think you can find the original ending in the main menu
He's got some weird fetish for it
YOU COULD HAVE WENT TO THE SLEEPY MOUNTAIN ANYWAY
This is a bad idea, I'm going to watch a VOD.
I'm actually going to buy this game if you play it
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
will you play the DLC for the game
you need to buy more subs for it to work
YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE SHORTCUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
I can't believe you'd do this to me
its not a command, its a description
why are you not playing this game
you can't play this game in 2019 tho
jermaHeart you're the best streamer i've ever seen
I'm not sure what you meant by "two at the same time"
I think you just have to keep pressing the button
we're not friends anymore, you're a murderer
I'm not gonna lie, this game is very bad
just say it was a lie and you're fine
the reason you can hear him say that is because his brain is so small
i'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
You can find the DLC for this game in the main menu.
you cant do it until the last mission
this is what happens when you dont play good
you don't have to turn it down
jerma stop using the fire and get the boots
i just got here and i have no idea whats going on
can you tell us your favorite chocolate factory?
what if you die in the game?
I don't know how to use my finger to play the game
you can't even keep up with the lore
its a fucking party game you should play that
you need to get the boots first
what is the best way to make money?
Hey chat, I'm really drunk and wanna drink some wine.
you're gonna die in like 2 hours
you can get a sub badge for that
I'd like to play this game again
are you gonna play some of the other ones?
he's going to stream the final boss tonight
you'll be in the next jerma rumble LUL
youre going to have to do the whole day
I love that they're actually doing a hotline miami
I had the same thing but it was different
Jerma985 is a very good streamer, I love it
This is the most complex level in the game
He has no idea what to do with his brain
You have to get the boots first
you can only go to the last city
this game is really good I'm gonna stick around for more
You are making your character look like an old man
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE POOL FOR THE KEYBOARD
If you run past a building it's a secret
use the fire miracle on the wall
he's so bad at this game its impressive
LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD @Jerma985
why are you trying to get away from the fact that you're blind?
If you run past the building it's a secret
I am the giant rat that makes all of
====================
you just have to use the right trigger to make a right click on the list
so when is the carnival stream i want to watch it
Jerma, do you ever think you'll ever play a game like this again?
"You're not going to the zoo" - jerma
You can sell it to the store for 15 bucks
you can move it in the menu
you can turn off the generator in the game menu
you should play the first one, its better
you can make it in the menu
imagine being an actual jerma fan and watching a guy die in the movie theater
YOU DONT HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING EVERY TIME
You gotta make it so he can get the book
the game is so much better without the boots
You could just play the video game and not play it
I'm a vegan and I'm here to help
I've been here for 4 hours and he's still not done
how did you not notice the holes in the floor
you are not streaming tonight you have been acting weird for an hour
I think you can turn your lights off in the settings
I'm in college and I've seen a lot of vroomers.
you can use the menu to get the items
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.
i have to do it all over again
i want to know how many times jerma has died
you should try to make a house for your family
it was too much, they got to the bottom
it was that one guy who was trying to play a game of connect the dots
I know you're not going to do a full playthrough, but it's a great game to check out.
I can't believe you have to play this again
you can turn it off in the options
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY IT YOU WONT GET IT
you could just play the game and not play it
Just play the game now, it's a good one
this is the greatest game of all time
you can make it in the menu
this is the best game in the world
you can have a kid to help you out
I can't believe jerma is still playing this game
did you just take a bath and then put it back in the pool
i would just like to say you're a god at this game
You're going to forget about the sultan and end up murdering everyone you meet
the people that made this game made a better game than this
your mic has a built in mic
I thought you were going to say you were gonna be a political scientist
Have you heard of the one guy who said you should play Fistful of Frags?
you cant tell me what to do :)
i was gonna say "hey guys" but i forgot what
he didnt know what a link was LUL
You need to play a different game or we're all going to fucking die
get the boots to get the whole game
I'm just here to watch the Jerma985 stream, and chat is just a bunch of rats
you can turn it off in the options
What's the deal with the mic? It's supposed to be like a low note
i remember when jerma played gta online jermaPluto
its going to be so good and i will be so mad
you can move it in the menu in the menu bar
What if we all just sit and wait for the stream to start and we're all Jermas?
I just want to make sure that my dad doesn't get me in trouble again jermaPluto
I'm sorry, Jerma, but you need to get the boots.
why does he have so many viewers D:
im on mobile and im always confused as to what game youre talking about
you need to have a lot of health
i feel like this is the best thing to happen to this game
The bottom of the screen is filled with shit
It's not a secret, it's an order
I just got here and youre still playing this

====================
jermaWalk on my way to get some crack jermaWalk
I'm going to start a cult and make my followers believe in me
he doesn't want to be a dentist jermaPluto
I think you just had to turn the cam off
The noise you make when the camera is too close to the mic is so soothing
you can only do it once, you need to do it again
what if you had to be a teacher?
It's a little hard to tell which is which, but it's a bit obvious
jermaSour when your shirt smells like piss jermaSour
i'm gonna go to bed and see if i'll miss anything
i want a jerma themed roblox so bad
he should play a game like this that is good
play the part where you go into the bathroom
why do you have such a big ole cock?
I can't believe I'm watching this stream NotLikeThis
he was going to be in the rumble
You should have just told the guards you were here
the roman army has a 1 in history
you missed one of the secrets of the game
this is the kind of game that will drive you to the edge of your seat
you can put a small jump kick in there
i cant believe he died to pinwheel jermaPluto
do you eat the seeds on your head
You have to beat the game before you can make the slime
jermaWalk walkin' straight into the chocolate factory jermaWalk
The stream is over, you can stop now
i dont even know what im looking at
you're not even supposed to press the buttons on the keyboard
i want jerma to play the wii sports game

i wanna go to sleep to sleep, its already been 4 days since you left the house
you're gonna go into the toilet, and then you're gonna go out the window, it's gonna be a fucking mess
you look like a german wrestler you know
you can buy a new costume if you go to the shop
Do a stream where you play a game for a week
Jerma you should stream the new show The Office, it's an amazing movie and you should watch it :)
theres a mod that fixes it, it's on steam right now
Just play a game and be done with it
your last video was a bit longer than the one you just made
they're going to run you over and kill you
Can you stop pretending to be bad? NotLikeThis
He's never played a game before. He's never played a video game before.
you know what they say about big girls
the worst thing you can do is not play it, play it
you can literally do it in the infinite room
you are the streamer that died to pinwheel
it's a good thing they have a clown car
you should make a minecraft server for people to host their own
you can buy new costumes for the shop
oh my god this is so fucking cool
is this the new The Dark Knight Rises?
you can use the cheat menu on the main menu
I hope you can get all the keys

they're not that bad, but it's very easy to overdo it
is that a face in the bottom right
you can make your own pizza with that
I'm gonna be really sad when you die to pinwheel
You have to get the red items
you can't just shoot the guy that runs out of time to get the red items
have you seen the new Jump King DLC yet?
If you die to pinwheel you die to Pinwheel
did anyone see that video of the guy eating a hotdog and then puking it?
You should play this game with the boots
I think this is the best game ever made
YOU CAN FIND THE KEYBOARD IN THE VENT
you could
====================
what if we all just got a little drunk and didn't know
i can't believe jerma is actually a german and only plays german games
i've never heard a slur in my life
jerma you can't be a millionaire if you don't have a bitcoin miner
YOU CAN'T HAVE A POOP EATING STREAM jermaSun
I'm gonna play this game for the next week, that's a lot of fun
Jerma is the best streamer on the planet
you guys need to stop talking and go to bed
I think you can't have a business plan and have an easy time getting things done
I'm not sure what to do with my life now
The level design in this game is pretty good
I can't believe Jerma is going to die
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I'm sorry, I can't believe you were crushed by the jellyfish
guys im eating a burger right now
I remember when you said you wouldn't do it
you gotta make the poop joke a meme
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's fun
What's the hardest level in the game
you're not going to get it, just get it
What the fuck is this bullshit, I'm getting an ad for this game
you know the one thing you can't do with your life?
its a classic but you can change it to something else
can we get a jup storm? jermaJup1 jermaJup2
I think you need to equip the bow
can we get a fuckface emote for this?
You need to be in the right mood
he's gonna be doing the same thing for the rest of the stream
theres a whole story mode, you can play as the main character
you are a gamer, you should play this
im gonna put on my glasses and turn off the stream
hey jerma you know i have something special for you to stream, right
i'm on my last tab and i'm so glad it's not you
you can start a new game with the ability to time your jumps
you should be able to read chat, it's a lot of fun to watch, keep it up
You're gonna get this game stuck in your head for years
jermaPluto he's going to stream more like DIABLO jermaPluto
Just got here, what the fuck is happening
jerma i have to go to work soon can you pause the stream
If you do it again, I'll take it
if you have a cough, you need to get it checked by your doctor
if you try to go fast enough you'll run into enemies and die
What if you just gave the green light
this isnt the game you are supposed to play, this is a platformer
DONT WORRY GUYS YOU WILL BE THE ONE THAT LOST
if you put it in the right mood you can start it off with a chill stream
You're gonna get me, I'm ready

you can see the combat in this game
i would make a super bowl and have my own
is this the streamer that lost to the secret boss

I'm trying to make this as loud as possible
I think we're all gonna be dead in 30 years
you know you can make a worse version of a worse version of a
you can make it work with anything on the internet
i have a math test tomorrow :)
you can just do the whole game and not worry about spoilers
Why are you doing this to us?
this is the most realistic thing you've ever done
you can't just make it an anime game
is this a new sub sound? LUL
you need to get the right sort of item
you have to make it clear what you want
if you play for 12 hours the game won't stop for the rest of it
you can get the special pinball game for $40
This is the equivalent of jerma going insane over a cup of coffee
I think I saw this guy in a movie once
you know its ok to play the game as long as you dont get a virus
Can you explain the joke
====================
I'm so glad I got to see this.
you know how much they cost to buy a new mod
It's a lot easier to just make it smaller, and have a bigger diameter
you need to be at least a tier 3 sub
theyre just gonna be the top 3 tbh
they are also going to be the first to have the coronavirus
jerma is this a challenge to your skill?
you have to go to the fire
what if you just pick up the items and leave
Can you play a game please :)
This is like a game Iâ€™d play as a kid
You are being a dick to the people
do you still have the original mr bean?
YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR HALF YEARS JERMA
I can't believe Jerma's streaming career is over
you can get like 8000 dollars for that
Jerma is now the richest man in the world
this is like a really good song LUL
why are you playing this game, this is the best game
You gotta do the DMC5 level in this game
You can play as the giant rat
the fucking chad walkthrough you're making is so good
you know you can get a $50 if you have the right one
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 I am the guardian of sus! I thank you for casting sus!
I remember when I was a 5 year old
you need to go to the sewer
I'll be honest, I'm not sure. I've seen enough of this game, but I'm not sure
you need to make your own character
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
This is like a game where you are the only one who gets the game
you can skip the part where you get a better sword
It's just a joke, but it's a meme
i love that you can only get to the sewers at this point
you have to grab the pistol and shoot the gun
"Did I ever tell you about my secret bath of slime"
I'm actually a little concerned that Jerma is gonna be late
"I'm gonna run a marathon, and I'm gonna be so happy"
jermaPluto jermaJex2 this is a sad emote I can't take it anymore
just wait for the hot air balloon to come
will you be playing more mario maker 2?
don't forget to go to the sewer
THE SHADOW IS IN THE BASE @Jerma985
hey jerma i think you got the wrong door
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT
the game has a soundboard that plays the game sound
I can't believe Jerma died to Pinwheel jermaPluto
this is the equivalent of being a teenager in the 70s
when you get a better weapon you can use the shield
are you going to play the new smash DLC?
I think you're supposed to keep your guns up
is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
I feel like this game is getting more and more boring
this is like the last level in dark souls
you are the streamer who died to Pinwheel
get the glueman shirt for the new years stream
the game is just about to come out
if youre not ready for a cooking stream right now, youre not ready for a real cooking stream
You're supposed to do the same thing every time
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure
is this the guy who died to Pinwheel on stream?
put a gun in your mouth and shoot the mag
You can find the game on the website
YOU NEED TO BE IN A HIGHWAY
you have to jump on the treadmill
Hey jerma, I'm a fan of your streams and this is really cool
you can make a stealth meter at the top of the screen
are you gonna play the new fallout 76 update?
you just played the game wrong and you're making it up
Please fix the audio in the background
you are doing a great job at keeping them alive
Would you ever play the game HOMER?
hey guys just got here. what's going
====================
just got here what the fuck is this game
jerma is going to stream and he wont be able to beat it
I'm gonna do a double take, I'm going to beat the shit out of my wife
What is this game? Is it a parody of the Heavy Metal band
you could get a free copy of the game and play it on stream with no ads
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
you dont have to do it every time
you're really good at this game, it's just that the controls are so fucking stupid
You can sell the ring to your pawn for a very high price
you dont need to do it every time
I can't wait for the "You know what, I'm not going to eat that thing" joke
You can do a bit of everything and it's super fun
do you ever see your old friends on the internet?
you can't even read the names on the screen
you need to stop talking, i'm trying to watch the movie
is this the new video game ResidentSleeper
I just got back from eating and you're still streaming
it was made by a dude named Ster
its not really a very good game
i am so excited for the seaman stream
You can go to the tavern to sell weapons and sell tavern items
The music in this game is so good
I wish there was a way to make it less frequent, like you can't just stop streaming for an hour
Would you ever consider playing risk of rain 2?
your character looks like he's about to fall off
you can do a better on camera dunko
I just got here, what is he playing?
you know how to use the hammer
I can't believe this game is just a shitty version of that game that came out on the Switch
I've been gone for like 2 hours, what happened to the stream?
We're going to have a lot of fun
I just got here, why are we still playing this
why is your stream so slow compared to other streamers
go to the bathroom and pee in the bathtub
What is the meaning of life?
if you don't do it right now you have to do it again
that was a terrible joke, you should stop
put the facecam on for the rest of the stream
hey you have a donger. He's going to steal your shit
just wait until you see the light
you can't do anything with the new character, you'll just kill him

you know theres a lot of good games on steam right?
i can't wait for the first one to come out
I'm a 5 year old and this is my favorite game
just look at the bottom of the screen
we're just getting started with the game
is this the new Nancy Drew game?
Why is your character making this sound? @Jerma985
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I can't believe Jerma is going to kill Santa
it's the guy from the carnival stream who died to pinwheel
You're making it harder for the FBI to find you
i want to see him play minecraft again
You can buy the ring in the shop for a very high price
theres a whole new version of this game that's free on steam
this game has so much more content than the last game
theres like 5 different kinds of drugs in this game
you can sell the ring to your pawn for a very high price
you can get the ring from the shop by the way
If you don't get the ring you get a free item
You can use the axe on the wall, it's useful for when you run into walls
He was a crack head before he became a crack head now he's a crack head

TheIlluminati
I think the stream is starting soon, just got here
You should play with people of your same age, like 10+
I wanna see you play the ultimate katamari
you can sell the items you made for those
I can't believe Jerma is a furry LUL
that's why you have to go to the bathroom
if you do a vr game with this
i want a real game, not a fake one
i dont remember this game being this good
you have to put it in the microwave
I'll be honest I didn't know that
It's a good idea to be a little late
Is that the guy from the bongos? PogChamp
you can play "Anorakoda" in the game
So this is what you get for not streaming
I'm a new viewer and this game is so fucking good
you know you can just throw it up
This is literally just a survival horror game
what happened to the fish in the family?
I wish I could laugh at this game anymore
I'm getting a lot of nostalgia from this game
jerma you are so good at this game
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who has played this game
you have to find the exit to the arcade, it's a hidden area
I'm gonna watch this streamer do his taxes
JERMA THE GAME IS TOO LONG FOR YOU
HES JUST GOING TO TALK TO HIMSELF AGAIN
I'm still mad that you didn't stream yesterday
It's a lot of fun to play with friends
There's a ton of cool stuff in this game.
the camera is on the guy on the right
jerma this is a really cool game
you have to do the right thing
this game has a really good soundtrack LUL
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
you need to do it to the guy
it's not a human in the game
you have to find the exit to the arcade
The game is basically a fake game. It's a real game
why do you have a gun in your pocket
you should have made a tier list of things you would like to see in the future
I would be a little scared if this game were real
You can use the shield to block attacks
why is the music so bad for the first time
how do you feel about the dog being taken from you?
you can use your money to buy a new headset
what are you doing with your life
you can have them kill each other with the same attack
you can have them call each other "forsen"
What if I'm the only one who loves you?
please go to the kitchen and bring some food
when you're fighting the final boss, do you have a timer?
you should do a cooking stream with the cooking stream
I thought he was going to say this was a good game
is this the game where you play as a hobbit?
this guy doesnt know how to use the shield
what did you think of the new video?
he is gonna get addicted to the game
That was a very well written message, I would be very upset if he read it
the ones you can see in the menu are for people to see
Why are you dressed like a meatlovers?
you were supposed to shoot the guy with a gun
what the fuck is wrong with this guy
you should play both games at the same time
I have a feeling this is gonna be a good stream
jermaSun i want to see the sun die
You are the only person in the world that actually eats ass
I just got here and I already have a WINK
I know what the name of the game is
i'm at the same place, but i have a lot of friends
you can use the shield to block attacks
you need to use the shield to block attacks
jerma, why did you name this game after me
what is the point of this if he's gonna be a bad boy
you can take the sword from the girl
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GO BACK AND GET THE FENCE
I feel like you need to know what kind
====================
I thought it was a little bit but it's not that bad
please play the game i want you to play
You're going to have a huge ego
I wanna see what the new Jerma face looks like
you cant get that if you dont have a bttv emote
You can skip ahead in the game if you have the bttv emote
I'm only watching the VOD for this, can you have an edit of the last one?
you can't go back to the beginning
i got some pineapple on my pizza today
you need to do a single scene to make it work
you can do it at the end of the stream
You should of just been in the water
That's how you know it's a good game
this game is a mess. I'm out of here
guys what do you think of the new jerma
i just got here, why are you still playing this?
the only way to win is not to play
I would buy you a 2 year sub
You just got a video of a girl
You'll have to do it all over again
I am not the same with this game LUL
you know what they say about a guy that can't make a funny joke?
It's almost as if there are no hills
the game is a bit low pitch
i heard that there was a dead body in the closet
if you're gonna play the Contra Hard Corps OST
you got a few more dlc choices
What if the kids aren't in the house?
Can you play the game with a different mic?
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.
i'm not gonna lie, this is a pretty good game
why is this streamer so good at mario
Do you eat the meat of the fish?
I can't believe Jerma is cheating on us
how is it like a monkey to have an umbrella
I'll take your word for it, you're the best
You can use a green screen for the ending
can't wait for jerma to play the real game
jerma youre just gonna go back to the beginning
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaSaturn
You could just make your own characters
i have that in my house too, i'll just have to do it
I'm so glad you're playing this game, it's so relaxing
Hey Jerma I'm getting a sponsorship from Cox. I'm gonna play some of those games, and they're amazing
i have a gun to my head and its gonna take forever
jermaSun jermaJex2 jermaSlug jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY TO GET OUZU jermaWalk
its a good thing you arent playing the game right now
I had a dream where jerma looked at my stupid face and said "i'm so proud of you"
its not like a real gun is capable of killing a zombie
you can go back to the main menu
i thought you said you were going to play more games
why do you look like a french man
I have a gun to my head and im gonna play some of those games
HES GOT THE GUN! HE CAN'T STOP US!
its a good thing you arent playing the game right now
you gotta get the right one first
I'm so glad you are playing this game. I'm really pumped
Just a guy with a gun in his hand
jerma is a mental midget, he doesnt know how to shoot
I wonder what the "look" of this game is
you should have said that before the stream started
I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees this
You have to go to the bottom of the screen
its just gonna be the same image LUL
they can't just say you're a bad boy
I'm gonna say the n-word all the time now
you can get one in a hanger
Why do you think you have to go to the bathroom
you should check out the new game they announced for next year
i've had the
====================
this is the game where you unlock the world record for best mario
can we get some jerma in chat for the boys
It's not like we're all on the same page
can you play the old games from the first game?
How many jumps have you done in this game
Jerma you have to get the boots now
you can do it, we believe in you
you have to be the big rat
you could have the whole world record for this game
I'm pretty sure he's actually doing a co-op stream with etalyx
he was actually on the verge of tears
my mom just threw up in my mouth
youre a fokken psycho don't listen to him
imagine playing this on the toilet for a whole day LUL
can you do a live stream of your webcam from last year?
you're supposed to use the move controllers to do the move
you look like a headless from the simpsons
You've been playing this game for 6 hours
If you die in the game you die in real life
how does the fish have a name? jermaMars
i'll gift you a sub if you do it :)
please play it, it's a good game :)
you need to be a sub to get that
jerma's in the mood for more crack jermaPluto
I'm watching this stream as a psycho and I'm so fucking disappointed that you didn't watch the trailer for the DLC
i hope he gets a new weapon :(
can you play the game again on stream
I'm gonna go watch the VOD if you don't play the game already
you can get a ton of stuff for that
you can do a 10 hour stream if you do it right
he's going to get kicked out of the tournament
can you turn up the music? i'm listening to the metal gear rising ost
you have to do the super jump first
You have to get the boots, they unlock later in the game
i can't believe jerma is actually playing a horror game
I'm going to sleep, wake up, and come back to you to play another one of your games.
the game audio is still messed up
you don't know what you're doing jermaDisgust
Jerma can you just go back to the last mission?
try to get the longsword or staff
jerma this is a 20 hour game why are you still streaming?
you have to be in the water to do that
it's a lot more fun to just go to the bathroom
if you're going to play this game it's best to play with a controller
you can use the move controllers to do the move
you can just give the controller to someone
you have to be in the water to do that
jerma's gonna get his ass kicked by a frog
JERMA IT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
I can't believe this is the last stream of 2020
You can use the move controllers to do the move
please tell me this is a horror game
i'm just gonna go with the flow and wait for this to happen
You can literally just press the button to the left
jerma is going to die of old age
This is the streamer who died to pinwheel
you're the best player on this team
do you have a gamecube microphone?
You can use the move controllers to do the move
this is a good game to watch jerma
theres a lot of new stuff to do
you can do it, we believe in you :)
I'm trying to remember the plot of the game
he isnt using the move controllers, hes using the move controllers
its the part where you say your name on stream
you can do a 10 hour stream if you do it right
I love that he's pretending to not care
if you don't get a wife, you can't play the game
This is the best game you've ever streamed
you can do the move controllers to do the move
I swear to god if he streams today I'm gonna be so fucking pissed
I'm just gonna say it, this is a really good game.
this is the most fun youve had in
====================
I'm just wondering if you know this is how you got here
I just got here, what the hell is happening
i think you need to turn off the game
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
You know what you're not supposed to say
You're gonna get a heart attack if you keep playing
It's a horror game with a similar premise
i hope jerma's gonna be able to play all the doom and diablo
Can we get a 6 hour slow mode?
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
I'm glad I finally caught a stream and now I'm not alone
im gonna go watch the vod if you dont play the fuck off
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
you dont have to say it but I believe
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
they are gonna make a new one if you dont stop
Please do the new Animal Crossing music
can you make your own jerma rumble with the box
If you were to die in the game, would you be your clone?
jermaOld i remember when i used to have a good time
I'm so glad Jerma is not streaming today
just make a room in the living room
I love how Jerma985 always manages to make his chat more active than the game
you have to play more of it
I'm glad you got your fix dude :)
there are a ton of hidden object games
I'm gonna play this game for the rest of my life
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
you're in a coma and we're worried about you
I think you can only use one right?
if you don't finish this level I'm unsubbing
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I LIKE IT
you're not the only one who's got that
you need to get the guy that moves the other one
you just can't stop losing, you're too old
Jerma, you're a man of culture, you can do anything you want!
I don't know, I just saw a clip of him saying that
this is going to be the worst stream of 2020
you have to get the other guy
you have to do it in the last stage
this game is just a bunch of jerma emotes
I love how the stream is just him running around
why is the music like the dark souls of gmod music
the only time you can really win is if you lose
do you know what a DOS game is
you're like a newton but you're really good at the old game
we have to find the exact time he is supposed to be streaming
He just wants to see the game D:
I'm sure he'll be fine with a mod that removes the "controversial" and "unironic" categories
i'll gift you a sub if you do it
that's just the end of the game LUL
this is just your best friend telling you to go to the toilet
you can play the game with the box
this is the best stream of all time
jermaPluto he's going to have a stroke and die
YOURE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
what if I told you this is the best game ever made
You were only here for like 15 minutes
i hope jerma doesn't forget about the secret slime action
you can make your own jerma rumble with the box
I'd like to see you play KENSHI, but I'm not a fan of the game
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I remember playing this as a kid. I loved it.
Oh my god, this is the only time you can do this
you're the only one that can give me that
If Jerma streams this on my birthday, I'm going to shit my pants.
I bet you can't even play NGU idle on stream
you can just move to another game
He's not gonna show up in chat right now
You should play the game it's called MGSV
Just got here. Why is Jerma talking about a MILF?
YOU
====================
WeirdMan jermaOld
You have to have some kind of green name
if you play on console i will give you a free sub
Just say you're a fake gamer, you're only good at D2
This game is a lot of fun to watch
do it or i will shoot your face
is there a clip of the real jerma
I think this is a bit too big for it's own good
You're in a better place than ever
are you gonna stream the next Jerma Rumble?
its like an old lady trying to get a new pair of pants
I can't believe Jerma is a furry OMEGALUL
We know you've never played a video game before
If you're so good, why don't you play this game?
do you think they have a book of gory story
get the mouse off the screen and turn it on
jerma you can do it it's just a trick
i love how this game has an hour left
you should do a cooking stream where you just cook things
i wonder what kind of trouble jerma will go through
you know if they were in the desert they'd be a little shorter
you should try the new ps4 controller. it's way better
you can start the stream with a new song
Is this how you get your voice actors to play?
You should play this at the new Sonic game.
You're going to end up on a phone booth again
i hope you know this game is a stealth game
this is like a straight up fucking nightmare
i hope jerma plays my favorite game of all time, sam and max
you're gonna make a new account with a new username and your gonna stream for like 4 hours
you can hear his anger in his voice
Do you have any idea how long it takes for a bingo card to be printed out
I can't believe they actually made a VR game
you can leave and come back after
you are so bad at this game
This is the worst fucking game I've ever seen
you gotta go back to the main menu
you could play the new doom ost
they are going to bury you in a grave
I was about to eat my cereal but you did it
if you were a person you would be taller
JERMA IS GOING TO KILL EVERYONE WITH HIS NEW BARE FEET
have you ever been to the sun?
is this the streamer that got banned from twitch for peeing in a sock?
you have to get the devil deals
can you do a pogchamp for me
im gonna go pee, goodnight everyone jermaHeart
im playing this with my friends, how are you doing
i can't believe jerma is finally playing minecraft again jermaVenus
This is the first time Jerma has ever done this
Just wait for the next channel point reward
it's a dream, it's a dream to wake up
When are you going to play JUMP KING
do you have the game to play it on stream
he looks like a 90's kid's show character
he's gonna be playing this for the rest of the stream
jermaChomp HE'S GONNA BE THE GUY IN THE RING
If you're going to do it again, you better do it again
you're never gonna get to the top of the tower
you have to say the word "good" to stop them
You need to go back to the first part of the game
I'm so glad I'm watching this stream, this is great
you can put the save in the game, but you have to be in the game
You can't just do this, it's a tutorial
you have to do the hulk voice again
you could make a whole game with this game
HE'S GONNA BE THE GUY IN THE RING
You need to get the devil deals
I had the stream open on the side of the bed, and I was asleep when I saw the stream title.
jermaOld how do I stop the boomer from doing a jermaOld
I want to see you play the game
play more of the new fortnite soundtrack
====================
I feel like the only thing I've learned about this game is that you can do anything
jerma is the only person I watch on twitch at least
why is this a shitty ps2 game LUL
it would be so fucking funny if he did the voice
you have to run the clock out to find him
this is what happens when you eat the crusts
this game is pretty fun but i think its boring
you dont know what a 3rd grade is
Are you going to play that bookworm game?
I would say go for it but I know you would like it
it's just a website you put up your facecam
he's trying to get us to watch the stream
That's what you get for not making the new pet
play a game of this game
You're just gonna play more games for the next few hours, Jerma
you gotta pay the people that made it
you can use the grenade launcher for this fight
I'm not gonna lie, this is really cool.
i dont think you can actually win this game
what if you put the disc in the microwave and it's just a huge disc
this is like the first time you've ever played this game
you gotta beat the entire game for the secret ending
You can tell I'm a big fan of the TF2 team
can you do the "I'm a potato" bit again
If you fail the first level, you're a coward
Why is there a WHOLE FUCKING YACHT IN THE SEWER
I'm in the toilet, it's not a problem
The button to pull up the hose is on the bottom right
how many hours until the last stream chat?
what if we both got into the shower and jerma was going to pee in the shower
You're already in the middle of the game, you can't just do that
jerma is the only streamer who can get past the first boss without dying
JERMA THIS IS YOUR FAMILY, WE WANTED TO PLAY WITH YOU
this game isnt based on the book
I'm just gonna play a game of minecraft
I think you can use the ramp to go to the sewer
jerma you don't have to do this every time
you're not supposed to look at the ground
jerma is trying to get us to watch the stream
hey jeremy can you start streaming real quick, thanks :)
if you don't do the DLC you're a coward
Please don't do the secret boss again. I'm trying to finish this game and I'm scared.
The hulk is a boomer he'll blow himself up
why is the voice changer in the middle of a sentence
i can't believe you got to this part
do you know how to play the game?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
it's a bit scary, but it's not really scary
you have to be really good at the game
you are supposed to be a god gamer
you are missing an arm or two
the cow is gonna steal the cow
you gotta go to the cave to get the boots
will you be playing sekiro again?
he's gonna have to play the game again
I just got back, how are you doing?
you know you have to make the most of it
you need to do the tutorial again
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP THERE, YOU'LL DIE
dont forget to check the lower right corner of the screen
This is the first time I've ever seen Jerma play this game.
"I'm going to shoot him" - Jerma, 2 minutes ago
You have to buy the new boots
jerma's been playing this for like 4 hours
you should play a game called "dark souls" it's fun
jerma is a mod, he can't ban you
he's got the boots, he's not getting any
Jerma is playing as the zombie in a horror movie
just give the house to your best friends
You are playing the DLC for the game, it's a different game, but its not as bad as you might think
have you ever played the original Sonic Adventure
====================
MUPPER jermaOld MUPPER jermaOld
You have to get a wife and have kids first
dont forget to get a hair transplant :)
im so glad i got to see you play this
you know what else is better than ketchup?
you can't just use the skeleton to eat people
You can get a car with a lot of cars
no one will notice you are bald
you know you can go to the secret boss and kill them right?
if you had the power to make any noise at all you would be instantly silenced
jerma i'm begging you, turn off the music
I'm a professional gamer and I'll tell you what I know :)
how can you be so bad at this game
jerma you know you can take a picture with your phone
you have to hit the purple circle on the bottom right
you have to do the whole game again
don't forget to take the magic missile to the other side of the room
you can do it if you dont play the game :)
you're making me want to die, wake up jerma
i just got here, why is this guy talking about crack
you need to kill the thing in the water
do a voice actor for this game
theres a new one you can get
if you can see me, that means you're watching Jerma :)
jerma just wanted to see you play a game
you could make the entire city a parking lot
You can't get the cat from the tower
how many jumps do you have to complete a jump?
You know what I do, I'm not a gamer
You can turn it off in the options
you can move the shield and then shoot it
just get a beard and you'll be fine
please play dead rising 2, its free
You're like the person who wrote a book on the toilet
he was supposed to play the mario music
you can get a car with a lot of cars
I'm watching this stream, can you tell us a bedtime story?
you can move the shield and then shoot it
please start the stream im sleepy
It's called the chicken game, it's the best one
YOU CAN'T FIND THE OTHER ONE WITH THE CAR
you can't even make it to the end without getting mad
Are you gonna play any other games after this?
You know you can't just use the skeleton to eat people
I think the first game is pretty good
i have to go to work soon jermaPluto
don't you have a frog in your inventory?
do you guys think you'll be able to stream for another 5+ hours
You can get a car with a lot of cars
theres a guy who sells stuff at the inn
you should play the first game now
you can get a car with a lot of cars
I think you can find the other car
You can use the skeleton to eat people
he's not going to be able to swim LUL
I think you can just explore the town to see what you want to find
i just woke up, did he go back?
why do you think he doesn't know how to play a game
Just let the farmer eat his own shit
You can't even get the car with a lot of cars
you can go to the secret boss
What happened to your first experience with the game?
You can do it if you have the power to make any noise at all
theres a secret boss in this game
I'm going to go watch the beginning of the game
it's like when you go into the bathroom
he's only been in the room for 30 mins
do a drawing of a guy standing on a boat
that guy is gonna be a fucking NERD
the only way to save your wallet is to not use it
I'm the one who wrote the rules, I'm sorry :(
It's because you can't just play through the game
HEY JERMA, DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE A DOG SHIRT?
hey can
====================
?
When you're not streaming, just make sure to play some games with chat
What the fuck is this game, i want to play it
jermaOld the sound of this game is killing my ears
didnt he say he was gonna play more kenshi today
this is going to be a mess LUL
Just like how you promised to play this game for 7 hours
you can hit them, the animation is pretty good
you should make a custom emote of you
you can get the top half of the cap
jerma you are not a true gamer jermaPluto
I would never want to live in this city
play the game again, you can do it again
Jerma when are you gonna play hit and run
you need to give the other guy your key card
I hope he never plays the game again
did you know that there is a high chance that you will die in the game?
I can't believe Jerma is so bad at this game
you can't get that in the village
he's actually doing it because he hates us
have you ever played the doom ost?
I'm still waiting for the day you finish this

How many years do you have left to live?
you said you'd play it on stream
Jerma, I'm a student, I need to study.

i'm gonna make a new jerma account just to not make a new sub
I really wish Jerma would play Doki Doki Literature Club
theres a difference between making it or not
you can buy it at the store
i've been here since the start of the stream and i've never seen a full moon
theres a new way to take the ores out of the thing
JERMA YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER
you can play more than one game at a time
this is the most painful thing ive ever heard
i have a lot of sense. you just need to know what the answer is
You have to be an actor to be in a movie
It's not a bug, it's a glitch. NotLikeThis
imagine if jerma was a pro gamer and had a gambling addiction
I can't believe you're playing this game, I'm so disappointed
i'm glad jerma is a good streamer :)
I was gonna say the new emote is probably the best but that's not a good enough reason
i want to see jerma get the "get high"
do you guys think jerma is gonna be here for the last time?
i think you can use the same hero to do the same thing
oh god i hope this isnt a pre-stream chat
this is a good game, if you like it its got a lot of potential
Jerma I'm gonna go get a drink, please don't put this on another stream.
he looks like he's about to vomit in his room
put the mop on the door
the dude in the corner is just doing a fake voice
what about the time you got your parents' credit card?
You have to be the best at the game
YOU ARE A PILLOW THAT IS A WALKER
you need to go to the store and buy some stuff
you are so good at this game :)
you can click the people to see them
i feel like i am watching a live action movie
you need to put on the new music
you have to do a different game
get a wife so they can watch together
you have to do the same thing
you can use the same hero to do the same thing
Jerma, please, play the game that you want to play :)
this is the most boring game i have ever seen
you need to stop thinking about the ice
JERMA THE GAME IS JUST NOT WORTH IT
Why is it so hard to get a good camera with the best resolution?
I'll tell you the story of me old bones
I'm not even kidding, this is the best stream of 2019
I want to see the next jerma rumble
just get a new house and move somewhere else
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.
what is the definition of a bug
I don't think you know what a clock is
jerma is playing this so much he forgot he had to play it
you have to do the same thing twice
i feel like jerma has to get the boots every stream
You're not even supposed to be here
is it true you were born in 1985
You just went from a 5-star review to a 10-star review
i cant believe he is playing this again
you were already looking at your own stream
there are people who say that but they don't want to talk about it
What if you're gonna die to the boss
====================
you can make a new character in the town
I think theres a secret in the box for the boat
I love how you have to just throw it in the fucking dumpster
"We have the best value ice cream in the city"
I think you need to go to the shop
i love how you can just do what you want and make your own character
you need to get a handle on your message
you have to do it twice as often
imagine playing this game for the first time in years
imagine not having a sub badge LUL LUL
you have to do the entire thing again
I can't wait for the Twitch Plays Pokemon Stream
he doesn't know about the secret boss LUL
you can get a wife by selling the nudes
that's what a lot of people do when they get old
you can go to the dungeon and equip the staff
i think i was in a plane crash
I just got here, what's going on?
You don't need to pick them up everytime, just use the map
you can turn it off in the options
I didn't know you were a professional gamer
Why is there a laser beam in the room
You look like the guy from the Simpson's hit and run
I'll take a 10 hour break if you play RCT2 again
i dont think you can do this
Please just leave the game on for a while
you can get the key by hitting the button
you are the only streamer who can get past this boss in this game
jerma how do i donate for a jup
are you going to play vrchat in the future?
I can't believe you have to do this everytime
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
it's not a jpeg you dumb bitch, it's a wii
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY TO GET OURSELVES SOME CRACK jermaWalk
Jerma can't even drive a clown car, so he's running from it
why are you streaming from the toilet?
I just got here, why is he so bad?
Jerma i know you can do it, but can you do this?
this game is very well designed and very well executed
I bet you have a knife in your room
This is the guy who beat Pinwheel on stream, remember?
the only time you would ever get banned is if you had a bad joke
I didn't know that was a boomer game
This is the first time you've ever done this. You're on your last legs.
I'm so glad Jerma is doing this on purpose. He's trying to make us feel better about ourselves
Jerma, I'm going to go watch this video, please don't stop playing. I'm tired of this bullshit.
if you don't get the boots you will die
It's ok to be horny if you're not hot :)
Jerma you're gonna get banned for that
we have to make sure this isn't the last stream
When are you going to play D2 again?
jermaVenus cvHazmat haha just kidding haha just kidding
why does he sound like a robot with a loud ass voice
Jerma is the guy that eats ass on stream
You can do it, just be patient and try not to run into traps
i cant believe jerma lost to the last level
you are gonna have to play the entire game again
I'm so glad I finally got to see Jerma play Lifeline
can you put the pogo stick in front of the pogo machine please
you can just make the entire town a slum
is there a mod that makes it so you can say the funny word in the chat
hey jerma, just got here, what's the best game you want to play?
he's gonna die before he gets to the sewers
How do you not know what a hobbit is
you can get the gold sword by throwing the golden ring at the thief
i want to watch this game but i dont want to watch this game
you can add a few emotes to the main channel to make it easier for us
play the monkey game with the clown
====================
they made this game in 3d, you'll love it
Why are you wearing a backpack when you can just jump over the fence
you can play the game without the boots
you can buy more and sell them at the same time
I like how they didn't tell him to use the sword
he does not have the energy to do this
it's a good game but not a good stream game
i think it's because you have to pay for your own subscription
you can actually see the new emote in the next screen
This is like that scene from the 1998 movie American Psycho
it's a good thing you didn't play that game
how do i get back to the sub-only chat?
I feel like you should go back to the first game.
there's a lot of games that have them
that's a good way to say "I have a good time"
If you ever have a heart attack just let us know
Hey jerma just wanted to say I'm so happy you're playing this, thanks for all the laughs, it's been awesome
YOU NEED TO GET THE LUNGS FOR THE WATER
If you don't know what a pog looks like then don't watch it
is this the streamer that beat a hard level on stream?
You can beat this game in 30 seconds
You have to make your own video
this is the most immersive thing you've ever done
you're going to go bankrupt in 3 years
you have to be in the bathroom
is the emote option like a real channel?
i got a bowl cut on my head
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE WATER
have you seen the gnome? it's a full body representation of you
You should play DMC2 when it comes out
I wish I could have a Jerma date
I'm glad he's not streaming today jermaPluto
They have a bunch of different ones for different characters
this game is so good you'll remember it
you can go in the ring with the ring
you can build a boat with the ship
There is a reason you're still in this game
It's like a fully functional ISP. It's like a micro ISP
is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
Can you do a jup storm? :)
what if you're a one guy and you're a fake one guy?
The level in this game is fucking amazing
you can go to the dungeon and get the dlc
you need to watch the rest of the vod for the ending
its like the first time you have ever played this game
hey jerma if you do this one more time im gonna eat my own ass
are you going to do the lord of the rings trilogy?
he's going to shit his pants and then get spooked
you can build a boat with the ship
you'll get a lot more experience if you play the game
can't wait for the 2ndjerma video on this
Would you play the Contra Hard Corps OST?
you can get the ring by searching for it in the "help" tab
is there a way to check the time
You can use the teleport spell, it's really useful in this game
This is a good game, please play it
oh my god I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
you can also sell them at the same time
You need to get the boots for the boots
I love how Jerma doesn't know what a non-sub is
there's a secret ending that you can find
Jerma you're getting a lot of views
I was going to say that, but I'm not sure if it's good or not
you can't fight the boss, just level up your attacks and do it all over again
Did you know that you can put all the dots on the top left of your name?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8
what about the time you beat this level?
you can upgrade your house with the ladder
I
====================
I'm so glad that you guys are all having a good time
"Why do you keep saying the same thing over and over"
just came here to chat to see if anyone is using FFZ
jerma is a big boy, he's tall and short
why are you always late? why do you always have to be late?
the better you get the better you will
Jerma you can do a Jerma with a different voice
jermaHeart you're all amazing and you make my day <3
can you do a facecam so we can all pretend we're Jerma
the only way to win is not to play
you're just playing a shitty version of the game
you should play a game where you play as a dog
why is the music in this game so bad
your mic is low on your face
i'm still waiting for the final episode of season 2
this is a shitty sequel to the first
The Wii was invented by Nintendo to replace the Wii with a better controller.
you can use the longsword to cut down zombies
the only reason to eat ass is to have a good time
When are you going to play the new DLC?
LUL I can't believe Jerma's playing this game
Jerma why is this chat in the top 5 worst chat messages
jerma i just wanted to say this game is really cool
How many hours does it take you to beat this game?
i cant believe this streamer hasnt seen a person yet
but you can also use it to find the keys
you can do the rest of the game in first person
that's a lot of money you got
don't forget to put your webcam on
jermaWalk WE ARE GONNA BE THE GUY NEXT TO WALDO
This is the worst game I have ever seen
What if you were just playing a game for a living?
you just did the "drew crew" joke
you can also use it to find the keys
you can do that with the DLC :)
this is the most boomer thing i've ever seen
you could have just bought a new controller
you could have put it in a bag and taken the controller to the store
I'm just gonna say it, this is a very funny stream, you're just not a real gamer
you can use it to find the keys to the keybox
Are you ever going to do the Simpsons hit and run again?
JERMA WHY DID YOU LISTEN TO THE MOVIE LMAO
you should get a nintendo switch for this game
you're doing a great job, thank you
you can do it with the DLC :)
Make it a 5 second slow mode
JERMA YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB jermaHeart
Jerma is the only one who can even see this game
YOU'RE NOT STILL GETTING POOP POTATOES IN THE POTATO ROAD
Why do you keep playing this game
you just got hit in the head with a baseball
I have a confession to make, this game has a bad taste
have you ever heard of a new york house?
you can use it to find the keys to the keybox
I don't know how you can say that but you're the only one that gets this
I like how this game doesn't have any of the "likes"
You can use it to find the keys to the keybox
You can use it to find the keys to the keybox
is this the guy that died to pinwheel?
this guy has a gift sub badge
this is a good joke, i'm glad you're finally having a good time :)
You're a little too high for that!
you can use it to find the keys to the keybox
Jerma this is a very funny stream please keep it up
jerma is the funniest person I know.
I can't believe you're playing this game
Do you think there's a chance of getting a sponsorship?
You have to use it to find the keys to the keybox
jerma needs to play the simpsons hit and run
I'm not sure that's how that works
====================
remember to give him your strongest potions so he can kill zombies
theres no way youre gonna beat this game in 3 days
I wish there was more than one jerma stream
i want a world where jerma can't change his own oil
LUL I don't know what to do with myself
I mean you can't even call them "witches" in the normal way
He's gonna say he's a weeb and play a shrek game
this is like a very early version of the game
I'm sure he'll be able to catch up on the VOD
I just joined, what the fuck is happening
this is like a weird ass game for me
It's like a big ol' guitar with a big bass
you look like a real deal person
I'm gonna go watch a Jerma985 stream tonight
there's a button to turn off the music, you can turn it back on after a few minutes
what if you get a gift sub?
why does he look like a human being
You can upgrade it by going to the menu and clicking the options
it's the same thing as the first game
YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME WITH A DIFFERENT ARMOR
I think the best way to get a refund is to not give the money back
you can watch all the videos in the VOD
there's a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
you have to shoot the entire thing for the secret slime action
this is the best game ever made LUL
I didn't think there were that many actual people here
why are you moving like you're playing a porn game
i just got here what the fuck is this game
don't forget to add the rats as a sub
you can use the otto voice for the next stream
would you rather have a war criminal than a tyrant?
Jerma this is just the Bionicle campaign you played.
You need to go to the side menu
you're gonna be a streamer for a while
why is there a picture of a fucking goblin on the wall?
theres a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
please, do the jup, you'll be able to hear it
you gotta look at the game, it's not a good game
you can put it in your pocket and wear it with you
The AI is doing a good job
you're not gonna get a good dragon jeremy
It's not like you have any other ways to get stuff, it's just that they're very limited in their abilities
just play the game, it's fine :)
do you want to go to bed?
I just got here, is this the game that got him banned?
Jerma you can just put it in your mouth
I can't believe he's still in this game
can you say "fuck" in a funny voice?
This is like the part where you play a shitty game
play the game, it's fine, you just need to be more patient
The second time you die in this game, you get a random item that gives you life.
theres a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
just play the game with a keyboard
use the elevator to get to the bottom of the pool
have you ever considered playing the game maker game
"I'm not gonna do it" - Jerma 2019
do a second run of this game
just make sure you do your taxes first
He's gonna get so mad when he sees the credits
Jerma you can just click the menu button
It's a monster, it's going to die out.
If you're good at something never do it for free
You're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOB!
JERMA JUST GOT THE OLD JERMA CAMERA STREAMER PRERECORDED
How long has he been playing this game?
you can see auras in the blue circle on the right
it's a good thing you're not a robot
Please play this game without sound. I have been playing it for 2 hours and it's not fun.
What the fuck is wrong with this guy
jerma has a family of 9 kids
go to the wardrobe to get boots
@Jerma
====================
I feel like this is a game where you play as a villager, and have to solve all the puzzles
this is just the start of the end
I'm glad I got to watch a stream without Jerma
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -160. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i think jerma might have some bad luck
What if we just got together and had a baby
I don't think you need to make a new character
I like the way he looks at chat
I was playing this for 6 hours yesterday and still have no clue what's going on
but you have to do the tutorial @Jerma985
i love how you can literally do anything and we're all just talking about random shit
you have to write a couple of lines for the voices
Do a stream where you just pretend to be a vod boy
I hope he plays both of them, he's one of the funniest people on twitch
i wouldnt be able to watch this stream without the owo emote
The wait for the fuck you table
jermaPluto just got here, what is this?
you can use the other side of the fence to block the fence
I like the way Jerma looks at chat
i was hoping you'd make a cameo in this game
this is the most megalomaniac thing ive ever heard
this is the most fucked up stream ive ever seen
I'm gonna be honest, this is the most fucked up stream of all time.
you can't even get to the end of the game without a boss
i love how the game prompts you to make a bunch of money
jermaWalk THE FUCKING FASTEST SHOOTERS IN THE WORLD jermaWalk
you need to get the wings first :)
I think you can just use the easy bake oven
you have to do the tutorial again
When will you play Rainworld again? I wanna see you play it again
this is the most amazing thing i've ever seen
It's a good game but it's not good for stream
you can use the other side of the fence to block it
you can have a little bit of panda
oh yeah, there's a huge bunch of new games
you can see the diamond in the top right
how do you think the map works?
I hope he doesn't get so mad at himself
you have to go left on the beach
i think you can get a lot of money from that
I can't believe this streamer is going to have a heart attack
I hope this is the last time you play this game
You can get a couple of tickets for it from the vending machine
this guy has the same hair as jerma
are you ever gonna play the new fortnite?
the fact that you said "I am the streamer" is not helping the situation
What do you mean "Why does everyone hate this game?"
he's already here, he's not coming back jermaPluto
you can just use the other side of the fence
you can use the other side of the fence to block it
what if jerma is just a figment of your imagination?
im gonna be honest, this is just weird
I'm going to go into a mental asylum, its gonna be hell
use the other side of the fence to block it
i feel like this is a perfect game for this
you have to take the other side of the fence
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THIS SUCKS
you have to take the other side of the fence
can you put on a show for the whole family
What if they were both in the same room
You can get a couple of tickets for it from the vending machine
Jerma is a big piece of shit. A true gamer.
I'm going to have a mental breakdown watching this
I'm going to get a drink now jermaPluto
I'm so glad Jerma and I are together
you can use the other side of the fence to block it
You can only get tickets for one thing
can you do a stream where you just pretend to be a vod boy
the game is now on the front page of reddit
I'm so glad you're having fun Jerma! I'm so glad you're having fun!
I am a professional furry, I would have never known that.
you have to put the other side of the fence
====================
, we need to talk about the fake one
Do you know the definition of insanity
just come back and get the boots
You need to do the cutscene again
you look like the kind of guy that would sit on a toilet and piss in his underwear
this is like the end of the game
i feel like im in the wrong jerma chat
You can tell us the story of your childhood
if you want to see a video i made for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-OjxHWq_Y
what is the worst thing you can do to jerma
I just got here why is he using a water gun
what's the most frustrating thing you've ever done
I'm going to be honest, I'm not even going to ask
you are a good guy and a good person :)
i'm so excited for the rat movie LUL
i wanna play with this guy's cock LUL
the dude in the red shirt with the green shirt
what if you were a fucking alien and you were a spy
You can buy some for the pawn shop
I've never heard of this game, it's just a game
jerma you can't do anything in that room, it's too big for you
I got a gift sub last night and got the link to the stream
jerma you have to say "i love you"
you got the "bad joke" hat now
you can just make a new character with a new hero
Why does Jerma have a shelf life in this game?
if you don't play this I'm going to start fucking screaming
I want to see a full playthrough of this
you have to look at the bottom of the box
You're not gonna play this for another hour and a half
please click the link to the stream, you'll be good
you can use the shield from the side
Jerma, when is the last time you beat a level?
they're not but they're in the right place
jerma have you ever had a dream where you're pretending to be a real person and then you have to play a pretend game of you
i'm sure you can beat this game without the boots
you got a buster in the box
I don't think Jerma knows what a clown is
I'm watching this stream with my family and I have a lot of fun
Just got here, why is he playing this?
Jerma you need to change the game to viscera
you have to do the other missions
they're gonna eat the whole thing OMEGALUL
I have a feeling this guy is going to kill himself
You gotta put the entire village to sleep
you're the only streamer that actually gets paid
you are the only one who can make a video game good
Why is he wearing a tank top that's for a tank top?
you have to win the game now or else you're not playing it
i don't even know what he's talking about
jermaPluto this is why we don't have jerma awards
you can find an apple in the store
why did he put the lipstick on his face?
If you're not playing this game for the carnival stream, you're not a real gamer
you can actually buy a car with the game
why did he read that one guy's name in the title
You can't say you're not a gamer
What if we're all the same person :)
why is this the guy that ate a shoe on stream
This game is so fun. It's like a 5/10.
when are you gonna play Mother 3?
I'm starting to think that this game is a ripoff of the third world
You're like a kid who gets your own bath water
theres a lot of vroomers in this game
youre not gonna make it to the end LUL
I love that you have to win all these games
you can find an apple in the store
you got a huge head, you can just buy a car with it
You've been in a coma for the last 20 years, don't let this game get to you.
i love that the game is just a game
you're gonna need to start
====================
is that a picture of you? is that the guy from the movie?
you dont need to do it for the coin
I think you should play the game again, it's got a really good story and story missions
JERMA PLEASE READ THIS, I'M A COWARD AND I LOVE YOU
you dont have to aim for the flag
dont forget to finish the game before you go to bed
you look like a fucking madman right now
Hey guys, this is the new intro. How is he doing?
You're just fucking with us, Jerma, you're going to lose it
don't forget to check the DLC :)
You're too old to know how to make a cake
have you ever been to a country club?
The baby is going to drown in the bathtub
youre gonna make a lot of money
it's literally a game where you play as a mouse
Jerma can you put a filter on my face
Please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
I'm so fucking glad I came here to watch this stream
did you see the new patch notes for the new pet?
you got a great idea, try to get into a car accident
why is the top of the screen so small
why are you playing this and not the game
what if your not a real gamer?
you're the worst streamer i have ever seen
I think you need to put in the extra time to get the boots
hey can you give me the name of your new place?
You can get the secret ending in this game.
What if the guy in the back is just a fucking zombie
i can't wait for the jerma sub sound :)
the guy in the back has a gun
you have to use the flashlight on him
you have to kill the ape to get the secret ending
just play the game on your own
I wonder how many people have died from this
make a bed for the rest of the night
that's how you know it's a good joke
Jerma's going to be so confused when he learns that he doesn't know what a coin is
that was just a jigsaw puzzle LUL
what if the chat is full of bots
i want jerma to play with me :)
you know you could make it faster if you were to throw the balls in the air
I bet this guy was never a kid
You need to use the light to go faster
you have to be close enough to shoot it
this game is like a rehash of Bloodborne
so you can do that in every game
hey jerma can you tell me how to get to the next screen
Just gonna say I love watching you stream this game.
I think you got it wrong, you didn't pay attention
You are not in the house yet
I just got here, why is jerma so scared of this?
you can make it faster if you're close
i am so used to being a mod
why did you put the water into your mouth?
just dont tell them about the feet, that's it
You need to go to the top of the level
can you explain this game so far?
you have to beat the whole game first
you can use the flashlight on him
jerma please stop this game i'm begging you
you guys are so mean to jerma LUL
do you have the game to do this?
It's just the same game as before but with a different character
you need to change the title to "The Dawn of Souls"
I've never seen someone so stuck in a room
I hate when I see that message OMEGALUL
I'm just here to help Jerma get his bearings, and I'm disappointed that he's not doing his job.
theres a lot of stuff you can do in this game
you can't just go to the casino, you have to leave the casino
YOU'RE DOING THE ULTIMATE DUMB GAMEPLAY
you need to keep them all alive
so you can get a bowlcut with that
@Jerma985
====================

i can hear it from here in my head
this is what happens when you don't eat ass
he's gonna do a mcdonalds review stream where he tries to be funny but doesn't have the mental capacity to be funny anymore
Your mic is on, the controller is off
there's no reason to not stream it, it's a fucking joke
I was watching the VOD and it was really good
if you dont know how to do that you should know how to play
I'm going to go watch the VOD, i'll see you all later

If you don't have the boots you won't get the boots
Hey guys, just got back from eating dinner, did Jerma get to the part where he became super meat boy?

you are the only one that deserves it
Haha funny thing is that I am actually really funny
You need to buy more and have more
You can make a new character, but you're not a good one
i just got here what is going on
i hope jerma streams for a week or two
I remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream FeelsBadMan
why does he look like a dildo malding guy
you have to find the golden cross on the right side
i bet you have to build the other way
I mean, he did do the "fishy" bit again
you look like the guy who beat Pinwheel on stream
That's not even your best joke yet
I just got here what the fuck is this
i would be so mad if you didn't
If you can't beat the game, you can't play it
I'm getting a new monitor for my new monitor!
"it's fine" - Jerma, a month later

I want a fucking stream now, I just want Jerma to be happy PepeHands
Jerma Iâ€™m trying to listen to this song but I canâ€™t hear it
you can build a new town and upgrade your town with new buildings
why the hell did you do that?
just get a shovel and dig in a spot
He's gonna get the ring and kill the thing
i know you are just mad but how do you feel about this game?
Jerma is trying to get rid of chat but he's not getting the boots
just leave them in the room until the next stream
can you play all the other lego games
i think you can click on the map
I'm not even a sub to this guy
he should do a tier list of his tier lists
its like a 100 year old dinosaur
i'm so glad i was here for that
What if Jerma doesn't know how to do anything?
you just lost a lot of viewers to that
you have to do the next level
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE
the devs of this game are so talented
are you sure that was the last one?
you can't get to the top of a mountain without an arrow
you're not going to get to the top of a mountain without an arrow
I bet you have to go through the entire tutorial
I would like to see jerma play the Contra Hard Corps OST
my favorite part about this game is when you get the boots
I know you're a redditor but are you really a redditor
Are you gonna play this on stream or will you play it off stream?
It's a city made out of things you make in Minecraft
I'm starting to think that Jerma is a fucking psychopath
if you die in the game you die in real life
you can just leave the room and come back
can you play the radio song please
Why is he still in this game LUL
theres a bunch of rooms on each stage
I am a professional translator and you've been making it worse
that's a real thing. you can't get to the top of a mountain without an arrow
you know you can get it back with a spear right
Are you going to play the game again?
i mean there

you can just press the button as quickly as you want
this is what happens when you're not a boomer
the game is so fun to watch :)
just try to keep a positive balance
"You just wanted to tell us that you loved us"
You can get a good inventory item from the trader
You are getting old and you're getting old
you can go to the town center
I'm sure you could do it in the arcade

What if we were both Jerma fans and we were both Jerma fans?
you are literally the only one who doesnt know

I have no idea what this game is called but I'm pretty sure it's the same game
I don't think that's how it works jermaPluto
what's the difference between the two, i'm surprised you know this
You have to get your own car
you have to make it into a movie
YOU ARE SO FUCKING GOOD AT THIS GAME

Jerma's gonna get banned for this stream monkaS
I'm watching this chat in the dark, watching this chat in the dark
you have to do it in the tutorial
do you have any more water left in your lungs
what about when you came back after 2 hours?
I thought you were a little shit tonight
what if jerma is just a kid and we're all just his parents?
why do you always read the funniest comments
you can take the car to the bar
I don't think you know what that is
What do you think of the new Star Wars movie
I don't know what's going on but I like it
you're in the wrong place, your child is too young to understand that

====================
i thought you said you were gonna do a carnival stream
You're gonna be a god gamer and not a human

you need to get to the edge of the universe
H E L D O N G A M E
You know what they say about a guy with no arms
i like it when jerma makes a joke and it goes down a rabbit hole of funnier jokes than ever
This is the most boring thing ive ever seen
YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT LATE JUST GO
he was really good at the song tho
he was trying to do a vid and got distracted by chat
this is like the one game where you need to use your own characters
I was like what the fuck is going on
How many times have you been in a coma?
i wish i could just watch the stream and not have to worry about jerma just having to say fuck
If you dont have the money to pay them off, you have to play Legends of the Hidden Temple
you have to do it for the whole stream
Play the B.I.G OST or I will scream
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I'm a fucking millennial and I'm not even a millennial
you can do it. we believe in you :)
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
you should do a "me doin it" challenge
You can buy the "A-10" in the center of the ship
I'm going to go watch the VOD. I love you all
i found the stream and it's just you talking
HE IS GOING TO GET A THIRD FIST HEAD
I feel like a toddler trying to remember a song
I think you have to go back to the same spot
You have to make the house a real house now
would you rather have a pogchamp or a pee break
he didnt do it, he just did it
I will literally beat you up if you dont play the game.
you need to make a new character
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
How many points do you have?
I don't think you're going to beat this game, you can beat this game
there's a shortcut to the right, it's on the left
i'm not even going to tell you this
I hope you guys remember when he said he'd do the fortnite streams
jerma can you turn on facecam so i can tell you how i feel
can you play doom eternal with the music turned up
I just came here to say thanks and this is the best stream ive ever watched
jerma's gonna be stuck in the factory for the next 3 hours
Jerma I'm begging you to play the OST
This is why you don't play the game
why is this game so fucking hard LUL
You've been streaming for like 8 hours and it's already almost 2 AM
i hate that game too but it's not that bad
This is the worst thing you've ever done
I'm a fan of your youtube channel and have watched you since you were like 12 years old, this is great
the only reason i can think of a single reason that jerma is a better streamer than joel is because he's actually a better streamer
i had a dream where jerma said he was gonna stream tonight
I'm a child but I'm too young to vote
this is a bit late but can you please play the music
I wish he was playing Doom Eternal again :(
I got a gift sub today. I'm so glad
It's not a bootleg if you know what I mean
The only time I see the Wii is on the Wii
====================
 "How to make an actual copy pasta" video.
oh god he's gonna do that, he's gonna do that
i just got here what the fuck is going on
You can't just ignore the trash and say its good
I love how Jerma just gets his chat to be in emote only mode
I think the next time you stream, it'll be a green screen stream
I'd rather watch you get put on a movie
you should get a gaming chair that has a barcode reader in it
we have to do the same thing every time
i hope he streams it again so we can all laugh
Are you gonna play this game again?
i would have never guessed it was a game about a child
if you didn't know that, you'd know it was a thing
The only thing I want from a burger king is for them to tear me down
i'm just glad he's not playing anything else
would you say theres a single thing you've done wrong?
If you go back to the sewer you get the slime dragon
theres a secret room in the second floor
do you know how to do the mirror dance?
i bet jerma has a huge collection of drugs
how long has he been playing this game?
i dont think i can wait to see what happens
Can you add a few more emotes please?
it's actually a place to get drunk
this is the equivalent of a tom and jerry episode
You can't keep doing the same thing over and over
what about the time you ate a whole sleeve of oreos and threw up in your mother's bed
that's like my face, it's just a huge eyeball
I'll get you a drink and a sandwich, thanks :)
I want to see you play the game
I think you need to watch the video
I just got here what is going on
why is it always the person that doesnt die
its a bot and you have to play it
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
you should get the boots, they are really good
I just got here what the fuck is going on
you can actually use the "show us" button to make a group of friends
I want to see you play this game
I feel bad for Jerma, he is the only streamer who doesn't have a camera
If you think that's a lie, try to prove it by being in a human costume
I have a soft spot for Jerma jermaHeart
i just joined and i see this is jerma985
when are you gonna stream return of the king?
I can't believe you were such a good boy
You should get some mods to do this for you
i just got here is this the new kingston game?
You can probably get it at a local store
jerma i know youre a liar but what if you just dont know
they're just going to be called the frogmen
this is how jerma gets his youtube channel views
It's a shame that you can't do anything on stream because you're just a big, fat loser who doesn't have a single shred of a life.
you can do it if you're willing to play it
I like how Jerma just doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
please make a rat emote it's very cute
he thinks he can fight the dragon in a game
make a new emote with the same name and title :)
This is just like that one episode of Spongebob where they go to the hospital and they are a moron
i'm not sure if he knows or not
You need to be a super human to get the boots
jermaWalk GET THIS GAME OUT OF MY VIEW WHAT I WANT IS NANCY DREW jermaWalk
i'm not a doctor, but you are
you gotta get a house first, then get the gold
how much did you pay for this game
he's going to be in the bathtub for 4 hours
do you have the book of demons
I'm watching this in the background and I'm not impressed.
did you see that tweet about the next game?
did you know that if you're not wearing a hat you're wearing a hat?
There are real people in this chat
I can't believe this is
====================
did you guys see the poll last night?
I'm gonna go watch the vod, get some sleep, see you guys in a couple hours.
SOMEONE TYPE IN THE CUSTOM WHILE YOU'RE GONNA BEAT IT
i like to imagine he's just going to be playing as a bunch of bots and we'll just be all jermas
when he turns on the face cam he looks like he's been wearing a wig for the past 2 hours
try to get the main quest you gave them
I can't wait for him to lose to the final boss
i really want to see him finish this
i have to be eating my cereal right now
theres a huge one in the room
this is the most pog moment of the decade
Do you have any plans for community content night?
I got a gift sub last night, thanks for the gift sub! jermaHeart
will you be playing Vrchat with us sometime?
HE'S GONNA GET MAD WHEN HE GETS BACK
it's not like you can get rid of it
i dont even know what a vroomer is
can't wait for the stream to start and chat will be flooded with suggestions
you're a great streamer, and a great person.
LITERALLY YOU HAVE TO DO A MATCHING OF EVERYTHING
you know, that would be a pretty cool thing if you could make one
The dog is in the photo, not the game
i'm gonna go watch this movie, thanks for the entertainment
Jerma just gets the audio from the mic
i can't wait for the stream to start and chat will be flooded with suggestions
you can't just get them all at once
This is the one where you have to get the girl to come
you can do it without the boots now
hey jerma can you make theres a new emote for us?
if you press the button it turns on
you can't be a good mod if you don't use !mods
do you think you'll ever play Borderlands 3?
I love how this is the one time you actually can tell if a joke is an actual joke
you can put the door in the fire
jerma i just got back can you please not say anything for a while i have to take a shower
you don't have to look at the screen
is this the streamer that beat the hell out of a monkey
jerma is the only person that can see the sun
how many times have you gone to the bathroom and you're still in the same place?
it is a fucking pog moment, it's been 2 hours
I want to see jerma play a good game
how do i get a sub badge
You can use the menu button to preview your current location
i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks jerma smells like a rat
I hope you're doing better than this
you should play the game with etalyx
hey jerma, did you know you have a history of eating ass?
you can tell the stream is going to be a mess because chat is going to try to make you feel better
i have a really nice hair :)
YOU CAN USE THE WIND ON THE LAND
This is a real sequel to the first one
you can use it to get out of the way
This is just like the time you got arrested for throwing a pie at a homeless guy
if you put something in your mouth itll taste good
im so hyped for the new years stream
its like a lizard on a train
you can use it to get out of the way of enemies
you can put the doors in the fire
you can use it to get out of the way of enemies
i want to watch the video again but i don't wanna watch the video
you should probably get the boots, they are really good
put a fence around the weed, it'll make it easier to get through
you can use it to get out of the way of enemies
you can put the door in the fire
i want to see jerma play a good game
you have a full health bar, you can equip the shield and you can't be knocked down
why does the clown look so much better
====================
You've been playing this game for an hour, you know how to play it
i just got here and im already crying
You have to move the camera back and forth to see it
jermaOld get me some coffee before I head to bed jermaOld
theres a really good one if you go to the store
Can you just make your own character and have it be a fake?
hey guys i just got back from dinner, i'm glad i got here early enough to watch the stream :)
I hope you guys are having a good night
I was hoping to get a good sleep
you should play the new mario game
I'm still waiting for the stream to start jermaVenus
You have to do the guy from the rocket
i dont think it's possible to be this bad at video games
i would be so mad if i knew jerma was playing
Hey Jerma, I'm gonna catch you on the last level of TF2.
you can buy a level 2 or 3
this game is like dark souls 3
I don't like it. It's too early.
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 we're all one big jup here
I think he's making a joke about him being dead
I can't believe you've been telling people to submit feet pics in the discord
I would like to see the other team
just play as a zombie in a zombie game
you are too good to be jerma
you can stop pretending to be bad now :)
YOU CAN DO IT JERMA I BELIEVE IN YOU
what if we are actually the same person?
i want to be the one to get the boots
put the world record on the wall
What is the name of this game?
You don't need to read the manual. Just use the computer.
jermaWalk DREW CREW WE'RE IN MOO CRACK jermaWalk
Jerma, I have a question for you. How many times do you have been in a coma?
please turn your volume down, it's getting to me
jerma is actually the most famous person on the planet
you're going to have to fight the final boss
i feel like you're having a mental break
You can tell this guy has a strong mental breakdown
I can't believe you're playing this game right now
Why does Jerma always go to the bathroom?
jerma is so bad at this game OMEGALUL
if you want to be a doctor do a live stream of you and the doctor
i dont think youre supposed to be this bad
we can hear it in your head @Jerma985
it was a joke but it was still funny
I want to see the dude with a sword
jerma is getting so mad at this game
you should have played as the ape
he's just gonna turn into a snail LUL
You've never seen the sun before in your life
this is like that level in the dark souls 3 game
it is a good thing you got the boots
i mean it has a camera and game
you arent supposed to beat the game
He is actually going to beat the game LUL
you can get them from the market
I'm an engineer, I can't solve this
What is this about the voice actor that's in this game?
Just play the game. Just like real life.
why does jerma only talk about peepee poo poo jokes
you just got the wrong door, turn it
is this the streamer that beat the super bowl on stream?
why do you keep showing the dirty laundry
I'm not a furry, I'm a human
What if you had to use the water and still have the main character
You're supposed to make your way to the right
jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2498. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you need to go to the lab
can you do the "i'll make it" voice
Do you have the boots yet? :)
Can you say "Thank You" for me?
I miss the old jerma that didn't use to eat ass
You need to play on hardcore mode, it's very easy to get
If you didn't know that, you would've known
this is like a GTA speedrun run LUL
@Jer
====================
you could make the trees in the desert look like a zoo
theres a guide on the youtube for this game
Jerma, have you ever considered playing God Hand?
The next Jerma Rumble will be a Money Show
he said he would play more nmh but we can only get 2
I'm pretty sure theres a new one coming out soon
I can't believe you died to pinwheel
jermaWalk HE'S GONNA PLAY SOME NEW BOWSER RAY CRUNCH jermaWalk

You can do this to me with a sword
you said youd play ace attorney but it turns out youd play this game for the rest of the stream
Can you make a backflip to make me think I'm in a video game?
I hope you're having a good day
He's going to eat a shoe on stream
You can make the trees in the desert look like a zoo
you can use the rifle on the last one
This is the last stream I'll ever see you still playing this game. I'll miss you
imagine if you didn't have this problem jermaPluto
why are you using a controller with a mouse
I just got back, what the fuck is happening?
imagine if he was streaming with a vod muted
You can just go to the nearest town and explore it
How do you even get to the top of the tree?
Iâ€™m going to miss the streams and this is a great stream
Can't wait for Jerma to play Dragon's Dogma on the PS2
"I'm not gonna take the controller off"
DO THE DREW CREW OST YOU'RE MISSING IT
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
i was hoping for more sam and max
Just a guy with a gun to help you
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
This is what happens when you dont get the boots
This is a good game. I'm enjoying it
I thought he was gonna say HahaBall jermaVenus
this is gonna be a good stream jermaVenus
theres a whole island to explore in the game
is this a new game or is he playing on it now
i just came in, what the hell is going on?
he doesnt know how to use a gun
I had to go to the bathroom, and there's still a whole hour left
i thought that was the old man in the corner
Jerma, please say it's your birthday today.
is it true that you have a hard drive
I've never seen someone so happy and excited
you have to do a whole house tour with the characters
you know theres a lot of those games that are just basically dumb
you can get the gun in the garage
You could have given up and did something with the castle
Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
what did you think of the new star wars game?
it's gonna be a bit short for you
you should go into the game files and look for the code
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
jerma you should get some makeup on your face
it's been like 6 years since the last stream
do you know how to play the game?
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
why does your mom look like a twink
You can use it to get out of the way of the car
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
I'm not really a fan of the new star wars game
are you sure you didnt do it
have you seen the new Animal Crossing soundtrack?
I just got back, is this the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?
I'm so sad he didn't play this
I'm not sure what I'm looking at
I think he just wanted to show us what he's got
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
you can use it to get out of the way of the car
I think you need to be aware of the world around you
====================
can you do the Rick and Morty impression
the only thing you have to do is not make a green screen
You need to make the moonlight reflection from your nose the new thing
I'm a little disappointed he didn't take the skull
Jerma is a good guy, he just doesn't seem to like it
jerma if you don't make a rat movie reference I'm gonna report you to the principal's office
i mean, it's not like you were about to ask if you were gonna stream it
I love the ending, but it's very bad
I think I'm going to have a heart attack
this is the worst stream of the decade
this is going to be a disaster LUL
when you fail, you have to refund the game
theres no way the japanese voice actor is that good
i think i got the wrong door for this game
i wish jerma would stream me a good time
you said youd only be playing half life
i have been here for like 3 hours
You know what you want to do, right?
it's the same game but with more content
I thought you were supposed to be at the start of the stream
I wish he'd play more Kenshi :(
i bet jerma is a good streamer :)
he has a full face cam on :)
i have a headache from watching this game
you can do it in the game
I hate how you have to play this game
this is how jerma loses his mind on stream
This game is like a fever dream, you're just too fucking tired to go back to sleep
jermaWalk ON MY WAY TO BEAT THE GAME
you have to put it in the tree
I'm pretty sure you can't use the fire spell
The only time I've ever heard that joke was in a video game
Oh my god jerma can't hear us he's deaf
is it true that jerma just streamed himself watching a movie?
you're not supposed to do that please stop
I'm not a furry but I like it
this is what happens when you don't stop playing
why are you guys spamming this, it's not gonna work
You can do it with the gun. @Jerma985
why does jerma keep playing this game? it's been so long and he's already lost
my dad is like how i used to do this
is this the game where you can walk on water?
I think theres a really good one
jerma just got paid to play this game
I'm so glad I missed the live commentary
do you know how to make a game?
I have a feeling that the police are just trying to cover up the fact that you are a cop
you are gonna take a long time to beat this
I'm still not done with the shitty game
You need to do a 10x10 if you want to win
jermaPluto sorry guys, i'll never see that face again
it's ok jerma I have no clue what you are talking about
are you gonna play the new star wars update?
i hope you have a good time today
just watch the movie, youll be fine :)
I'm glad I stayed up until 3am to watch this
YOU CAN TURN OFF ANIMAL CROSSING FOR A FULL GAME
I love how you can just tell a story and not say anything
you can go into the shop to sell some armor
This game is one of my favorite games
i dont know what im looking at for the gamecube
is this the streamer that got out of a turnip?
just do what you want and play
can you do a speedrun of this game please?
I made it in to the stream and I am super tired
if you do a side mission where you play as a character you can take on the role of your new character
you can make it into a full blown mobile game
play the game, you don't need to watch it
There's a TV with a huge map on it.
you can make a green screen joke with that
why do you have to turn around to get into the water
i think the problem with the eu version of this is that it doesn't have the same language as the west coast version
you can go into the store and buy stuff
this is the most boring game
====================
that's a long time, get it out of here
theres a lot of good games in the library
I'm so fucking happy you are playing this game
this is a really good example of a well executed stream
It's like the "you don't know what you're looking for" face
He's so high, he's just dropping it all
Are you gonna play Super Monkey Ball?
I got the same thing, it's just too much
dont forget to enable chat with your twitch name
I have a lot of anger management issues
I can't believe he doesn't know about the secret slime action
theres a really good list of them
Oh yeah, the books are actually really good
you know you want to be in that movie right?
you can do it, you're not gonna do it
I just got here and I'm already MAD
this game is the funniest thing I've ever seen
I can't believe the guy who made the birdhouse song is a fucking fraud
Jerma you're making me wanna replay this game
I'm not even sure if I should get it now
how do you feel about the fact that you're doing the same voice every single stream?
why do you keep trying to get rid of the ring
I'm playing this game with my family, and I've been getting very frustrated at the same time
I'm trying to catch up but I'm dummy thicc and my hands are sweaty
The other ones are not that hard to do
Is this the guy who beat Jevil first try?
Just got here, what is this a joke?
he's trying to get to the top of the tower
You're the only person playing this game right now
why are you doing this to yourself?
You can buy the new level now!
have you ever been to a zoo?
you can buy the new level now!
you need to see a doctor if you die
The vod is going to be a disaster
you're gonna have to rewatch the whole stream
I'm just here to watch the VOD LUL
Jerma, I'm begging you, please don't read this.
Hey, I'm going to bed, good night!
your hair looks like its about to fall off
This is going to be a good stream
I can't believe you're still playing this
this is the saddest thing I've ever seen
I like how the enemies in this game are just random enemies
JERMA DONT LISTEN TO THE FUCKING MUTHAFUCKING MEN
did you see the ad that said you were a furry?
I'm looking forward to this day. I'm not gonna lie.
is this the guy that beat Jevil first try on stream?
What do you think of the new Sonic game?
I'm going to say it, the best game of all time
Why did you get rid of the ring?
What are the chances of getting a sub today?
You can't just ask them to play the game
i hate this guy, i dont even like him
I'm only here for the stream, not the stream
have you ever considered doing a cooking stream?
i'm too high to watch a jerma stream
"Hey guys, just got here. This is Jerma985. This is the most anticipated streamer Iâ€™ve ever seen. "
you can take the ring off his head and put it in his inventory
i cant believe jerma is a bad actor
I think you need to play it again
I am the Giant Rat, the guardian of SUS!
this is a ripoff of the modern day x-men
theres a save file on the pc
just get a black belt and become a Jedi
did you know that the vod is gonna be muted
you need to put on some clothes
I have a goldfish in my backyard that doesn't die
if you dont finish this i will eat my own ass
you need to find the blacksmith in the marketplace
This is a fucking horror game, you can smell the meat and bones
just stop playing this game and play something else
it's a bit early in the stream for me but it's still pretty damn good
Jerma you're gonna make me die from laughing
@Jer
====================
You're a YouTube Channel, I know that.
there is a way to go back to the sewer
you can go to the house in the first room
you have to go to the end of the game
Just go back to the house in the first room
this is gonna be like the simpsons hit and run stream
you're gonna get banned for eating the dog
I love how the stream is just Jerma and chat saying â€œCringeâ€ when it should be â€œNoticesâ€ when it notices them
why does this guy have a wife and kids
you have to turn off the game
You are getting scammed, we know it jermaPluto
i dont think youre a real gamer jermaPluto
you have to make the soup out of wood
hey can you tell us what the last episode of jerma is like?
I'm back, what's happening? I thought he was playing the Gamecube version
you can do it at the store
I'm getting the feeling you're going to have a pretty good time
If you don't do it, I'm going to be pissed
if you play as a woman, she will turn into a wolf
do you have to hold it to open it?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
i thought you said you were going to die
oh my god i forgot this was a stream
There's a secret level after this one
i wish you could say that again jermaPluto
I can't believe I missed the start of the stream
Theres a secret level after this one
What's the best way to get a refund on a game?
Hey Jerma, I'm pretty sure you've seen this video
you can go into the bathroom and piss in the sink
can you do this for the rest of the stream
You know what you wanna do? Take a picture
jerma please go to the store and buy a new controller
i think you just have to go to the hospital
I'm sorry to hear that, but you can't just stream for 8 hours.
You can play the first one without the boots
I've been watching Jerma since the very first vod, I'm still waiting for the next stream.
I hope Jerma plays this game for the first time
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL LUL
You have to find him now. He might be dead
you can turn the volume up with the power button
You should play the new expansion pack, it's called Space Ace!
you can find the book in the library
You could just stream yourself playing this game
Jerma, your house is on fire. Please turn off the stream.
can you turn on facecam for the rest of the stream?
How do you know that? Just by looking at it
If you're good at something never do it for free jermaGrin
put the map in the game awards
i think he said he was going to get in trouble
Jerma's gonna have to stream for another 12 hours
Why did you have to put the front door open
you can just turn it off and walk out of the room
i cant believe they did this to you
You have to go back to the house
can you do the "I'm gonna go eat dinner" voice again
I'd love for you to just stop the game
jerma i'm so fucking scared please keep playing
you can use the flashlight on the sippy cups
That's the face of someone who doesn't know how to play a video game
i want to see jerma play seaman jermaPluto
you can use the usb to get to the end of level
Why do you have a license to be a chef?
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
you can do the one that only gets you points
you can just find him there and search him
jermaSun WE'RE DOING IT, WE'RE DOING IT jermaSun
this is like that scene in the twilight zone
I hope he plays an actual game like this
im going to play all of these but the first one i play is the most boring to me
how much did they pay you to play this
====================
can you explain why you were so bad at this game
I'm watching the new season of mambo no 5
It's a lot of work for a game you can't even play
I feel like I'm in a fever dream
have you ever considered playing an arcade game
you've been in a coma for 3 years
it's gonna be a good joke to make
you can get a group of friends in the tavern to help you with the store
you're in a simulation, its real time
You can do it on the toilet
you can now buy a new set of boots
If you're a streamer and you know it, you're a good person
Jerma, can you put your facecam over the player's
I don't know what that is. I'm not a furry
I don't even remember this game being this hard LUL
jerma is the only thing that makes me happy :)
This is the most boring thing I've ever seen
I feel like I'm in a fever dream
you're supposed to use your other hand to shoot
HEY JERMA, PLEASE READ THIS OR ELSE READ THIS
if you die in the game you die in real life
I would have been here for the first 10 minutes
you can buy a new set of boots @Jerma985
you should play the new half life alyx mod
THE REAL JERMA IS IN THE HOUSE
why does jerma have to take his kids off the field
you can go back to the bottom and explore the cave
Jerma, you're not going to die this is a joke
You can't just shoot them, you have to shoot the red guy
you should try to get all the health packs
I wish jerma would play the silent hill games again jermaPluto
you're a big dummy you should be able to hear it
it's not a joke if you don't die, it's a spoiler
I'd rather be a jermaJup3 jermaJup4 than be a jermaWalk
you can add more than one character to the game, so it's a lot more
this is the most ive ever seen you
"I am going to buy a bunch of drugs and make a lot of money"
you can give a mod a powerup
Dude you gotta get the boots, you can't get this
you can go into the buildings and build some stuff with them
you can make your own clothes from this game
can you imagine this game being like this
jerma you have to stream on the day i die
you can make your own clothes from this game
i think you can change it to the next floor
jermaChomp jermaJex2 +2 i dont get it, its just a word
You can sell your house for $200
its a game that takes place after the war
I had a dream where you said "What are you doing" and I got mad
why do you do this to us :)
is this the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
I'm just glad that he didn't die to pinwheel
He's gonna do this for the rest of the stream
i'm begging you to play the rest of the game
this game is like a 10/10 if you're gonna play it
it was the most fun I've had watching this stream
What's the status on your prostate? jermaPluto
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
this is the most boring thing i've ever seen
this is the dark souls of being a boomer
you have to get the boots before you can use them
Jerma your mom's watching the stream with you
You can just make a new character and have the new one be you
you can make your own clothes from this game
you can sell your house for $200
you can make your own clothes from this game
You have to use your other hand to shoot
what's your opinion on all the other duck emote campaigns
is that a gun or a gun barrel?
you can make your own clothes from this game
I think you can just put the rpgs in the pawn shop

====================
you have to read the lore first before you go
I'm not even joking, this is the best game
hey jerma, what's your favorite form of water?
jermaWalk I'm a bird and I'm not a boomer jermaWalk
i feel like im in a fever dream
You're the only streamer i watch that is in the top 20
theres a new one coming out next year
theres a monster in the party room
he's just standing there in the dark LUL
"hey guys, just came here, why is he wearing a diaper?"
i really like this game. it's like some sort of advanced visual novel.
It's a grim scene from The Mask, where Bruce Banner is in the dark.
no, you can't just kill him jerma :)
You need to put some clothes on
if you get hit with the gun you can get a free gun
why are you playing as the real jerma
You got the fish. You don't need them.
if you're reading this, you're probably about to die
You can't do that, you'll die in like 10 years.
This is the best game ever made. :)
Iâ€™m going to watch Jerma eat a shoe
You have to do the things you did, and then you can do the other things
I'm not sure what you're talking about
Jerma, you're the only streamer that makes me laugh every night
you can just jump right after landing
how do you do it? is it easy?
this is just like the doctor show :)
He has an orange box on his chest, he can't just pick it up
You guys remember when he said "I'm gonna make a movie out of this"
i cant believe jerma would do that to me
You can combine your pawns into a team
jerma is the best streamer on twitch, i am proud
you can see the shine on his eyes
would you ever play any other games besides the original?
you just need to click the link
i like how jerma's getting mad at the game
This is just the best simpsons game ever made
I've seen it, it's a joke that you have to use it to get into a location
you can tell this game has a lot of secrets
You can use it to get out of the sewer!
LUL you're gonna get shot in the face
did you ever plan on playing Kenshi again?
I'm really tired of this fucking streamer, stop it
you can go to the menu, it says you got the game
you can't have a good time without looking at your own face
You have to get the coin in the pipe
I think you're just gonna need a speed boost to get to the top
You have to get the coin in the pipe.
why does it look like the guy from toy story
You can get the coin from the pipe
you can get it from the vending machine
JERMA YOU CAN'T PUT PIZZA ON A SLAVE
This is gonna be a good stream LUL
you need to do the quest and then kill him
You can do a whole game in the same time
JERMA STOP PUTTING ON A FINGER IN YOUR MOUTH
If I was a mod I would ban you
will you play the new Animal Crossing
you can combine your pawns into a team
theres a secret level if you go back
you can make the tail with the boots
I'm sure you can get a better ending if you try
why did jerma hate that game so much
i thought this was a dating sim?
You can get a better ending if you try again
you can get the coin in the pipe.
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED HIM, YOU LITERALLY GOT HIM
This is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
I'm going to make a big mess and put my whole house in a landfill
how do you get the vase from the bathroom?
what are you gonna do to it

====================
I'm so excited for the stream to be tonight
hey chat :) wanna see my top 10 most hated twitch emotes?
hey jerma if you're reading this, my name is mike
Please change the music to something better
i just got here wtf is going on
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 MAKES ALL OF DA RULES jermaJup3 jermaJup4
Do you have the energy to be a streamer?
this is the best thing i've ever seen
did he play the game yet? i have to go to sleep
you should try the new star wars game
try to keep it in mind when you play
how do you have your facecam on
there's a lot of different endings, you can probably just skip this
you should play a different game, like the one you were talking about, it's a better game.
it's like if a train comes on and goes "ooh"
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I'M A SLAVE I'LL TAKE YOUR DAMN HAT
jerma you can make a pro controller
you can't even do a perfect wink, and you're already losing
Hey jerma when are you going to play Hogs of War?
you could just do the voices from the game
you can't get past the first level
I hope Jerma is playing the New Vegas modpack
we're all going to die in 5 years
We will get you if you keep playing this
i would like to buy you a pack of gum
didnt jerma say he was gonna play the next game today?
play the song it's called "I'm a Spy"
there's gonna be a shitload of people in chat who will be so confused and won't even understand what's happening
why is he playing a game with a fucking cheatshe
You're not a real gamer if you don't have a gamer license
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY
You need to be able to walk around
Jerma is going to play the NGU idle game again
HE'S SO HAPPY HE'S BACK AND HE'S BEAUTIFUL
I just got here, what's going on?
no, it's not your fault, it's your responsibility to feed us
chat he doesn't have the money to pay back
jerma your streams are always so fucking good
I think you just have to wait for the explosion to go off
I'm gonna be a VOD boy in a couple hours
you're not the most popular streamer on twitch
I'm really glad you're not a streamer :)
hey jerma when will we get the drew crew
you should start the stream off with a song called "Grillmaster" it's about how you can make your own grill
Can you please play the song next
I'm gonna have a fucking stroke if you don't stop playing
he just told you to stop playing his game
Jerma is gonna make it in this game
I would be so mad if I did that
Honey nut cheerios is like 5 bucks @Jerma985
he was supposed to be live today
Jerma I know what you're talking about, you're making this too easy for me.
theres a way to save the save files
dont forget you can get the high score on the top right
i've never seen you in person before
you can use the generator room to upgrade your fire
you should have gotten the boots instead of this
this is like a top down sim game
I can't believe Jerma's lost it on the tutorial boss
I think you can just do it on your own.
Is this the streamer who ate his nose on stream?
I just got here, what is he talking about?
can you do the "If you're hot" voice?
YOU WERE A GOOD BOY, GIVE US A NEW ONE
this is gonna be the most epic stream
jerma you're not gonna make it to the top
I think that's why you had to do it, you have to
The last time you played this game was when you were like 8 years old
you can get the good ending in the menu if you have the game on
you can get a high score on the top right if you keep a high score
Jerma
====================
I have so many points to redeem, I'm gonna give them out
You should have had the left side of the boat on top of it
JERMA STOP PLAYING THIS AND PLAY THE GAME
I mean, theres nothing to be ashamed of
guys i just got a new sub, what's up with the old one?
I'm from the future and i am crying right now
You have to win the game to complete this
I remember when Jerma was a chad
I've never seen someone this bad at a game
It was a good stream, I just couldn't handle the first part
this is just the rat movie but worse
you gotta pay the bills jerma, we're worried about you
I'm not sure if it was because of the game or chat
I hate how jerma doesnt know what a jpeg is
you arent supposed to see the emote
How do you think of that scene from the movie The Lion King
do you have the twitch prime to watch?
jerma you gotta be careful, you're gonna end up like the big fish
it's because you took a bath in the sink
Jerma's going to lose all his viewers if he doesn't play the Contra Hard Corps OST
i hate the sound of that noise and i hate this game
We have been here for hours, just let it end
how is this guy so fast, that he cant even read chat
you can change it in the options
i can't believe you're late to your own birthday party
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
If you use the other eye, you can see the sun
if you have a dreamcast, do you have the dreamcast game?
Jerma just like in the movie, the boomer cant even get to the bathroom
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan
you should just buy the new card, it's not worth it now
is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
this game looks like it's on the n64
What's the point of the book if you never get it?
I've heard of a star that burns down your house
how do you think your grandma's grandson is so fast
if you just sit in the corner and pretend to be doing nothing, you can make it easier
you can get the red eye from the sea
JERMA I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A STREAMER
jermaPluto_HF jermaPluto_HF jermaHeart jermaHeart_HF jermaHeart_HF jermaPluto_HF jermaHeart_HF
you can use the other eye to see the sun and planets
I wish I had a sub :(
I can't believe Jerma won't play this game because he doesn't have the memory to play it
I'm getting flashbacks to the time I saw Jerma's old twitch chat room and immediately had a bad day
i'll be honest, i'd rather eat my own ass than watch this game
this game is like a 90s teen tit
jermaChomp I'm just a rat that can do whatever I want
did you know that you can buy an entire house for 1.5k?
I think you can just say it
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -8. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
You can't get it to work on steam
I just got back, what's going on?
you can get a new bike by buying new mods
what about the old people in the theater
You know what would be cool? A bunch of mario party rides
what is the best way to eat an egg
If you play RCT2, you can also do the same thing
you're not a mod if you don't have a gun
its not a joke, you are a real gamer
you can buy the new dlc pack
This is just the first mission of the game
you have to do this mission on stream
can you please play more of this game
@Jerma
====================
Guys @blueskymin @skrillex @taffer85 @blancanon_ @spleen_bean @mikeylokey @spleen_bean @jamtf2 @creeel @kamikazeraptor @spleen_bean @blancanon_ @kamikazuchi @thezalli @redspace64 @taffer85 @spleen_bean @fidofidder @wmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmw @kamikazuchi @shadowgilgamesh @spleen_bean @redspace64 @miscmess @spleen_bean @captnmorshu @thezalli @the_balla_koala @maxcomf @lewdicruous @blancanon_ @spleen_bean @kamikazuchi @kamikazuchi25
I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I would love to see Jerma play a game where he actually kills people with his own hands
It's been 5 minutes and Jerma is already addicted
he's been playing this game for an hour
if you're good at something never do it for free
you need to find a new spot for it
you have to leave to make it
i remember when jerma said he was gonna play the new sonic game
Dude i was playing this as a kid
YOU NEED TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel on stream?
theres a mod that changes the color of your character
jerma has been live for 1 hour and 5 minutes
he's gonna be late and this is gonna be great
What are you playing today? I want to see you play it
You have to go to the town
Jerma why do you say the worst thing you could say to a random person?
you can put your own face on the front cover
you could be a god gamer if you had a better pc
you're a furry, you have to be able to understand the furry conventions and stuff
go to the store and get the costume
did you see the new smash reveal trailer?
the last time he did that you had to go to the hospital
jermaPluto Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -8. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
can we get a stream of jerma making a character
he's not gonna be able to keep it up jermaPluto
this is like the best possible way to teach the cow how to speak
how does jerma have that many viewers with this fucking chat
put a banana on your head and call it a day
Just press F4 to get a free drink
did you get that burger you were looking for?
that's what you get for not streaming jermaPluto
just put the paper bag over the table
is there a difference between "prove" and "be"
i want to watch the vod but im a zoomer
Just for you, with a little help from the Drew Crew
Jerma is just gonna have to find the time to go to the casino and do a money laundering operation
YOU GOT A BAD GAMER BRAIN AND YOURE DOING IT
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -258. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
Please start the stream, I have to go to work
Oh yeah, the guy who gave out subs to himself
SourPls PepoDance (ditto) PepoDance (ditto) SourPls (ditto) PepoDance
YOU NEED TO USE THE DUMB BABY
How much did you pay for this game
he has the right idea, that's how you know it's a game
You have to clean up the vomit before you throw it in the incinerator
you arent the only one who isnt enjoying this
Jerma can you explain the meaning of the emotes?
do a 10 second face cam
there is no way this is a real level
you're supposed to throw them out of the air
I swear to god, all this chat ever does is find the one person with the lowest IQ and copy paste whatever that brainded moron posts.
It's a monster hunter game, so you're really bad
you know you can just take
====================
i have no idea what you mean, but yes i want to see you
why do you have so many dead people
I'm not going to get that one, but I'll try it
how much of a dickhead you are
He said you have to get the boots
You have to get the boots in the other game
Jerma you are the best, I'm proud of you
i like how the music in this game is so bad LUL
you can put the tree next to the ladder
You've got like 15 more bosses to beat, you're not gonna beat this one
YOU HAVE TO BEAT IT OR YOU'LL NEVER GIVE US YOUR PASSWORD
Jerma you know you're a gamer when you're dying on stream right?
this is like a boss battle in a dark souls game
jerma doesn't even know what a bee is LUL
YOU CAN SELL TONS OF MONEY FOR A LITTLE BIT
you have to jump with the super jump
youre too smart to read the word jerma
I'm having a heart attack, and you're laughing.
can you turn the music down a bit?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 12. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
that is a bong you cant have a streamer on your phone
you can also just shoot the guards
Can you explain the difference between Jex and Jex2?
I think you need to use the cheat menu
You're only 19, you can't go to the beginning
The whole game is a story and it isnt your fault
Why are you still playing this game NotLikeThis
I can't believe jerma would do this to me
You can just leave the city and come back
it was a good game but not a good stream game
you have to find the keys first
you can only use it once to make the other 4
this is going to be a good stream

That's how you know they're in the game
I think you can give him a gun to shoot you in the back of the head
i cant believe you took a hit from a can

I love that Jerma is playing this game

====================
Hey Jerma, I have a question for you.
I bet you can't beat the tutorial level
do you have any plans to do more of the sam and max stream
i don't think this game is good for you
that's what you get for being a furry
You're supposed to be the one running around
so what you're saying is, you can't get banned
I heard the same thing when I was a kid, I'm sure.
I have to go to bed now, goodnight everyone jermaHeart
That's not a dog, that's a rat, you know that?
this game is just a bunch of jerma jokes
i like how the game only picks up the first level

I like how chat is actively recommending the game
I've got a book to write for my dissertation tomorrow

you know you need to do it in a few months
i think they're going to start on the same day LUL
i'm so glad you're finally playing this game
he's a washed up streamer who just wants to be yourself
You can click on the blue button on the bottom right of the screen
you're gonna be like "WAIT" in like 5 min and then leave
i wish jerma would play the new ff7 remake
If you don't play Sam and Max tomorrow I'm gonna scream
it's literally a computer game and you can play anything
I'm sorry for the lack of links LUL
I like how chat is actively recommending the game
you're not going to finish this game jerma
It's like when you play for the first time
you're in the last part of the game

Oh boy, Jerma is going to get his ass kicked!
you can turn it off now to make sure it works
i mean, you're not even at the top yet
you should make a tier 3 emote
why does this guy keep making the funny voice
it's the one where he falls in the water
he's gonna die in like 2 hours jermaPluto
You're just going to be in the corner
you can make it in the town center
YOU'RE GONNA BEAT THE GAME IF YOU DONT

I want a refund on this game, I'm really disappointed
YOU'RE GONNA GO LIVE BEFORE I GET BACK

why does the music sound like it's trying to break it
i remember when i was a kid and my dad would come in my room and play with my old friend
if you think that's bad you're a moron
The Jerma985 Discord is running. Do you want to come to Discord?

Why are you playing this game again?
I hope the next Jerma rumble is the best one
I just got here and I already want to watch a half life gameplay

can you please say the p word i dont want to be censored
Hey Jerma, just wanted to say that you're the funniest streamer I've ever seen. You're just that funny.
you need to find the exit door
you could have just done that and you'd still be in the house
I love how they just just do the voice over
why do you have the same hair as a normal person?
i want to see the lady from dark souls again
You guys are really fucking weird, jerma is one of the most genuine people ive ever seen

you can use the bar to move items
I'm going to have to go to sleep

you were so close to finishing it, but you kept doing the stupid voice
you're going to be in my nightmares monkaS
The other one is the original

the door is on the other side
That's the reason I don't have any friends
it's literally impossible to do this in a week
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME
You said you would play more Kenshi tomorrow, so I'm gonna give you my sleep schedule
Can you explain the story of how you died to Pinwheel?
I'm pretty sure you didn't play any of the other games
can you explain the joke to us?
You are a little too close to the mic, I'm sure
hey guys what's the point of this thing
jerma i have to go to bed can you guys make me a little bit of bread
I can't believe Jerma is going to get a virus from chat

have you seen the way the cow is shitting?
You know you need to get the boots, right?
i'm so glad i didn't miss any of this
can you turn up the music a little bit
I'll have to leave, I'm trying to watch the stream!
how long do you plan to stream?
You just missed the second phase, you need to use your strength
you need to be in the center of the planet to hit it
I think you're making a mistake because you didn't do it right.
you need to go to the beach
I've been here for an hour, I still don't understand how you can still be playing this game.
its because of the DLC, but it's like the full game
why are you still playing this game @Jerma985
i hope he plays the new resident evil 2 remake
you can't just pick it up and put it back
I think you're gonna get arrested for using a spoiler
why are you just standing there watching us?
you can just skip ahead in the game
I'd rather you just be a villager in the movies
This is a really good game, I can't wait
you can get a shitload of money from that

I'm always so happy to see you playing this game
it's like saying you are the bad guy
You can use it in a room, not just a room
you can't, your character is only 1 hp away
i wish he played it like this again
I heard there was a secret ending

You know what they say, when you're thirsty for something, you're gonna get it
you know you can get a new one if you dont have a new one

I got a gift sub, did you even play the game?
you could have just skipped and gotten the boots, you'd have won the game
Jerma I don't think this is what it looks like
I'm so sad. I'd rather die than have this streamer play my favorite game.
i dont think you can use the spear
Jerma, play the book that says you're a furry
you are the only one that makes me happy
You have to do the 15 second "play game" sound
you have to play the game for you
i think i know what you mean LUL
you can make your own food with this
oh fuck, jerma has been playing this for 4 hours
you should check out the new Star Wars game called Darth Plague
dont make me say something stupid I know you won't read this
This is just the last game of the game
You can try the new one, it's a really good one
you can also play the game online and have chat play it
why is your hand on the table
I hope you play as the giant rat in this game
I would like to see you try the cool mode.
they're gonna get the shit beaten out of them
I think you can use the water gun.
is it just me or is the audio messed up?
You can make your own food with this
is this the guy who lost to pinwheel?
Make a new character and play as a different one
you just saw a streamer lose to a tree
I'm still trying to figure out what the hell is going on
jermaOld i need to get my glasses out
Do you know what a zoomer is?
you need to find a real car
I think you can do it if you just put the game in the trunk
I'm so glad you're finally playing a new game.
just dont be a dick, the game will let you
i think you can go to a doctor
You can just take the item and just put it back
I'm not sure he's even gonna make it to the end of the game
You can use the water gun to make a fish.
you have to do the tutorial and then watch it
Iâ€™m getting ready to go to sleep, thanks Jerma
I don't like the sound of it :)
you know you can just pick it up from the trash, right?
you can make your own food with this game
that's why you're the only one here
please make it so that the jerma sub sound is louder than it is
What are the chances of seeing a gamecube game in 2019?
This is the most pre-stream chat I've ever seen
you can get a free IPod with Twitch Prime, just search for "JERMA985" in the search bar
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is just a joke
i am so excited for this stream, i am so excited for jerma to play this game
the game will let you beat it, just put it in the trunk
When will you be playing the new TF2 expansion?
I'm just a fat little nerd, please don't make fun of me
you can probably find another one and then upgrade the first one
why is there a music box in the background
you can get a free IPod with Twitch Prime
im a little late but im sure you could have made it
@
====================
Jerma is doing the "just dance for me" bit again
he doesnt know what a coaster is
i know a girl who works at a hospital and she is a nurse
chat stop being so mean to jerma, he's only been streaming for like 5 minutes
i remember when jerma used to stream
You have to actually see it, it's a cheat to play without it
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE
what if you get hit by a car
you have to turn off the music
you should stop doing the bit where you have to pee
What the fuck is happening, i just got here
I heard a rumor that the game was gonna be the last one
Is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?
Why do you have a rat in your house?
Jerma is just trying to be cool and to be hip
Did you not see the new character in the remake?
hey, just got here, why is jerma so compact
you need to keep running, it's not gonna be the same
you have to take the gate off the map
Jerma you can't do this, this is too much effort
why did he just walk into the bear trap
you're gonna die in the first hour
You can't just tell people to fuck off if they're going to go with the flow
S T R A L L I N G
what the fuck does that even mean LUL
just have the player character with a gun fight
The only way to win is not to play
You can't just cut a guy's head off, you need to cut the head
Oh god, I can't believe I'm listening to this music
I wish Jerma would play more shitty anime games
I wish Jerma would show us his goth feet
You could have just put a bunch of stuff on the floor, and just let the door be the door
get out of here, you're making me hungry
why do i hear the music in the background?
i mean theres no point in being bad at this
what is this "chat" shit? is it really a game?
you can check the list of saved games
did you know that the original "Jerma" was an acronym for the Jerma985 Twitch account?
this is the most frustrating thing ive ever seen
you know its gonna be a good stream
It's a 3d model of the rat
why are there so many people in a row?
There was a knockoff version of the game
I don't have any money, can you make a second Jerma985?
he is gonna be late for work jermaPluto
this is the worst joke of 2020
its the one with the headless guy
you have to pay for the carnival stream
you need to be able to run in this game
i cant believe jerma is playing a fucking carnival game
please for the love of god play viscera cleanup detail
imagine paying for a twitch stream with a bunch of money
You can switch between them with the dpad
I hope you get to the end of the game
It's the "don't do that" bit, Jerma
if you die in the game you die in real life
this game is just a ripoff of the dark knight xd
he's not going to make it back up
why would you be playing this if you didn't want to play it
I like how he's playing this game for the first time
this is a trainwreck, not gonna lie
you cant just eat your own shit tomatoBWL
you can just run into the wall to get a shield
You have to tell him to use the grappling hook
you can stack it and pull it out
I like the sound of your voice when you say it
can you tell me how to do this?
jermaOld back in my day we did it
Just joined the stream, what's going on?
you gotta get the boots for the secret boss
I'm looking for a friend, I'm so excited
you need to go to the water
if you're good at something never do it for free
this is the most boring thing ive ever seen
you have to
====================
This is a really good bit of lore
why are you wearing a diaper on stream?
jerma is just making up excuses to not stream today
you need to find the one person in the audience that actually likes your video
how many channel points for a picture of your feet
i mean, you could just do it in the shower
If you could do a better job at this game, what would it be?
i love how the vod is still muted
I think you need to change your appearance to match your character
you look like the guy from GTA V
this game was made by a bad company
i don't know what to think about this
stop playing with the weapon on the ground
You have a 90's thing going on
it's not an ad, it's a platform
you can put a bunch of stuff into the middle of the floor
if you get 3 more lives you can get the secret ending
why does the old man have a face?
I have seen the funko pop for like a year and I'm still shocked
I'm pretty sure the secret ending is just a cheat
that's a really cool look in your eyes
do you have to go to the store to buy stuff?
why are there two naked women in a bath?
why is this game a little too scary
you need to go to the store to buy stuff
you're only supposed to get one of those
I bet he'll be back to this in 3 years
he's gonna die of a heart attack jermaPluto
I think it's gonna be a 2 day stream
i have a feeling he won't be able to beat it in time
jerma please play this for the rest of the stream, I'm begging you.
The game just doesn't want to admit it is funny
This is the worst stream of 2020 LUL
youre supposed to be in a bed with a bunch of others
I'm not gonna lie, this game looks pretty good
you could do a whole stream where you just walk around naked in public
you can do this in the other game
you can do it in the other game too
oh i remember that i was in the chat
you have to fight the boss to get the secret ending
you can find more heroes in the dungeon
You can get a better sword in the dungeon
remember to go back to the hub!
you're not even the one who got it
That's not the way to talk to kids
I have to do the dishes, but I'm sure you're happy to see me. :)
It's the same as the other one @Jerma985
he gets so mad at the game he tears his shirt
you can go into the main menu and find a new game
you can use the wrench to wrench stuff
can you please play the new "Life's Dogma" music
you can make a room in the castle
I love you but this is just so bad
do you know what a creeper is
jerma, you can play this game in the other game
you can get the secret ending in this game
theres a video of the stream and its actually a good one
you have to complete the level first
are you gonna play the sequel? :)
jermaSun I can't wait for the funny joke
when are you going to play the sequel to Tony Hawk's Underground?
I just got here, why is he doing this?
i remember you saying "you know what would be better"
Do you remember the last time you saw Jerma?
Hey jerma, I have some news for you!
you can use the b button to open the menu
will you be playing more Kenshi again?
do you think you will ever play the next full game?
You can do the DLC if you play as the guy from one of the movies
you can use the wrench to wrench stuff in the main menu
I'm sorry, I don't know what to do with this
i was in a car crash and you died
When are you going to play Call of
====================
T IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOU'RE IN A COMA
If you have no idea how to play, you might like to check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XuJhb7F-Y
i know what youre talking about but this is what happens when you have a bad dream
"Hey, this is the best game ever made. Great stuff"
I want to go back to the dark souls stream
The AI is a little slow compared to the first game, but it's still better
You need to build a fence around the entire place, it'll make it easier
so i just came back and he's still here
This game is actually pretty fun. This is a great game.
you have to be in the middle of a big line
you're the only one who can do this
it's not really a stream game, it's a video game
You can do it Jerma! You can do it!
you should play as a hero and not as a villager
jermaJex jermaJex2 i'm back jermaJex jermaJex jermaJex jermaHeart
you can make the triangle triangle button in the options
Jerma is playing this game because he loves us
You can do it Jerma, you can do it
"I'm going to call the cops on you"
can you please do the tutorial again?
you need to do a little more creative with the hand
He's gonna get a double d because he can't beat the first level
This is how Jerma makes his money off of streaming.
why are you playing this game? you know you're bad at it.
do you have a pulse? do you feel something?
is this what you do in your free time?
i got a test today, did you do it?
i love the "oh shit I just noticed a new viewer" sound effect
jerma has the attention span of a 10 year old
I heard you can play custom robo
I wonder if you can do it again
"Oh yeah I think I can do it"
you don't have to press anything on the screen
i'll donate $200 if you play the entire game
i just got here, why is he using the bathroom?
this game is so weird but so good
LUL you can do it if you try
you can put a fence around the entire place to make it easier
This is what happens when you don't play the game.
This is like the most boring thing in the world
it's a fucking mess, you can't get over it
I want to go back to the dark souls stream :(
you should do a community night where you're all here, sing the rats song
I hate when you get a random alien
you need to stop being mad because you are a moron
this is just the m&ms intro song LUL
I've been a fan of the Halo series since the very beginning
do a 3-day stream where you're all here
The only reason I remember it is that it's from the movie The Room
you can use the scout as a melee weapon
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
have you considered playing the entire game
How do you know what is and is not a spoiler?
you are not, you are not a scientist
you are going to run out of time if you dont do it
you can do it again if you do it the other way
it's so weird seeing a single person say that
can you do the family guy house in one of those
this is the worst game of all time
jerma you can get the dragon from the secret room in the castle
What if you were to eat a frog and it would be a big rat
I was here for the labo stream, didn't know what was happening
I don't have any friends, but I have a pretty good social life :)
you can use the scout to hold a gun
What do you mean you're not a real gamer
You could play the whole game on your own
I just got here, why is he playing a Nancy Drew game?
you can use the scout to hold a gun
I'm
====================
jerma I'm just trying to enjoy the game please finish
I don't even remember what's going on in this game
I'm going to be here for the stream and I'm going to miss it
he has the same voice as the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
You're just playing a video game, you know that right?
there are many more modes to play @Jerma985
If you want to know the truth, just ask the lady in the diner.
You have to get the 2nd one first
If you don't play this game I'll actually die
just hold left trigger and move it with the X to dodge
This is the most generic game I have ever seen
the only way to win is not to play
It's like a baby rabbit with a shiny tail
is this the streamer that beat the CUBE ON STREAM?
why do you have so many holes in your house
put the food in the microwave, it'll make it a little easier
There's a point where I'm gonna do a full playthrough and then I'm going to miss it
why is this streamer so bad at videogames
please say penis before you say it
i want to go to bed, but i have to catch up on the vod
there is a mod that adds a new layer to your inventory
this is what happens when you don't finish the game
I have a long list of games you should play
Jerma you can skip the tutorial by right clicking on the screen
i have a feeling this is the game that got you into the game
if you don't get the boots I will be really upset
why does this streamer have a normal looking face
that was so much fun to watch. i love this game
You have to get the boots now
that means you should be in the next jerma rumble
I'm going to be so sad, no stream today
I'm gonna go get my dog, we have to see if he's okay.
you have to use your brain to understand
I'm really sad that you left this game on, thanks for another great stream
you can make a bunch of different endings in the menu
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys look at this totally real jup jermaJup3 jermaJup4
Jerma is going to be a fucking mess this stream
why is your character in a bikini
did you hear about the new Star Wars movie?
you have to click on the ones that arent in the bottom right
you can get the boots by right clicking on the screen
Hey guys. I'm gonna go take a shower. Do you want to come back? :)
you have to use your brain to understand this game
I just came back, did he get the boots yet?
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID THAT
This is the second time this week Jerma has died to pinwheel
you have to make it big to go to the top
I'm sorry I have to go to bed
it's almost as if you've been sitting in that chair
He's going to do another green screen stream
You can go to any of the other towns
The original Fire Emblem has a really good story, so much so that the sequels were pretty bad
jermaChomp HOLD THE BUTTON IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SHOCK
I'm so glad I caught this stream, it was very fun
"I'm so glad I got to see that!"
i think that's what happens when you dont follow the tutorials
i think this is the best game in the series
I think it's only going to be like 10 people
Have you seen the new GTA 4 mod?
it's the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
you can just make the house a jungle house
You could have just skipped the tutorial and just been doing this
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID THAT
you got the boots by right clicking on the screen
I'm getting flashbacks to that one time I was watching an ad for a game Jerma played
play a different game this is the streamer that lost to pinwheel
you can get the boots by right clicking on the screen
its fine, you can just play it

====================
THEME FROM THE MOVIE WHERE JERMA IS LIVING IN THE HOLE
Is this the guy that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
Jerma I want to go to bed, but I have to watch this stream
you need to do the "no more heroes" thing
this game is just a shitty 30 minute jigsaw puzzle
I'm really excited for the carnival stream :)
but im a virgin so im not gonna
I'm so glad he's playing this one jermaHeart
can you play the shitty PS2 game
JERMA YOU CAN TURN THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF
I hate how much I want to watch this
i think you should be a substitute teacher
I'm not sure why I'd be so hung up on this one
what do you think of the new dlc?
Jerma you are going to lose to this boss
jermaFireman jermaFireman jermaSour jermaSour jermaSour jermaFireman jermaFireman
I'M GOING TO GET MY JERMA POG IN MY EYES
you can hit the touchpad button to skip
Did you know that you have a massive penis?
if you die in the game you die in real life
You need to watch the new Smash Bros.
you said you'd do a backflip but now youre doing a backflip
You have to take off the helmet before you can do the backflip
I wonder what jerma's going to be playing today
the original "prestream" was the one that got the most viewers
I think he should be a bigger character in the next rumble
You need to go to the secret room
that's the first time i've ever seen him so much of a gamer
Have you ever played the old Planet Coaster?
I'm not sure if I like this game
you're not supposed to do that LUL
It's an arcade game, you can't play it
Jerma what do you think of the new Mario RPG
If you want to play with others just do the tutorial first
SOMEONE SPAM THIS LINK FOR THE LOVE OF GOD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc5PfCfRjg
Is that the same house as in the second game?
why do you keep trying to make me laugh
I can't believe Jerma was the one who died to pinwheel
I made this one for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbQ_cxM9YVw
What's up with the American flag, I'm just here for the music
are you going to play the new Animal Crossing?
you can make it out of clay
you've got to do the other mission to get the blue key
Can you please tell me you have been playing this game for 4 hours
you can change it to a dodge
make the green screen movie night happen
Jerma I think you need to take off your helmet
This game is a lot more forgiving than I remember
you have to beat the game now
you should play a game with an actual story
you're not supposed to do that! its a mistake!
dont forget to do the carnival stream
YOU CAN EAT A BEANS WITHOUT HAVING A HEART ATTACK
What is this game, it seems like you're playing it
I love the guys who make "Dawn of the Dead"
i have no idea what is going on
why are you so invested in the game
Oh man I hope he plays this again
Jerma if you don't turn on facecam im gonna puke
If he dies in the game he dies in real life
you have to take off your helmet now
what's the story behind your boston accent
this is a top down view of your house
you're not even a boss in this game
I am the guardian of sus! I thank you for casting sus!
I have a theory that the pig is the one being attacked by the monster
I think Jerma's getting tired of the tutorial
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
Hes going to shit his pants if he doesnt get the boots
I think you should have just done the quest first
That guy is not a
====================
This
you should play the game in a more accessible way, like with the music
you have to do the dog voice to get the boots
can you do the voice of the dentist guy
It's only a matter of time until you get the boots
i got the last one too :) @Jerma985
dont do the "I don't want to be here" joke again
I've never been to a zoo in my life
THEY DONT HAVE TO SEE THE GATE FOR A BOTTLE
You can just say you need it and then get it back
you should play a game with a real singer
I'm going to fucking punch you in the face
Just came back from the bathroom, did you get anything good?
theres a secret boss in the game, and its really easy
have you considered going to the casino?
dont worry jerma, it doesnt matter what you do
Play the music for the song "Dogs Go To Town"
I want to watch Jerma play this game
you can find the golden rares in the village
please go to the museum and collect the key
YOU HAVE TO DO THE VOICE FOR THE VOICE
its a knock off dlc game, you can play as the protagonist
I think you can find the last mission in the dungeon
You gotta do the voice for the voice
will you ever return to the game?
are you sure that's not the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
this is the dark souls of animal crossing
you can use the door on the left
you could do it in the wrong order
do you know how to play the game?
you need to find the door on the right
you are a 6/10 on the best games list
you can use the door to get the boots
You can get the boots by doing this
I'm watching this stream from the bathroom, what is happening?
you have to make it a movie
You should really make the golems into humans
Jerma, can you turn down the volume a little?
you have to go through the whole game
you can put it on your character
I'm back from the store, where I started, what's this game?
you can get the boots by doing this
I think you can do it without boots, you can do it without boots
you can get the boots by doing this
you can get the boots by doing this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n5pFFPSlW4
I hate when youre playing a game that isnt even on steam and its just one guy
jerma if you dont pee in the shower im going to piss my pants
It's like a bootleg warioWare, but with a full body camera
Have you played Monster Hunter World yet?
you have to go through all the doors
"I'm gonna start streaming tomorrow" --JERMA
hey jerma can you turn the music down a little
You can use the door on the right side
JERMA THE HOMER LITERALLY MADE THE FISHED WILD

You can get an alternate ending if you have enough time
JERMA YOU ARE SO FUCKING LOUD, I AM SHITTING AND PISSING AND PUKING
You have to go in the room and get the secret key
Jerma you should play more of this game
why is he wearing a wig on his head
what if there was a deepfake of jerma from the past
There is a rat in this game, it's called a shpee
This guy is too good for this world
S A V E S H I T
you have to ask her if she knows about the dream
I'm a bit worried for you Jerma, this is really unsettling
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET THE FUCKING TREE LUL
jermaOtto otto is in the chat RIGHT NOW jermaOtto

I'm so glad I got to see you play this game
I'm gonna have a panic attack if you don't play it
this is the last game of the night
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
hey guys do you think jerma is actually gonna beat this game today
Why are there so many people in a row?
it's like a shitty game where you're in a game of poker
You know you want to be a famous person
what if they don't even know what they're talking about LUL
I was just here for the stream and I didn't know there was a stream today
you can press shift + click to do a bit
what is the worst noise you have ever made
i just got here and he's already beating it
If I was a mod I'd ban you
you have to do all the voices at once
do you know what a bed is
how do you get a new mic jeremy
you don't know what a shpee is
you should play the "Dancing Queen" song
just buy a bunch of resources and go to the town
What's the point of a rifle if you don't aim it
this is the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream
if you say "no" you have to go to the secret boss
what if we kissed in the closet together :)
This is what happens when you don't save!
jermaOtto otto is the best Otto I know
its not like you're a bad guy
I don't have a clue what you're talking about
The music is giving me a headache jermaPluto
are you going to do the Labo stream?
I thought this was supposed to be a chill stream
I know how to make a burger, I just need a few bites
i was gone for like 30 mins and he's still doing this
the cow is just a rat in disguise
jerma, are you gonna play the new xbox 360 version?
Dude this game is just too good to be true
i have to do my taxes tomorrow jermaPluto
You can change your color in the options
You could be making a cake on stream
you have to have a certain amount of points to use emotes
you would never have the ability to read chat
I think it's time for you to take a break, we're getting close to the end of the game
what if you're the bad guy in the game?
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ WHEN I SAY "TIME" YOU SAY "TIME"
You can just go back to the game
YOU CAN'T MOVE IT'S TOO HIGH OF A HIGH
you can use it to get the secret car
im so glad youre playing this game
You can also do it with a tool that makes it easier
I hope he doesn't fall into the pit again
How did you not know this was a game
jerma isnt even doing a single point joke
imagine being a mod and you see this OMEGAL
====================
do you have the clip of the last dunk tank?
you can use the "find item" button

Jerma if you don't show feet I'm gonna lose it
he'll come back to you in 2 days
you need to learn the game's mechanics
if you have to say what you're doing, it means you're doing something wrong
did you ever watch the new avengers movie
You can't just shoot and run at him
you look like you're about to kiss your mom
That's why you have the shpee face
I want to get off Mr. Bones wild ride

do you think you'll be able to stream the new Star Wars game?
If you could have one guy's deck, would you choose card advantage or just card advantage?
the new rat movie is out now
The sound of you crying is making me cry
you can actually tell the devs made this game for them
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
There is a timer but it's the same as the real timer
just let him eat all the food jermaGrin
you don't have to press the button every time
THEY'RE ALL IN THE FOLKS WE HAVE TO GO
jermaSour when you can't prove something to your viewers

you can make a house in this game
That's the best one of the game LUL
you can eat the other candy from the other candlesticks
The boots are for the security room, you need to get a key
Do you have a place for them?
Can we get a new emote please
this is the most un-jerma shit I've ever seen
that was the most cursed thing ive ever heard
don't forget to bring the hotdog bag
you can always use a dvd player, you don't need a dvd drive

You didn't do the lego lord of the rings game

you can just make a whole food chain
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk

You can probably just ignore the water, it's easy
you're like the most normal human being I know
this is a good game to have a conversation with
Just do it if you can't do it
Do you have a website that tracks your streams?
it's not the same as a normal game
i just got here, why is this guy pretending to be bad?
you can look at the other candlestick
Theres a way to do it in the menu
there is a way to get the statue
I'M CALLING IT, THE GUY THAT SAID TO BECOME A PENGUIN

You don't have to press the button every time
JERMA YOUR CHAT IS BROKEN IN HALF THIS ISN'T A GAME
YOU CANT BLOW UP A ROCKET WITHOUT A GUN
I wonder what the game is called, but I don't think it's called the same
The game will let you do that
you can go into the big storage room in this room
You could say "We're gonna play a game of this"
I'm so fucking hyped for the new Jerma Rumble
what if you have to do the same thing again?
theres a thing you can do to
====================
 at the top of the screen
You can't keep playing this game, this is the only way to play.
this is the best thing to happen to the stream
can you turn your mic up please
it's not too hard, but you have to go through the whole tutorial
i can't believe you took your parents to the store and smashed their front door in
You don't need to tell me what to do
I am a lizard, I just want to live
If you run out of money you can always gamble
I think this is a great way to get around the game, it's like a better version of the original Mario RPG but with the big mini bosses and mini games
jerma play the Contra Hard Corps OST
jermaWalk I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU RISE AGAIN jermaWalk
I like how the game doesn't tell you which option to choose
You don't need to do anything to get past the first level, you can just stay in place
why is this game so good, i love it
i want to see a streamer play a game that is good
you don't need to do anything, just stand still and do nothing
I was so confused as to what to do
if you dont kill the boss it will be easier
dude i just got here what is this
I'm a lizard, I just want to live.
If you run out of money you can gamble
You can't buy a house on stream
he's doing the good job of the city
You're supposed to be streaming the entirety of Hogs of War, so it's a great game
YOU CAN RESTART UNTIL YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND
Make sure to get the boots, they are really useful in this game
you can't just make it so theres no one to kill, you have to have at least one death

imagine being the only person who can't find the old guy's room
"You know what you want to do?

I am a lizard, I just want to live :)
You're supposed to be streaming the entire game
jerma this is a giant rat you can do anything
have you ever heard of the game "Flipnote"?
you have to start over at the beginning
I'm surprised there's no switch to play this with
This is like a 10 hour stream but shorter
The boots are for the game you're playing
I've never seen someone be so bad at a game
remember when you said you'd be in smash
do you have to be in the same room as a character?
I feel bad for the people who would spend 3 hours on this
jerma just do it on a couch in front of the mirror
you can just run away from it
YOU'RE GONNA GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE
I'm not even joking, I'm 100% serious
how do you not know what you're doing
I love that this game is just a bunch of people getting paid for the same movie over and over
you have to make the only exit into the wall

you're doing a great job, keep up the amazing work!
jermaWalk OLD MAN BLEW UP ON THE BOAT jermaWalk
you dont have to do anything, just spam
I hate when people just read the title of the book
You can just select all the members and put them in the same group, just make sure you have enough people for them to get to each other

That's why you're the best streamer

Jerma please, you're ruining the stream for me and my family.
this is just a whole episode of sam and max
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2
THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE THE HAND IS CLOSED
how are you so bad at this game
it's like a fucking fever dream of a game
can you turn your mic up i can barely hear you
i think you are going to die of a heart attack
can you add a fucking point reward for 100k?
I bet you like the meat on your plate
Are you gonna do the scratch tickets thing?
it's a real thing, you can just walk around
if you don't do it, I'll be very disappointed
jerma you have to put your penis on the camera
you should play the H.E.R.A.M. game
Did you see the new feature in the new update?
jermaOld this is the game i want to play
You should do a fake vr stream with some games you've played
if you don't know what a fidget spinner is, go watch it
you can put the wii in the microwave and use it as a power source
You guys are the reason he died
they were all here for the carnival but you didn't
Are you gonna play that new Family Guy game?
how about that youre too old to have kids
I'm not sure what this is but I can feel it.
you can just go to the store and buy one
this is the least impressive thing ive ever seen
You can go to the store and buy one
you're in the wrong category. This is a top tier game.
I have a cold and I'm so tired
If you don't know what a burger is you're in for a fucking disappointment.
imagine having the power to tell you what to do
you can do it with the wii controller too
if you dont want to use the gamecube it's ok
jermaPluto he was a good boy but he never lived up to the hype
Hey Jerma, I'm trying to start a new business with my friend Mike from Morgan Stanley. Can you help me with my taxes?
You know what they say about big toes...
if you don't get it im going to kill you
You can get a BUNCH of french fries with that
They don't have the expansions for the DLC
you're just a fucking sociopath and it's okay
Can you please turn the game music down a little?

====================
JERMA YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT THIS GAME
I think it would be funny if you did a 6 hour stream
but i dont know how to react to it
You can probably just build a school and have your own park
im not sure what is happening with your head, maybe it's just me, maybe he is just feeling better
I'm not sure if you mean I'm not talking to you
I don't even know what that is.
It's like watching the dentist play a video game
just say "play a game" so they can see it
he's got a gun to his head jermaPluto
why are you not playing any of the games on the list
you can go back to the portal there
It was because you didn't take a shower
The only way to win is not to play
the second game is so good, you can't even beat the first one
What do you think of the new Fallout 76 update?
this game is like some of the best shit ever made
I'm sure you could do a 24 hour stream with the Cooking Simulator Vr
Make a bit of the water bubby
i would rather eat a whole turkey than eat an entire human
he literally just said that it was the "worst joke of the decade"
you have to beat the game on the hardest difficulty
you need to have a dex build
you can use the arrows to find the teleporter
just click the bell in the center of the screen
jerma just say you are going to beat this level
Play the DLC, it's really good :)
"It's a dead guy" - Jerma985, 2020
I can't believe you died to pinwheel
I feel like that's what he was trying to say
I feel like Jerma should be a top 10 streamer
You're gonna have a heart attack on stream
YOU CAN DO IT BY TRYING TO RUN
jerma how much do I have to pay you to eat a shoe
you gotta run to the top of the mountain
YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Are you going to play the entirety of Deus Ex?
You know the one you're looking for right
you could've made a vr game out of it
I've seen the one in the bathroom
you can't say the line without the line
can you go to the "back yard" for more items?
If you do it again I'll donate $5 :)
I thought you were gonna play the sequel
I think you should have used a chainsaw
You got a good showing tonight Jerma
you just made it look like you were walking around
my grandma will be watching so i will not
i have to get out of bed early
that was a bad joke i am so sorry
you're gonna get the fucking drugs jerma
that's a shame, they're still doing a good job of not trying to make it seem like they're making a bad game
Jerma has been in a coma for the past 10 years. Please wake up, he's in real danger.
I'm so glad you're playing this game. I love this game so much.
jermaPluto I wish I was in his shoes
the joke is that he is a dog
I love how the music makes this game sound really good
It's not that bad, just not as good
if you get hit with the spear, it'll reduce the damage taken by 1%.
jerma you can do it i believe in you
do you know how to play the game?
Iâ€™m gonna go into the mirror world
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID THE SEXY POSE WAS BETTER THAN YOU KNOW
what about the time you showed otto on stream?
What do you think of the new Star Wars game?
Iâ€™m so glad youâ€™re playing this game
if you get hit, you have to go to the teleporter
you can use the chainsaw to instantly kill them
Just got back from the store, he's still here?
I bet you could make a better wine
Jerma when will you play Bloodborne with the new stream?
you
====================
Jerma
Just watch the whole game of tf2

you're the only person to play as a cat
You could have done that with your brother
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
it's gonna be the entire stream and we'll be here
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
I don't think you can do that
are you going to get the boots
you're gonna need it for the next one
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead :(
You can make your own character from scratch with this mod
why do you keep trying to kill me
You are a hobo, you have to learn how to cook
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaPluto jermaMars
jerma i just got here what the fuck is happening
You should do a Jerma death match
you have to do the T pose
do you think jerma will play the game on stream?
you're doing a great job! A GREAT JOB
i dont even know what that is LUL
you're just saying "it" and not "me"
can you please do a stream where you scream at chat?
do you want me to kill you with a knife
I got a gift sub and i still have no gift
try not to laugh at the joke
is this the ending to final fantasy
this is the worst shit ever, someone tell him
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
imagine being this bad at a game LUL
youre in the middle of a minecraft server
When are you going to play the Contra Hard Corps OST?
jerma we all know youre in this game
the second you talk about it, you're going to have a mental breakdown
this is what happens when you dont have friends
its only 3:50 in the morning why are you still here
You can make your own character from scratch with this mod
I was a student at the University of Toronto, but I only got my degree from the university, but I am a Canadian and can't post my answers on twitter.
it's not like you have to go anywhere to see a place
can you play the super mario rpg music?
I'm pretty sure that's a lot of health
Jerma you're the only one who's not good at this
this is why you have a terrible internet
do you have the game yet? Kappa
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
you're in the middle of a minecraft server, so you're not good at anything else LUL
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
you know the real winner is the one guy
jermaWalk ON MY WAY TO GET MY EGGS jermaWalk
You have to get all the ore from the river
you were talking about the same thing LUL
imagine how much money it would take to beat this
Jerma is a real life streamer, he canâ€™t be a fake game
i can't believe theres a fake mcdonalds employee in this
why do you have so many different prices LUL
why do you keep throwing these kids in
you need to put the toothpick on the wall
It's so obvious that you're not in a different game
If you leave your friends behind, they'll kill you.
are you going to play this for the entire stream?
jerma please play a game that is relaxing
this is like that shitty game where you jump off the edge of a building and die
The code on the right is your password
this is a fake game, you have no idea
you can make your own character from scratch with this mod
do you have any more plans to stream?
You guys are just jealous because you have no money
The only reason I'm in the US is to watch Jerma
youre the only one who can play a game
I will donate $2,000 if you play the DLC
====================
jermaPluto jermaJex2 otto is gone i don't know what happened
can you do the "I'm bad at this game" voice
i dont think jerma has ever actually played a game before
did he just say that he would play return of the king?
Please play some of the other cool games on the gamecube.
you can get the big fire
why are you not using your own face
this game is like playing a flash game
i'm just gonna say it, i've never had a good burger
i think that's where you get your shits
what's the best way to make a room?
It was the best part of the whole stream
why do you always play the same songs over and over again?
the only thing that makes this game good is how its so long
he was just trying to get into the toilet
I'm still waiting for the new Jerma Rumble
you are already a boomer, you should know that
is that a katana in the bottom right?
Are you gonna play the other FMV games?
you said you were gonna play Monster Rancher 2 tomorrow
how do you get a sponsorship with them
Hey @Jerma985, you're pretty cool. I'm glad you're playing this game.
you can do it I believe in you
i dont know what this is but its a good game
you can combine torches to make torches that are cheaper
you are going to die in the first hour
you're going to die in one hit
Jerma you gotta buy the other 4 for the rest of the game
Just use your tears and no one will notice
You can find more in the secret menu in the options.
did jerma actually make the clip he said he would play this game
can you do a speedrun of this please?
can you repeat what I said? I had to do it twice
This is like the last game you'll ever play
I can't believe Jerma is playing a REAL game
You can turn it off with the steam menu
you can just skip the tutorial and it'll go back to 0
It's because you have a C on your score.
You've been in a coma for 3 years.
You should play the Monster Rancher games
you can turn it off with the steam menu menu
Why is everyone complaining about Mario's controller? He's so short and compact
I hope jerma is enjoying the game and not being annoying
if you want to play some of the other games in the series, you should play the first one, the 2nd one is pretty bad
I wonder how many people are gonna be here for this
SourPls I have a feeling this is gonna be a good stream
you can go back and do it again
you're the only one who can make it
you need to go to the bathroom right now
you can turn it off with the steam menu menu
you can make the staff a permanent resident item
you need to play the second one
I miss the old Jerma who could play video games
it was good but the first one was a mess
did you see the new og ds
oh my god, this is like the show, you can do this
can you play the 2nd one, it's really good
That's the only way to play this game
no, it was the other way around
you can turn it off with the steam menu menu menu
if you go to the gas station and grab a soda just give it to her
YOU DONT HAVE TO BE STUCK IN THE MACHINES
jerma you have to buy the other 4
Dude you're gonna make me cry you're gonna make me cry
the game is a lot more fun than this
why does this guy have a griller hat on
why does the man in the bottom right look like a psycho
they have a whole new album of music
you can get the other 4 at the gas station
You were the only one that had to do it
you can turn it off with the steam menu menu
i can't believe jerma is fucking dead :(
You
====================
its a good thing you didnt die to pinwheel
this is a lot more fun than the other one
I'm gonna go get a good night sleep if he doesn't stream
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
i heard theres a burger king in vegas
I dont know what you mean, but he looks like a villain
I'm glad I missed out on a good stream
jermaPain just wanted to give you a heads up
You can get a few easy ones from the first level
He's trying to get the big gun and he's just getting a "good" one
You could have just said "That's how it is" and gotten it
this is a bad game, you know that
You should play a game with chat. Chat is boring to watch
Why do you look like a homeless person
this is like watching a 6 year old play a childrens game
please go to the bathroom I need to pee
no one will know how much you spent on this
why are you so out of place
jermaOld I remember when Jerma used to stream
i was just watching your stream and I'm confused by this
I'm too lazy to get to the stream
this is the worst game you've ever played
you should play the actual game it's just great
I thought you said you were gonna play Ace Attorney tomorrow
"I'm just gonna go back to my house"
I think this game is gonna be a fucking disaster
remember when you said you'd never play an anime game
just put a bunch of stuff on the floor to make it seem more impressive
You should play Chrono Trigger OST https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7U2hF-X4U
The people that played this game were the worst
how the hell did you know that, jerma?
this game is made for children this is for adults
are you going to play the sequel?
if you die to pinwheel you die in real life
this is the best stream of 2019
I'm gonna go watch the vod, thanks for the laughs jermaHeart
I'm still waiting for the green screen stream
Jerma is going to come into chat and say "I'm going to beat this level"
dont forget to check the logs on the left
you can make anything taste good with a fork
so much to do so much to see
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE RAT LEVEL
This is just a big castle, you're just gonna be a small peasant
you have to be in the middle of a village
I am so sad I missed the stream jermaPluto
I don't think this game is for you
this is the best game in the game
you can't just make the game your own, you'll get sued for this shit
hey, what's your opinion of black and white 2
You can just get it for free on Steam
you can tell it's not a joke when it's "so boring"
I'm glad Jerma didn't have to listen to the voices
he can't even say it on stream anymore
how many times have you done this
youre gonna need to do the first level
He has a bag of chips in his backpack
oh my god i'm so glad i was here
Why are you giving away your personal information
you can always send me the link in chat
how did you manage to make that sound
You're in a coma, please wake up
i think you have to use the elevator to get up
the only way to win is not to play
"im not gonna lie, im gonna be so pissed if i dont get the gold coin"
jerma how much do you wanna bet that you won't?
that's what happens when you put all your eggs on the right side
i don't know how to tell what's jerma talking about
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE OTHER WOMAN
you can't play the game for more than 2 hours
I can't believe Jerma was born with a bionic arm, that's why he's not in the next rumble
I just want to see the guy who beat dark souls on stream
jerma is mad and he's talking about his poop
you should be banned from every game ever
It's time for you to watch
====================
I've been subbed to Jerma for like 6 months. I'm so happy to be in his stream
try to keep it to yourself and keep the joke
it's true, the game was rigged from the start
I think you need to use a different controller
you can use the ladder to walk on it
I see you have a lot of money
its gonna be a vod later this week
hey chat, did he beat the final boss yet?
How much did you pay for this?
i would've been fine with you streaming, but I'm sure you'd like it
the real Jerma died on the 23rd of january 2019
why are you playing this game its so boring
jerma you can't beat this game, you can't beat this game
how many of these are you going to play?
Jerma is gonna be the only one to die
your build is gonna be so good
I can't believe you didn't finish Sam & Max
I was just trying to tell you that I'm an American
Why is the font so much darker than the game
What's your favorite game to play on your stream?
You can't be a teacher without being a fucking boomer
If you want a good pizza, go to Pizza Hut and order a Pizza
I miss the old Jerma that would just sit on the computer for 5 hours and pretend to be chat
i love how you just keep saying "i'm sorry"
oh my god he's still playing this game
It's like a movie where the director gets scared by the camera
Jerma I'm a new viewer and you're just ruining my day
you should play The Undertaker's Revenge
you can make a new character in the sewer level
I'm sorry for being late, it was an awful joke
why are you playing this game? This is so boring
You can pay money to beat the game, but you have to beat the game first
didnt you say you were gonna play sam and max
do a stream of the actual movie
Jerma, I'm trying to say thanks for the years of entertainment, but I'm also really upset because I didn't get to catch the end of the stream.
you can go into the sewer level with the shovel
you have to make the town look like an actual town
I think it's because you haven't been paying attention to the game
you're a fucking sociopath and you're going to jail
you can't actually die to pinwheel, it's a glitch
you can use the ladder to walk on it
is it because you don't know how to use the axe?
YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE DLC
You have to use the ladder to walk on it
what's this "shpee" guy talking about LUL
Jerma I think you need to change the game to FAST ENOUGH
you can change the difficulty in the menu
Jerma the voice actor in this game is just so bad at this game
what if you tried to fight the dragon
i think you need to have a doctor
you have to use the ladder to walk on it
You can also do it with the shovel
you can use the ladder to walk on it
DUDE IT'S THE SAME GUY AS THE POLICE
I can't believe he's gonna be late
do you want to see a map of this area
you need to make the towns population smaller
i'm pretty sure he is using it for a joke
you can go into the sewer level with the shovel
this game is just like the big rat
this is literally just the whole game, and you're playing it in an arcade

Are you gonna play Dead Rising 2?
You need to click the link in the top left
Can you put the top of the house next to the wall
When you beat the game it's time for your bedtime
go to the town and talk to the old lady
he doesn't know how to use the bow
you have to pick up the thing
YOU HAVE TO SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD
The animations for this game are so good
do you really think your jokes are funnier than the actual game?
this is the most generic song in the game
jerma just realized that he doesn't have a penis
I think this is the worst movie ever made
I'm so sorry for your loss, you're the only person I've ever heard of who could do this
you can do it to the people in the first game
so you're saying you'd watch it on stream?
you're the one that gets things done around here
why are you always pretending to be bad
you know you need to be more aggressive when you're getting into the air
I'd be so glad if you played that
You need to be taller to beat the game
that's the most depressing thing I've ever heard you say
what the fuck is that, i love it
THEY HATED HIM SO MUCH HE SAID IT
you can save and load the save files
The sound effects in this game are so good

this is just the dark souls of football
What's the status on that one, I don't understand
is that the guy from the speed run?
i cant believe jerma is doing the same thing over and over again
theres a lot of bugs to play through
you can find the music in the menu
Why would you go to a restaurant and not serve the food
theres a mod that adds the special buff to summoners
it's not a bug it's a glitch
you can just buy them at the store
this game is pretty fucking boring, I'm glad you're playing it
jerma can you please not play this game anymore please
theres a mod that makes it so that you can turn off the HUD and just have a little ding ding sound to it
what do you do in the morning?
you have to be at least 5'6 to play this game
It's a little on the nose, I'm not sure why
Did you know you can drink soda with a straw?
this is what you get for not paying attention to the game
you can use it in the menu for the quest
have you ever played the new sonic adventure?

i have no idea what this is but i love it
you can get a free ipod nano for $2
you can make a really good burger right now
You don't need to do this to progress
you need a bed to sleep to sleep
Would you consider playing the new Animal Crossing?
you know i was gonna do a third one
how much of the game is left? LUL
i was here for the last hour and a half
the only one i know is the real one
so this is how you started the stream
I think you can put them in the box
If you like this game so much why don't you play more metal gear solid?
I just got here, what the fuck is happening?
can you do the minecraft soundboard joke again?
please do it for the ending music
I think you need to make sure to save some money for the new class.
I love how the game is just a massive blackboard with a bunch of random numbers
theres no way youre going to beat the first part
it's not a bug, it's a controller issue
why do you look like a boss?
YOU NEED TO DIE TO GET THE MONEY
they don't call him short enough for them to have the appropriate name
you've been playing this for an hour and a half
why does this game have a mobile game mode
you can do it again on the next stream
it's like 2am here, why do you have to be late?
can you play the game please :)
You are not a real gamer. you are a meme gamer.
you can't even tell what a car is
I will try and explain myself, but I'll have to go through the whole game
just make a new account and have it auto-deleted
I was trying to make a joke and got a text from a friend and then ended up with a message from him and it was a bunch of bs
That's why I always come home late, I have to make sure I have enough time to get back to work jermaPluto
he's gonna be live in like 2 hours
I don't know what you're talking about, but it's pretty funny
I think you need to make sure you have enough money to buy the new set of clothes
Jerma, you can't just say the word "bad"
you can make a really good burger right now
i'm here because i am a pleb :)
you can just start over and save every so often, theres a cheat
you can use it on the blacksmith in the middle of the dungeon
If you die in the game, you die in real life
its not a bug, its a glitch
You are doing a good job of making all these characters happy
You have to get rid of all of them
i hope jerma doesnt get a copy of the game
im glad you're enjoying my rn :)
why is there a jerma rumble in this game
I'm glad I got to watch this stream
you can't just say "jesus" and not "suck a fart"
you're supposed to be talking to the doctor
you know what they say about a man with big hands
I just got here, why is the streamer playing an anime game?
you have to save everyone in the last hour
That was the most unprofessional thing I've ever seen
If you don't get the boots you won't get the boots
why do they have the same dog as you?
you know what else is a bad joke
you have to find the gold coin
i can't wait for the stream to start :)
jerma please i have a flu and it's killing me
they'll be able to pay for a new room
The dreamcast version is a little bit better.
i'm only gonna do this for like 2 hours
why is he so sweaty in this game
he's trying to make the best money, and he's failing horribly
Hes going to be in this movie for the next two hours
how is
====================
why is jerma's face so much darker than my friend's
i hope he gets to the pikachu socks
what the fuck is going on in this game
i love how everyone is talking about the game and i'm like "whats this?"
HOLY SHIT I'M A BRUH. I'M GONNA SMASH THIS GUY'S ASS OFF
Do you think you'll ever play Persona 5?
i like how it sounds like he's doing a walkthrough
You can hear the panic in his voice
you're not gonna win the war, stop being dumb
that's the only way i can watch you jermaHeart
it's the final boss of the game and he's so good
I think they put a lot of effort into it
You have to complete all the missions to get the secret ending
Iâ€™m gonna be honest, this is the worst ive ever seen Jermaâ€™s stream
Hey guys, just got here. Is he doing the cooking stream again?
jermaOld I remember when you couldn't click on the map
Jerma you are a wonderful person and I am very proud of you
you have a bath in the bottom right
There's a random boss in this game
theres a save file for that
you can do this with the gameboy advance
Theres a secret ending if you fail
he has the same voice as when he was in a timeloop game LUL
You're playing as a literal child right now
do you have the game audio ready
It's an auto clicker, just like a real clicker
I just got here and I see this
I just got back and I'm already crying
he was already in the top of the tower
this is why you're not in the next rumble
can you turn up the music so i can hear the bop
I'm glad you're playing this game :)
Jerma is the best streamer on Twitch, everyone else is
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEING LATE, BUT YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT TICKETS
if you stand in the middle of the room and place a block above it it will block all of the blocks
Jerma is too busy writing the truth to stream
jerma youre going to get killed by a car
jerma why is your stream so quiet I can hear the game audio
you don't need to buy anything just get the boots
you have to play the game and put it back in
I'm going to burn my house down and you'll never see me again
He was just at the top of the tower
it's because you are having a good time
can you do the pepega voice again
you're gonna get banned for that one
this is a lot of stuff in one place
this game is so cool and everything is fun and amazing
you don't even need to get the boots
i thought he was gonna say hed be doing a talk to transformer stream
I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who thinks this is fun
if you dont have a mouse then you don't need one
You should play the game with the boots
just like the game that was supposed to be a mystery
you have to find the secret room first
this is a joke you are making
"why are you wearing a backpack" -jerma
are you going to play the new Animal Crossing when it comes out?
jerma is only playing this because he likes it
you have to get it on steam
no one wants to see your bad photo
the red stuff on the right side
put in the dog food it's the same thing
you got the nunchuck on your first try
the "left" one is for the secret room
its because you don't have a mouse
they were talking about the little girl and you picked up a gun
you should try to find a save file for the secret room
you can make anything you want in dreams
you have to find the secret room first
you can make anything you want in dreams
You can't make the wii version of Mario
@
====================
imagine if you had to make the same joke over and over again
and you're telling me jerma is doing the same thing over and over again
you should be able to leave the server
are you going to play the new nancy drew game?
i've been here for like 15 minutes now
HE JUMPS OFF THE TRAILER AND DOWN TO THE ICE BELOW
I'm not going to lie, this looks pretty fun
the level ends when you get the boots
how do you feel about the fact that you don't have a wii?
I hope Jerma gets a twitch staff role :)
You can buy tickets in the game
I just got here and I already know what the fuck is going on
it's like a 30 degree turn on the light
i just want jerma to say the n word
you are going to be banned from twitch for life
you need to use the other things for the door
I think you can get through this one
when are you going to play the simpsons hit and run?
I like this game but I would rather watch you play it on stream
i think he has the same voice actor as gandalf
I have to go to bed please help
Oh my god I've been watching you since the tf2 days
The final level is a long one
i was just thinking about your stream
you need to play a lot of good games to find the one that works for you
Oh yeah I saw you were playing this in the store.
What the hell is wrong with this guy?
I'm going to go watch the VOD, see you in a couple hours
you can't do that in real life, it's dangerous
I feel bad for the people that have to keep replaying these levels
jerma why are you playing a porn game?
you can do it but you have to be fucking stupid
it's the same game from the beginning
It's a good thing you didn't get any xp
YOURE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
i hope you guys know i've been watching this stream for about 4 hours and he's still not done with it
jermaPluto Jerma's gonna have to move to a better house
the real end of the stream was when he made the pee joke
how much do i have to pay you to not stream
Do you have any plans to play more resident evil 2?
you could have just played all the fucking games
You can get the boots in the shop
I'm sorry Jerma, I'll be back in a moment.
do you have any idea how much you can get in the game?
I'm back, why did you leave me alone jermaPluto
can you turn the music down a bit?
you can go into the other building
you can use your light to see the stars
theres a mod that adds a crosshair to the bottom left
you can make your own custom game with this
I hate this game so much, the music is so good
If you're so smart, why don't you just play the game
I'm gonna go eat dinner now, thanks for the stream
how about you turn the game off and play the game
make it a no funny joke please
this game is just a training dummy
you're like a toddler playing with a toy gun
JERMA MY DAD IS DEAD IM GONNA POG
I can't believe you've been playing this game for an hour
you can do it! you're the only one who can!
you have to do it with the same character
I'm a man of my word, you can do anything with me
if you're going to make it on your own, you should do it with a different character
You know this is a real game right?
the game doesn't have a sound, it just has a timer
theyre just in the game to be fair
if you're not happy with a game why are you playing it
the game will be worth the money
is this the guy who beat the game on stream?
you know what you dont need to do
This is the best part of the game
what if you
====================
it's a fucking clusterfuck of a game, it's really fun
I have the same problem, it's a race car problem
I cant believe the voice actor for a manlet was a substitute teacher
you are an hour early, time to leave
just try to find a town with an entrance to it
he's gonna spend the whole stream on this
if you die in the game you die for real
You have to turn the music down to 0%
jermaWalk i wish i could do the same
you are making me want to watch this
I love that they just make up a bunch of numbers
The first time I heard that you had a life and you were just a robot.
You can play as the other characters, they're just not as good
i'm out of the loop on the jerma rumble
You could have used the free upgrade that lets you summon skeletons
If you don't beat this game I'm gonna fucking puke
you dont need to be in the game
i love how the vod is just the same stream
why does jerma look like he has a gamer neck
this is like a fever dream but jerma is actually a god
I want to see him get his ass kicked
can you do a normal voice with the voice changer?
jerma you need to have a walkthrough of this game
He's just gonna say "OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO SMART!"
you can't die if you don't die in the game
you have to buy the blueprints, theyre free
i am going to say the n word
I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kinda excited for this
I don't think the devs knew what was happening
I have a feeling you don't want to watch this but I don't think you'd like it.
you can make an even bigger house
when is the next green screen stream?
I think you should do a bit where you get a lot of new friends, like with Mr. Bean
jerma can you play another game please i need to watch this one
there's a reason we don't have music - it's not like we have anything else
i was gonna say you're a good person but i got the wrong impression
you're doing great Jerma, keep it up and keep it up
this is like the greatest speedrun of all time
i'm going to fucking scream at the screen
I bet you could beat it with the sun
you can do it in real life
oh god i have a fake ipad in my room
i would love to see him play mario kart
I've been here for 2 hours, you're still here?
so are you doing another 24 hours stream
you can only do that in real life
just take it to the bank and give it to the bank
why does everyone in chat hate this game
YOU CAN'T GET UP THERE, YOU'RE IN A COMBINE
Jerma is gonna die from a heart attack jermaPluto
oh shit, the thing from the game, it's just a zombie
jermaSun STREAMER DOESN'T KNOW THE VALUE OF HIS MONEY
You can do a face cam stream with a bunch of people
You should really buy a 2nd controller LUL
If you want to watch the movie, you need to watch the movie
jermaOld when will you play the part where you die?
I'm here for the chat not the stream
this game is just like, a banger
I'm pretty sure they were supposed to make the movie for this game
I can't believe Jerma got the coronavirus. He's like 40% through and doesn't have much time left
what if they're all just saying a swear word
I'm not sure why, but I have no clue
this is what happens when you don't do the tutorial
theres a huge difference between the two streams
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
You need to find the secret room in the safe room
just do a poll so people can pick
I think it would be nice if we could actually make a stream like this
Are you going to play Forma next stream?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
@Jerma
====================
You can just do it for the rest of the game
we just wanna hear the song so much
he did it on the first try! you had to
you can make your own wedding in this game
Can you do the exact same thing with the bowl of soup?
JERMA THE DOG IS IN THE CLOSET NotLikeThis
That's the only way you can have fun
play the game on the gameboy advance :)
You should play the dlc for this game, it's really good
imagine the doomsday scenario where we are all having a fucking meltdown because you can't get past the first boss
jermaOld I remember when I used to watch your streamer streams jermaOld
i don't even know what that is, I'm just looking for a reference
How many channel points for you to turn on the webcam
We're gonna get a tf2 video game
you should make a full stream of this game
hey guys, what the fuck is going on

I miss the old Jerma that would beat his meat with his feet
What is this "Jerma" shit? I expect something better next time.
you are a good boy jermaHeart jermaHeart
jerma is gonna be a bad guy jermaPluto
You can upgrade the vault to a fully upgraded one
Dude I just got back, why is he in the same spot?
This is how you get people to stop donating
jerma doesn't even know what a moutain is
can you please put on the Japanese version of any of the songs in the game
you are gonna have to play it again
there's a good chance you can get a new key
I'm so glad he's playing this game.
this is the most annoying part of this game
You're like a dog trapped in a cage
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
You should try to beat the boss, it's harder than this
i think you got the wrong door
You have to get the white key
I think you need to go to the main menu
you can get the bad ending on the alternate ending
how many of you guys are actually furries?
he's just a little dumb for a moment
is this the streamer who lost to pinwheel?
You can make your own wedding in this game
Theres a secret in the closet of the tree

jerma you have to go to the building next to the ladder
you can get a new key for the next level
you can get a key for the next level
You have to equip the first item first
Play the game, you are a great entertainer <3
i cant believe you're still playing this game
i think you got the wrong door
youre supposed to get the real ending there
That's how you get the good ending
The thing is, you don't know how to play the game
this is like the end of the game
You can't even tell the story of it
you can make your own wedding in this game
why is the cow so shit at this game
Why does the music in this game sound like you're playing an alarm clock
if you use the arrow keys it lets you scroll up
How can you be so bad at this game?
you can make your own wedding in this game
they just want to be left alone. it's not even an option

they put the water in a bathtub to drown them
why is he doing the voice changer again
Jerma is so bad at this game LUL
I think you need to click the thing in the bottom right
He said he was going to play something else

Is this the guy that lost to Pinwheel?
JERMA YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE GAME ONCE
I'm trying to imagine the mods are actually there to do anything

you need to play the gta iv first
I'm gonna die in a week from this
Why is the game so fast paced? LUL

jermaPluto jermaHeart jermaHeart jermaHeart jermaPluto jermaHeart jermaTV jermaVenus jermaTV
i love how this game is so much more entertaining than the actual game
i dont know how to do this, i just want to watch the game
i have no idea how you could do that
I can't wait for Jerma to be late in 3 minutes
i think i got a twitch gift sub too
if you think your streams are funny, you should go watch one of your vids
theres a song from the original mario maker that is good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtE-0cgfQZI

i feel bad for jerma now jermaPluto jermaPluto
this game is like, the worst thing ive ever seen
i want to play this game but my phone doesn't work
I thought you were gonna go into the kitchen and eat some food
if jerma shows up in 15 minutes i will go insane
He's gonna put a fucking coin in his mouth
why does it look like he's in the middle of the room
This is a reference to the thing from Powerpoint
this is the first stream i've ever watched and I've been really into it
this is the only way to go
chat has been saying this for hours now
It's like that one scene from The Thing
you can't stream but you can watch someone else's stream
if you don't beat this you're a furry
he has to play the game for him
I'm back is jerma still playing this game
The other one is the same but in a different color
"I'm not going to do that, I'm going to watch the movie, don't try it."
you should do a live rumble in the rumble
Jerma do you want to know how I got these scars?
I wish jerma would show up and say he was having a good day jermaPluto
THE REASON YOU'RE NOT ON THE TOP RULES IS YOU'RE IN A ROOM WITH A STREAMER
You can do this in every game you play
I'm just going to say it. That game is so good.
i dont think its a good idea to just have a small group of people doing a backflip
you have to stop pretending and do it
I can't believe Jerma is a fucking mental midget
I can't believe Jerma lied about taking a break
You have to do it for the secret ending
I can't believe Jerma is a mental midget
You're not even halfway through the game.
You should get a BetterTTV for that one
Have you played a game in the past?
jermaVenus I'VE BEEN HERE FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES

i think you can just keep moving
you can make a custom emote, it's called "JERMA"
you got a bad rep from the ISP
"i'm not gonna make it" - Jerma
i think the only reason you have so many subs is because you are in the wrong chat
you can also jump and shoot with the axe

I was here for the first time yesterday
I just got here, what happened
jerma has like 2 other friends on the same server
when you die in the game you die for real
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
you have to make a good joke
You can open the menu to see how long it takes
i bet they are playing with the alien
Do you have the green screen footage?
It's like they're making a movie for you
Jerma, you're not supposed to use the bathroom in this game

I have a feeling Jerma is a 9 year old
jerma you can't just say "hey" and have it be the beginning of a message
are you gonna do the muppets ride
what if you got out of the water?
the actual game isn't so bad, it's just that it's so bad that it's worth it.

I just got here, what the fuck is happening
i hate how jerma can only afford 1 meal a day
theres a giant one on the right

try clicking on the green screen thing
Play the game. I can't believe you bought it
you missed the secret boss in the main menu
I mean, that's what you get for playing a video game
This is the worst stream I've ever watched
do you know that the ring is a secret?
You've been in a coma for almost 2 years. Please wake up
you have to get out of the water
this is the worst stream of the year
I'm still sad that you can't play this game anymore
can't believe this streamer is a fake fan
I hope he plays the DLC for Sekiro
I'm going to leave for my own good.
you can buy a new car from the vending machine
they are not even in the same room
they're just trying to get you to quit
he looks like a house of cards character
It's a game for 8 year olds

You need to turn the lights off
You have to go to the other side
You have to get the polearm and grab the staff

Go to the sewer and swim there

Hey , I know it's not that big of a deal but I have to admit I'm really bummed that you're not playing this right now
imagine if this was the game you were playing
I'm not sure if this is going to be a funny stream
jerma is just a dude who never eats food
you're not going to get a coin, you're gonna get one from a special event
i just got here, why is jerma playing a game he hates

I dont think this is how it works
Jerma I'm having a heart attack, and my doctor says the only cure is for me to shit my pants within the next 5 minutes. I'm severely constipated. I don't want to die. Please help me.
I don't know why Jerma doesn't just put it in a tier
I'm in the middle of the ocean, and I can feel the waves
I like how this is the only time we get to see jerma in person
I was just listening to a vod and saw the same thing.

chat is just so bad at making jokes that they have to make up for themselves
you have to get the boots first
you need to get the boots first

theres a huge gap between the 2nd and 3rd floors
this is the worst thing i have ever seen
That's not a fucking knife. That's a fucking knife.
JERMA THE BEGINNING OF THE STREAM IS
====================
 to you right now?
i just got here, how is this game?
jerma this game is like a horror game
I'll be honest, I don't know what the fuck is going on
have you ever heard of a series called "Dead Rising"
jermaDisgust how long has he been live? i'm not sure
you can use the portal to get to the other side
Please turn the sound down, it's getting to my ears.
if jerma doesn't show up RIGHT NOW I'm gonna SCREAM
jermaSun I'm gonna make a mod for this chat
How does Jerma not have a home depot yet?
yeah, just put a little something in the middle
You can still do a decent bit later
dont forget to wear your gamer license :)
why does he look like a 5 year old
That was an absolute scammed joke at this point
I'm getting a headache from this game LUL
this is gonna be a disaster LUL
Hey Jerma, can you say â€œyesâ€ for me?
They used to have a lot of fun
You were supposed to be in the star wars movie, not the movie
JERMA I'M SO HAPPY I'M HERE FOR THE STREAM
Is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
i wish i had an excuse to hang out with my friend :(
he's not even here. he's just on a bunch of other chats
jerma i want you to buy this game
Hey, I've been watching your streams, can you please play this game?
can you get the real ending in the last level
just go to the closest tavern and buy a bunch of potions
I'm back, did Jerma beat the whole game?
I can't believe Jerma thinks he's the best streamer on Twitch
You're gonna get timed out for saying the word bald.
You're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOOB!
chat theres a really good comic by the way
you can make a ham and cheese sandwich with it
he doesnt know what a kidney is OMEGALUL
Jerma I'm a mommy why are you doing this to me
jerma i just got here can you please pause the game
you should've said you're playing this on the original xbox
its been a year and hes STILL on the main menu LUL
you should do a cooking stream on the second floor
jerma is a chad i should know jermaJex
you know you can change the color of your skin?
I wish Jerma would stop bullying my wife :(
just play the game instead of clicking the notification bell
I bet Jerma is gonna do that with his mouth
If you kill all the demons in the beginning you get a special item
i can't believe jerma is actually a human
they were trying to buy the license for this game
i will make a mod for this chat
Jerma, do you have a clip of you saying that you were a real boy?
jermaDisgust POG GAMES WERE MY FAVORITE POG GAMES
it's not even like it's fun, it's just a bad game
I wish Jerma would play this game more often
why did you have to call him a boomer
please go to the tavern and buy some potions
HES GONNA PLAY THIS FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS
can you just put the ball on the field?
jerma i love you and your streams always make me laugh
I think Jerma needs a new monitor for this game
i hope he's not playing that shitty game again LUL
You can go to the tavern and buy a bunch of potions
This is how you get to the top of a building
i think there was a secret boss in this game
he's not gonna beat the first part of Fellowship
you can just cut it in half and use the other side
i cant believe you got banned for saying the n word
is this the guy that got gold in the snow?
What would you rate this game out of 10
i want to see the vod too
have you considered playing the new Animal Crossing?
i want to see your face right now
if you have no other friends, you're a boomer
Jerma just show us the funko pops you have on
====================
you know, just like the old days of video games
it's not a game its a virus, it's just a virus
that is why you play it, but not the game
You got the coin, you got the coin
oh man, I hate the new emotes, they look like the old ones
it's the same song over and over again
I'm going to leave and come back to this
i just got here what is this emote
how about a game with a shitty premise?
can't wait for the next jerma rumble when theres only 3 players
The only way to make it work is to have a bad game :)
Have you ever played the old metal gear games?
I really hope he's not as high as he used to be
you can check the cams by pressing CTRL + G
You can just press the menu button at the bottom of the screen
hey guys does anyone have a clip of the last time he was in chat
yeah the stream is going to be tomorrow
you're about to make a classic jerma stream
do you have a clip of the last time you streamed?
I'm not sure if you're talking about this game or if you're talking about this game.
i dont know what he's talking about but I think it's "go to bed"
i don't know what you're talking about, but i like that
There's a game called "Dusk" it's really good
I can't believe Jerma is STILL playing this
i hate it, i'm going to eat my own shit
you were supposed to eat the ghost pepper
how do you feel about the "end of stream voice" joke?
I just got here, why is your mic so quiet?
you need to do a shorter run of it
you gotta find the true ending to get the end of stream voice
jerma you're the best streamer on twitch :)
I think you're gonna die of old age
I'm so glad I joined the stream today.
Jerma it's like a 4-5 hour game, it's about the same length as the first one
you can't just play with people who want to buy the same game, just buy the same game
You are a good guy, thank you for your service
so what you're saying is that this game is boring
LUL it was a good joke, good job jerma
you can check the cams by pressing CTRL + G
you're like the dumbest streamer on twitch right now
will you be playing any of the new games tonight?
you can get a lot of items in this game
You are the only one who can save us
why would you have a colonoscopy
i'm on the edge of my seat
you know what would be a great stream
you gotta go back to the one where you started the game
I got here late but I was just about to finish watching the vod
we have to do it to the end
He was a serial killer before he went to jail
i can't believe jerma just fucking died on stream
I'm glad you're playing this, I loved the stream
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who sees that
you can get a lot of items in this game
this is what the game's creators were thinking
you have to do it with the ship
i'm here to see you fail at this
get some water, it helps with that
i think that was a joke but it was fake
this game is just a childrens book LUL
I dont like the audio of that lady screaming
when are you gonna do the green screen stream
He has a crush on you Jerma :(
theres a game called "The Movies" it's really good
you should try to get a gun, it can be really good
i feel like i'm in a dark souls game
You can only use the teleporter to teleport
you can get a lot of items in this game
imagine not being able to drink at all LUL
why is this game so good and not good at all
that is the saddest face on earth
when are you gonna play the super paper mario?
Hey can you
====================
this game is like 3 hours long and its fucking boring
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
It's not a porn game, it's a joke
you can buy a new computer for 20 bucks
If you want to see the rest of the game, you have to beat the game first.
you have to finish it now, you're done :)
You can only do so much in a row
jerma, if you were to stream yourself eating a shoe on stream, would you do it?
why did you say you'd play Sam and Max again
I'm going to make a jup. Don't worry.
it's not a joke, it's a fact
What if we kissed in the bathroom today? ðŸ˜³
why is he not playing the game already?
you are the only streamer I've ever been able to watch live
you can buy a new computer for 20 bucks
i hate the part where they did a fake jerma joke
you can keep your dog or pet as a friend
you should probably play the first game
I'm gonna be honest, this is the least relaxing thing you've done all stream
just imagine how you'd be doing with a virtual machine
I don't know what's going on in this game
i just got here what the fuck is happening
i feel like im in a fever dream
why does jerma always have a bad haircut
jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus
Jerma you should be the one to do it
jerma you're a gamer, go to bed or I'll break my keyboard
it's a real jerma stream, he's just trying to make us happy
jerma is going to come in here and say "why isnt he here"
when is the next FTK stream? i want to know!

i wish jerma would play more of these games
You can get the full game for $60 on steam right now
I think you can go to any store
jerma, i have a feeling you're not gonna beat this part of the game
i think they were the only two that said it

You can also find it on the map
i'm gonna come back in 2 hours and say i'm sorry
you can buy a new computer for 20 bucks
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who loves this game.
you have to go into the main menu and select "Show Desktop"
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
it was the best thing about the game
its not the "game" its the game
your mic is clipping with your voice
I'm back, did Jerma get the door open yet?
Jerma is a furry and we're just jealous
this is the most awful thing ive ever seen
YOU DIDN'T SAID YOU WOULD PLAY THIS
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
Please do a stream of the game you are playing, so you can play it
Jerma just pretend you're playing a video game and get money
you are the only streamer I've watched play this game
i cant believe jerma is a furry jermaPluto

you can use the 'up' and 'down' buttons on the controller
you have to do the blue and red stuff
i dont know why they did it but it is

you have to kill the dragon with the sword
Is this the streamer that was late to streams?
can you play the Hotline Miami 2 OST please?

but you can still do it in the dark
it's not about the money, it's about how you make it
you should play the game with a controller

You could be making this up as you go along
please go back to the game, you missed the "escape room" one
it's not the same for everyone but it's like 2-3x the difficulty
the audio is going too fast for you
have you heard of the thing? :)
is this the streamer that won the blue ribbon?
Is this the streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, thanks! :)
you can just throw rocks at them and they'll get you
jerma is the only one with the money
Theres a secret boss in the main menu
how do you even beat the game without using the sword
just do it right now and you'll be fine

I'm back! Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
You have to get to the other side of the building
I'm so glad I'm not the only one that hears this sound
You need to go to the other side of the bridge
you can get a lot of stuff from that
YOU HAVE TO USE THE OTHER TWO TO GET THE CUTSCENE
i have a clip of you saying "i hate this guy"
I have a friend who's like 8 hours behind and hasnt watched a stream in a while
The real question is why are you still playing this game
if you were to find a better game, would you choose that over any other one?
play the level "Where is the Hulk?"
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1878. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I'm gonna go to bed, I'm tired of this fucking game
YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE OTHER ROOM
that's why you had a bad relationship with Brad, he has bad taste
just keep trying to find the key to the other room
that's why you are doing so well with the dlc
you can move the other side of the bridge
can you do the gitaroo man voice
I just got back from dinner, is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?

I can't believe I missed the last hour of this stream
we're gonna be here for 15 years jermaPluto
how do you know what a mule is
The Wii had an easier time than the PS1
the best part of this game is when you get the boots
it's a lot more fun than the first one
you're the only one that gets to do it
is this the streamer who did an ultrasound on stream?
I'm in the mood for some real crack right now
i think this game is about 10 times better than dark souls
That's how you know they're in the game.

LUL the audio is so good for a modded game
I'm glad we're all having a good time tonight jermaHeart
he's still playing the first game guys. I'm so excited
if you dont like that song you dont get to play it

jermaFireman_RD Fireman is the best emote in the game
You gotta do more stuff on the ground
Jerma I'm back, what did I miss?

You can put a woodchuck in there if you want
You can use the campfire to do the next town hall
Jerma can you please play the Contra Hard Corps OST please
we're gonna see a lot of this game
It's just like the first game in the series.
I'm really glad you're playing this game. I just wish you had a good time with chat and getting to the end.
you need to turn off the game music
I just realized this is just the guy from the intro
you can do a backflip, i've got that for you
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DREW CREW
jerma's going to die from the sugar rush
we need to tell you about the fucking gnome
how are you still in the sewer?
you can actually get a better item
you can just leave the game and come back
are you going to play the new dlc
I'm just gonna say this, if you're good
====================
The only time you can do it is in a real game
can you do the voice for a second
it's a 90s movie, you can't say "lmao"
I think you have to give the girl a hug
I love how Jerma is just standing in the middle of the street with his feet in the air
if only the boots didn't make you feel like shit
LUL I'm not sure how much longer he's going to be streaming this time
what if there's a door that leads out of the closet
Why are you wearing a backpack when you can just walk up and grab a gun
you've been doing this for an hour jerma
get the other four to make a better rat level
why are you still playing this game LUL
oh my god jerma is gonna lose it
This is the best stream of the year
you can eat the hot chip if you're hungry
you can get the other four
oh i get it. you're a funny man
this is the most boring thing ever
I've been gone for like 2 hours and you're still here
Do you know if you can get a sub for us?
if you didn't have to do the tutorials you'd be a better gamer
Jerma you need to play this for 10 hours
that's a very long hair break for a twitch streamer
You can tell he's just a manlet because he's wearing a backpack
This is what you get for not giving him a sub
why is the color green in this game?
what if they were a single child who had two parents and had to play this game
theres a third one, you can buy them for free
if you're having fun just play it
you can keep it in your inventory, you don't need to unlock it
Is this game like the PC version of CS?
you can buy it for free with twitch prime
How do you not know how to play this game
it's not an anime game, it's a real game
i can't believe jerma is watching his own stream jermaPluto
just a day or two before the stream starts
you can get the other four
When are you going to play Wreck-It Ralph?
He's going to die in the first hour
I'm pretty sure that's the only way to get a sub
it's a shame he didn't finish that game
you can get a katana for a penny in the shop
The only thing I know about Jerma is that he's a redditor
theres a game called "The Thing" it's pretty good
why is your character looking like a clown
its a kids game its all in the name
you can get the other four in the secret
you can get the other four in the secret
I'm still waiting for the Jerma986 stream to happen

you can buy it for free with twitch prime
you can't tell me what to do jermaSun
this game is so good at the same time
why is there a penis on this game?
you just need to know the truth
I can't believe Jerma's playing a game that doesn't have a proper soundtrack.
i bet he played this as a kid
put the paper on the wall so they dont see it
if you turn it on you can make your own weapon
have you tried going back to the main menu?
I bet you have to get a new phone everytime you use a phone
Why does this game have an anime girl in it?
I bet you can't even beat the first level of this game
How many games did you play before you became a mod?
I think you can do a hit and run with this
i think you can play this for a few hours
you need to make the boat out of water
you can get the other four in
====================
I don't think the devs ever played this game
you can say "I love this game" but you can also say "I hate this game"
LUL this is just a game that jerma hates
I'm the developer of this game, please do the voices
can you take the audio out of the game?
JERMA IS A PSYCHO AND WILL NEVER PLAY PSYCHOPATH
you just reminded me of my favorite streamer
the game is just about to start, you have to play it
i miss when jerma wasnt a youtube streamer
you need to use the rocks to get to the end of the level
do you have a book with a picture of you on it?
You should play the new strategy game from Activision
i dont think this is a good game
you dont have to eat the shoe to eat it
I have to watch this with my family tomorrow
you know what is funny? being annoyed by Jerma
you can look it up on youtube
Jerma is so bad at this game LUL
I don't know if he's even using the ring yet
he was trying to get a free one
youre still playing this game? get the fuck out of here
You're not even paying attention, you're just messing around
i'm gonna go buy a jerma drink while I wait
you have to pay the troll toll to get in the car
I'm pretty sure you know how to play this game right
I don't know if I can watch this stream without hearing your voice
i am so disappointed in you, you have been playing this game for 20 hours
It's not a stream, it's a video
I'm not sure if you need it or not
I'm going to try to make a joke
You're already a top 5 streamer, stop pretending
i think you're the best at that game
I'm playing Sam & Max and I'm confused
you can look it up, and watch the entire thing on youtube
what is the deal with the middle of the screen being dark?
i think you can only go to the center of the planet
theres a lot of stuff in this game
This is my first stream and I am very excited for this stream
It's like you're actually a child playing with a controller
Hey jerma, would you like to play a game?
i just got here what is this joke
he's not going to be able to reach the car
The only time Jerma streams on a Saturday is when he has a family
Jerma youâ€™re the best, iâ€™ll be your sponsor forever
you can also buy a ring from the beggining for 100 rings
it's not like the game is anything special
I dont think you can kill her LUL
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Thursday! Around 4pm PST! It is 12:56 pm PST for Jerma. :D
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1034. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.

i love how the youtube channel is so active and it's just so many people talking at once

"I'm gonna leave the stream for a couple hours"
YOU NEED TO BE A PROFITER TO BUY A GLASS
you can make a ring from the beggining
YOU CAN PICK IT UP FOR FREE
you don't need the rock to get to the end of the level
What are you doing for 5 hours?

Hey jerma, is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
Hey chat lets make a jup with jermaOtto

I want to go to the dentist but I want to go to the dentist with my friends
you can make a deepfake of yourself and make it look like you're in a movie
i am so close to 100k points jermaVenus
I am actually doing this thing, I'm going to spend all my points on Jerma wink
I'm actually crying in my own fucking bed right now
I cant believe Jerma is watching the latest video on the jerma archive
is there a video of you beating the game?
you just watched a video of someone playing with a controller
I miss the old Jerma that didn't play video games
i was told that was a game in the last week
If you do it I will buy you a new laptop for $10k
they're going to kill the mayor of this city
It was fun just the first time but it was boring to watch
have you ever been to a restaurant?
your stream title is "The worst stream title ever"
this is how you get the bad ending
hey guys i made a video about how to make a mega milk chocolate bar
I dont want to be here for the next 10 hours jermaPluto

I'm an expert and I can say this is a 100%
jermaOtto You are very good at this game
You need to make the rat noise

I think that was a very serious bit
play the game I told you to play
you have to hold the button for the whole game

do you know how to play this game?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
theres no way he can do that
we can watch you beat this game
jerma is the only streamer i watch, he's my favourite
You can also play a game with a mod that makes it so you can see the game in your game
I feel like I'm in the middle of a fever dream
I think you need to go to the bathroom
you can buy a bunch of stuff from the store for 5 bucks
you can make the map bigger by placing bricks and other stuff in the room
what do you think of the new TF2 update?
you need to get a couple of friends to join
did jerma get to the part of the game where he accidentally shoots his own father?
it's weird seeing someone in chat with a fake twitch account
you don't want to see
====================
jerma is a scumbag who is secretly a scumbag
What are you saying you don't know
what the fuck did i just tune into
you're missing a lot of things here
I'm going to need you to start a job soon
why does he have so many teeth? LUL
He's gonna do the entire game in a single stream
That's how you get the two handed sword
Jerma you are not a true gamer, you are a complete failed gamer
I think the guy in the picture is fucking with you
You were supposed to be in the water
you can use the flagpole to get out of the water
Do you think you'll ever play the Monkey Island OST?
You have to make the other side of the boat go

THE SUN IS GOING UP, IT'S GOING DOWN
you know the one where they're all in the same spot?
do you know what a dildo is?
it's like you're playing a video game
I think you can turn it off in the options
you're gonna be in a coma for the rest of this stream
I've been trying to tell you that this is actually a horror game.
you should make a new character called Jerma985
Can you sing Happy Birthday for us?
you need to get all 3 of the hearts
The new expansion is coming out soon, play it!
you can go back and get it
The secret to beating the game is to not kill anything
this is the best game ever made LUL
jerma is the type of guy who'd ask for a raise if they dont want to be together
go to the library of spanish literature
you cant have a single soundboard in the same room
why are you playing this game when you could be playing it in the bathtub
you're gonna be like 30 years old
It's just a stand in the middle of the room
You can beat the final boss in this game :)
i wish jerma would give me a fiver gift
why did you decide to play this game
stop, you have a 2 week ban
jermaOld I don't like these old games anymore
i hope the vroomer makes it out of the casino
you have to get all 3 of the hearts
You look like a chad from Back to the Future
you need to turn off the game audio, it's not working
You're already a sub, you can get a sub now

I don't think I've ever seen someone so excited about something
what if theres a game that says "scream"
that would be a nice theme park ride
he's already going to be playing this for the rest of the stream
How long until he gets to the last level?
you can break the blocks by jumping
He said he'd play it in a few hours
would you say that you are the best streamer on twitch
you have to start from the beginning of the game
I had a dream where you and ster were arguing about whether or not to make a new tf2 character

its not even the same game as the first game
i was thinking of a joke where you play as a clown
Why is this guy wearing a backpack? LUL
Just buy a game that's more expensive, it's not that much.
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
I'm sorry for calling you a boomer, I didn't mean to say you were a boomer
im so happy you're playing this :)
i feel like the creator of this game is doing a good job of providing a deep understanding of what's going on
you are the only person on the server that can play this game
i will be back in a couple hours
Jerma what the hell is this level LUL
HEY JERMA REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID YOU WOULD PLAY A LEVEL LIKE THIS?
you have to finish it now, but if you fail it takes another hour
i got a ticket for being late :)
It's a new one with a different ending
you can do it with the vive controller
You know I'm something of a scientist myself
This is like that new Sonic movie
this is the most stressful thing ive ever seen
I love how they have a new one
theres a secret level, you can't do that
you dont have to get all the way down
you can get the splitter for free
you should play the 1st one, it's really good
you can use the hook to get on top of the truck
what if you want to get a free copy of ds3
Jerma the level has a chance to drop the grenade
what is the point of this if you dont want to play it
you can get an unlimited copy of this game now
I wonder what that fat guy is going to be like
your health is important to the story
this is just like the inside of the house
this is the best game ive ever seen
you should get a new one to play
you can use the hook to get on top of the truck
JERMA IS TRYING TO SCAM US AND WE'RE ALL RICH
This is the best stream of 2020 I'm so proud
you have to beat it if you want it to be on the stream
I'm pretty sure the "good" ending is the final boss
I'm really glad that Jerma is streaming today, I really hope he's doing alright
Hey can you say my last name right now thanks
Jerma your voice is like a 5th grade teacher
did you see the new katamari game?
You just have to beat the whole game
you should do the "I wanna be a celebrity"
You need to have the cheese bake oven on
that's the best sound design I've ever heard
I would suggest the fact that you can walk in the dungeon
He's gonna ask the fish if they want to eat him
I think he just went to the bathroom
They're making a new game, it's called "Don't Starve"
you can do it with the vive controller
that's why you're wearing a wig
@Jerma985
====================
"
please play the OST for the ending
please use your influence, the people are starving
this is the game where you die
you should try to get the actual thing on the screen
I just got here and I'm already confused
Just do it before the boomer and the child
please try out the new rat level, it's a real rat level
theyre gonna take it from you, it's fine
jerma is in the store with a gun
if you dont see it it isnt real
The only thing that needs to be sorted is the cards
you're going to die in 10 minutes
imagine what the actual fuck that would be
I'm so glad I got to see this
jerma would you rather have a fish or a snake
YOU DONT HAVE TO WATCH THE GAME FOR THE MOST HIGHLY FUN
are you going to play any more of the PUBG games?
why are you wearing a backpack???
i don't think you know how to play tbh
i have an exam on the 23rd of march
do you guys think jerma will play darksouls again?
I can't believe he's playing this game for the first time
I'm so happy I got to see this stream
this is gonna be a 12 hour stream
I have to go to bed soon
what do you mean by this game?
I bet you're a furry if you're into furry stuff
I'm gonna be the one that dies in one hit
"what if I'm the only one who loves you"
I'm actually kinda surprised they didn't do a lot of community content
I'm in a lot of pain but I'm just glad I'm not the only one
this is the one guy that says fuck you
I don't think he said it was going to be this stream
you're gonna get the gun for free
You're going to be stuck on this level for the next 3 hours
I think the voice actor for this is a bad actor
go to your house and play the game
hey jerma, you can do a face reveal
you can buy stuff with the real money
you can have two or three guns
this is the worst game of the decade
Hey have you ever played the new The Thing?
YOU CAN'T BEAT A GIRL WITH A SMOKE, IT'S A TORTURE
they are going to sue you for that
"what the fuck is that" "why do i need to know"
you can sell your other weapons for a lot of money
we need to get this guy to the top of his post
jermaChomp HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE BOOTS
you can have two or three guns
That's what happens when you get old
Jerma when are you going to play the new Animal Crossing?
didnt jerma do that to a bird
The people in this game are so fucking crazy
jerma we don't need to know about this
JERMA THE CAR IS GOING OFF THE GROUND
I'm glad Jerma is finally playing a game that I enjoy
I can't believe he has the ENTIRE GAME on the same level as last time
imagine not having a sub and being able to send a message
this is the guy who lost to pinwheel
is this the streamer that ate a shoe on stream?
you have to get the gun for free
The original Xbox had a controller that didn't have a slot
you can get a gun with the real money if you keep running
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who saw that
i have to go to bed, you're on the last screen.
Hey what's your favorite type of pepper?
can you play the game please :)
i don't think you have a fucking gun
I just joined and I'm already getting flashbacks of that
This is the most un-Jerma thing I've ever heard
how does it feel to be an influencer
I'm going to watch the VOD for this LUL
can you do the "I'll play this game" bit again
jerma needs to buy a $5 copy of this game
I'm so tired of this "jerma is late" joke
I think he said he'd be streaming on
====================
 D:
how many clips do you have left?
You are a better streamer than you were in a year ago
it's the title of your 2nd youtube video
Have you heard of the new Half Life?
i need to sleep but im still excited
if you're going to play that music you should play the snes rpg music
You look like a fat, fat, bald, and sweaty, you're kinda hot
you don't have to play this every stream, but you can say "I'm going to beat it"
You can change the setting of the game so it looks like a slideshow of the games
you can also use the scroll wheel to change the position of the cursor @Jerma985
I think you can unlock the door
that was one of the best streams of 2019
You can get a second glueman costume for 10 dollars
YOU DIDNT EVEN SAY THAT YOU HAD A BATHROOM
Why are the ones in the corner in the top left
you can play the levels of the levels
im having a great time and thanks for streaming
You look like a dead tree
when are you doing a face reveal?
i like to pretend that i'm something of a scientist myself
just go into the mine and explore, you'll be fine
jerma can you do a backflip for me?
You should probably read the news before you stream
I hope you get a good headstart in the next game.
jerma you can buy a copy of the game on steam
jermaHeart Clap <3 <3 LuvGift LuvGift LuvSign LuvSign
I think this is the best one
what if they had a different song at the end
why did he get a new car LUL
you should have just taken the bullet out of the back of the head
jerma have you ever played the show "The Movies"
hey jerma, i know you're a very funny man, but you have a very bad sense of humor.
If he doesn't show up in 15 minutes we are legally allowed to leave
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8 jermaJup9 jermaJup10
I really enjoy the streams but I really wanna see you play some more.
if you do the real answer, you win
I can't wait to see Jerma die in a lava lamp
The game makes you look bad, remember
jermaFireman I'm a firefighter, I'm the fireman
you have to make a new hero, then you can get the new hero
you need to turn off the game
why are we here to watch the movie
I can't wait for the "just dance" stream
hey jerma can i get a uhhh uhhh
you have to get in the water and fish
dont worry jerma you have more than 5 years
this is why you dont play the game
play the video of the chef doing this
look up the game and think of the puzzles
can you play a good game instead of this
you know what i don't like about this game?
do you have to put on the face cam?
theres a guy in the closet btw
put it in the microwave for 30 seconds
He's gonna die in the next 5 minutes
you should stop streaming so i can watch the VOD
jerma has been live for 4 hours 45 minutes and 46 seconds
I just got here, why are you still on the first floor?
I think the fireman one was like the best one
hey jerma just got back from the store. What's going on?
you can do it if you don't have a butt
I think you can turn it off and on again
hey jerma can you please turn on the stream
jerma you can't make your own chatroom
I think you should get the boots
I want to see you have a stroke
you should buy the infinity gauntlet boots
I'm trying to finish this game but the audio keeps repeating this whole
====================
 HERE
you should probably get a haircut and a new shirt
I like the idea of you playing a game
do you guys think he'll ever get to the end of the game?
this is gonna be the best stream ever
I'm gonna make a cake and eat it
is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
imagine how long it takes for the stream to start
he looks like a villain from the ed edd and eddy movie
this game is like a shitshow but it's really fun
what are you going to do if you get a ticket
what do you think of the new season of hit and run
the ball pit is on the right
Jerma is going to end up in jail
imagine how many times we would have gotten this award
it's the same guy, but in a different name
it's not like you have to play it
I'm trying to go to bed but you keep going down the same thing
you dont need to press the button for the gun
It's the one with the tiger in it
this is why you don't play games with subtitles
You can't say no to the Drew Crew
are you going to do the B-Sides again?
What about the "That's my job" line
you can use the shortcuts on the map to get to the inn
can you turn the music down a little?
jerma if you die in the game you die in real life
i hope you see this message again :)
you can find it in the steam workshop
Please play the rest of the game please
I'm gonna go play some of these games and then just watch your stream
how is this game so good, you're playing it in the studio?
JERMA YOU GOT A RIG IN YOUR FACE
YOU CAN'T TELL US IF YOU'RE A FAN
You need to be in a good mood to play this
HE'S GONNA BEAT THE GAME IN 5 MINUTES
you can still get a key with that
jerma theres a reward to get that you just need to get it
I can't believe this is the exact same game as the time the game was released
can you turn the music down a little bit?
YOU NEED TO BE AT LEAST 50% TO BE BANNED
jerma this is like the only time i have ever seen you play this game
I know the reason why Jerma doesn't like it so much is because he doesn't have the same personality as the other guy, but I know it's because he doesn't have the same sense of direction.
you dont have to make a new video every week
you can use it to do the secret boss
oh shit he's playing this with ster right now
I'm not going to lie I'm a bit of a noob myself jermaDafoe
it's the only way to save the world
if you're not making a sound, you're not making a sound
you're really good at this game. even though you're old and short
You can get a key with that if you play it
i can't believe i'm watching a fucking videogame
make a new video and upload it to twitter
if you have to play the game again, you're screwed
can you turn the music down a little bit?
you can save the world from a nuclear apocalypse
you should play the game, it's called Mario Sunshine
you guys are really fucking annoying, you're all invited
you just have to get rid of the queen
Jerma if you want to play this game call your mom
you need to get a new mouse
you can get a key with that
you can get a key with that
You're going to die in the next 10 minutes
imagine if they took you to the dentist and started playing
you could have just made a new account and it would have been perfect
I'm glad he played this game, it's so nostalgic
Are you gonna do the tutorial again?
I'm just here for the vod, please watch the vod
I don't think he knows how to use a controller
@Jerma
====================
1
you have to hit the blue button on the right side of the screen
I'm sorry but you have to do it
Why don't you just do the face cam?
do you really think you can eat the head
it's not like you're a professional actor
I think this is the only way
you have to do the final mission
I have a lot of fun with it too
you gotta go to the other side
What would you do if you saw this
you can walk in front of the door
you can use the space bar to make it bigger
I can't believe he's still playing this game
I'M GONNA THROW THIS ROCK AT YOUR BRAIN
stop putting the 2nd one in D tier
you could have gone for the head with the boots
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A SWEET
you know you can get the big stuff with the shovel?
I want to see what a garden is like
"I'm gonna take you to the library"
it's not as fun as you make it out to be
I'm pretty sure you can get the boots
Jerma I'm going to hit a fat, fat, fat, and then a fat, fat
it takes a while to tell what is happening but it's fun
I'm going to be a mod now so that you can be in the server
You can't just tell chat to fuck off
You should've chosen the smaller one instead of the big one
It's only a game if you don't have a controller
You should try to get a gift sub
you're gonna get to the end of the game
you're not even in the game yet
you can do it if you're a true gamer
remember when you said you wouldn't eat it?
it's a 1 in a million chance
I remember when you had to get to the top rope
The original Dead Rising 2 was a scam
its the only way to get the boots
You can turn it off in the options
Jerma you are the only person who could make it
the way i made this video was so fun
we need a new emote for this
how much did they pay you to do that
You can use the second arrow to move
it's not a frog, it's a lobster jerma
I didn't know you could do that
Why are you wearing a backpack? LUL
you can't just say "hello" it's an option
You're so good at making people mad I love it
don't worry about it, you'll have to do a few missions to progress
You should play RDR2, it's got a lot of story and a good story mode
That's what you get for playing the game
I'm watching this stream with my family, you should play the game instead
You're gonna need a lot of money to do that
why are you doing a bit in the middle of a game
go to the closest town and go to their town
YOU CANT JUST THROW THE DEAD GUYS AWAY
you can get a better sword for the money
Just go to the right, there's a portal
You can use the second arrow to move to the right.
YOU CAN DO IT ON THE LADDER
just get the boots for the boots
remember when you said you wouldn't eat it?
jerma you look like a serial killer
i love how he looks like he's about to throw up
are you still gonna play the other game?
Theres a secret boss in this game
i think you can do it, you just have to finish it
you have to beat the game first to play it
The music in this game is so good
This is the most realistic rendition of the Joker
this is the worst thing ive ever seen
YOU CAN DO IT ON THE LADDER
why did you make your character look like a goddamn dead body
why does the guy in the middle look like a fucking corpse
imagine being in the
====================
 I'm back to the start of the game
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
jermaHeart jermaHeart jermaJex2 jermaJex2 jermaHeart jermaJex2 jermaHeart jermaJex jermaJex jermaPluto
you can finish this game in 30 minutes if you want
can you get a tarantula in here, I'm trying to sleep
What are you going to play tonight?
do we get to see your boomer hair?
i've been gone for like an hour, are you still trying to get the boots?
i miss the old jerma that used to stream jermaPluto
You can just use the face cam as your own
Make the face cam the new sub sound
They're the same guy, they're both from the same family
I'm glad I didn't get a gift sub :)
you can just do it in a different game
you're not supposed to get your ass beat
you're too old for this game, you're not good enough to play it
If you don't get the boots I'm going to choke you out
You can do the same thing with your hand
You know what's more dangerous? Jerma's actual body parts
it's an enemy, you're gonna die
theres a vod of it so you can watch it
Do you think that a group of people can get together and have a good time and then hang out and watch Jerma
you have to get a key for it
this is the worst fucking game i have ever seen
You could have been a farmer and bought a house
why do i want to see you get hit by a car
im eating a bowl of oatmeal, could you do that
jermaOld this is too easy for me now
There is a spot with a door on the left
I'm gonna go buy a shit ton of toothpaste
what the fuck is going on with these people
the actual answer is they don't know LUL
you can use the facecam to flip your face
I know you are a big chronotrigger fan but why are you playing this game?
go to the edge of the universe
You can use the facecam to flip your face
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -106. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -442. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
please do a tier list of all the tier lists
I mean, you were supposed to be streaming at 3-4pm
he was talking about the fish tank thing
this is a very good game, not a good one
you should play the Simpsons Hit and Run OST
You can use the facecam to flip your face
I can't wait to see Jerma get crushed by a car
jermaWalk WE NEED TO GET OURSELVES SOME CRACK jermaWalk
he's gonna be late again jermaPluto jermaPluto
please stream now or I'm going to fucking scream
you should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
this is the guy who beat the game on stream?
I'll admit it, I'm a little off on the internet
just play the game please, it's a good game :)
its okay, you don't have to be tall to be a rapper
you can buy a ton of different games for like $10
dont forget to take the vase from the scene
I just got here what is going on
please play the game again please
can you do the clown voice, it's really funny
That's not how you pronounce It jerma
I'm still waiting for the day when we can legally consume his skin
I'm a new viewer, but this is very good
Jerma why does this game have a fucking blood clot in it?
i wonder if jerma has a video of the yogi painting
You can turn it off and on again
just make it so the stream ends and we can watch the VOD
please watch the scary movie "The Thing" its out now on Netflix
I don
====================
TheEggs
I can't believe you've been telling people to submit feet pics in the discord for the next community content night
just go to sleep for the night jerma
he did a boomer joke about getting hit by a car
this is the streamer who died to pinwheel
this is just the beginning of a bit
I just got here and I'm already disappointed
There's a button that automatically starts a new game
"I'll be back in an hour or two"
He is going to die in the first hour
i hope jerma doesn't die in the first 5 minutes
why does the pizza in the top left look like a pizza
you can only eat it at the buffet
I'm starting to think the game might have been rigged from the start
jerma you should make a website called "jermaEarth" that tracks the amount of time that is left in the earth
i dont want to see the inside of a human
it's like a sex thing, don't be afraid to take it
he's going to die to a car
when you are not streaming, I'm gonna be so fucking sad
you have to click the red button
Jerma is a very smart man, he knows how to play this game
If you die you'll never get the boots
The game is a rip off of this game
I can't believe he actually did the stream
can we get a petition for Jerma to play a game called "Mystery Game"
you can use the menu button to switch between the different sounds
you should get a better pc for this game
if you die to pinwheel, you die in real life
did you know that there's a fucking pinwheel
Are you going to finish Sam and Max season 3?
are you the one that said no politics
I'm so happy you're still streaming this game
no, theres a ladder to get down
this is the dark souls of animal crossing
The game is a ripoff of the Super Mario RPG
I've never been so stressed out of a job as I am now
Just put your face over the camera dude
This game is for adults, you can't read this
will you play the new pokemon channel?
you can play it off stream with the sound on
I'm glad you finally finished the game
You're gonna have to play this again
you can get the extra money at the arcade
are you gonna play the new pokemon channel
Jerma you should play the new Animal Crossing
The kids are gonna come back to this LUL
JERMA YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB! A GREAT JOOOOOOOOOOOO
it takes a while to get used to
i would make a better spongebob character than this
jerma i hope youre having a good day
can you just say "it" and "this" at the same time?
you can get a lot of loot from this game
can you please put your shirt over the fire
Are you gonna play the new Animal Crossing?
There's a secret in the ice area
I can't believe this is the guy who beat Dark Souls on stream
get the boots before you die pls
It's the same thing with the bus, but you can use it as a shield
I'm sorry I didn't mean to say it
i have a feeling you're gonna get arrested for tax fraud
you just got a very high score
You have to get the boots, the boots make the game better
when are you going to play metal gear rising?
You know what they say, the best time to be a man of culture
I think you need to drink more water
you need to use the game console
I bet you don't even own a Wii
you have to get the boots to get the boots
I'm not gonna lie, this game looks really cool
it is a very good game, please do not play it
you can get the boots at the arcade
This game looks like a fever dream, I'm here for a real one.
Is that the voice of the guy that has the fart noise?
i don't think this game is
====================
This is the most you can do it
why are they all in the same place?
Jerma do you really think you can do this?
I can't believe Jerma is actually streaming right now
You can change the difficulty in the options
i'm pretty sure this is the only way
would you consider making a tf2 clone?
I think we should get a jermaVenus emote
you need to get a more powerful axe
This is like the Dead Space 2 intro
you should play this game again, it's got a really good story and you can enjoy it
JERMA YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE MOST LEVEL OF YOUR CLASS
if you're looking for a job, try some real estate
I've seen you in a couple of times
Play a good game of the video game
you need to go to the very beginning
you don't have to press the buttons to do things
theres a big hole in the wall
I just got here and this looks like a movie
It's a shame the graphics were too much
you were supposed to eat the shoe
this is the most fucked up thing ive ever seen
This is the only one that works
That's not how it works, you have to jump when you get hit.
You should play the game again, it's been out for like 8 months
Have you ever seen a girl in your dreams?
I dont think it was in the original game
how many quarters does it take to beat this?
what do you think of the new sonic movie?
if you get shot once, you get shot twice
I'm surprised you didn't play the rat level, it's a boss
i miss when jerma wouldnt be in chat jermaPluto
Make sure to keep the camera on at all times
just cheat on it with the other guy
I will give you 200 dollars if you play this
I just realized the thumbnail is of Jerma playing with the controller
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULDN'T GO TO THE SAME BAR
You need to do the Talk to Transformer stuff, he said it's "very important"
It's not a video game, it's a really good game
please play "The Thing" I want to see how you do
JERMA YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
do you still have the "This is what happens to me" hat
It's a fucking sewer level you know
oh my god the sound design in this game is shit
your body is making the sound of the police
You can't save the game without the boots
i have a lot of them, i think you should try them
what if you had a ton of gems
Have you heard of the new Sonic movie?
jerma is so bad at this game LUL
"I'm getting a job interview, I'm gonna be a mod"
if you can't handle a 6 hour stream then you're a fucking fool
Is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
you're like the kid from Family Guy
You're gonna get some real brain damage from this game
i think you should try the new one, it's a lot more interesting
that's a really good idea, don't forget about the new baby
you're only in the first level you can't do the rest
when you get to the final room, it'll show you your stats
Have you seen the new Scooby Doo movie?
The bar has a little light in it, that light helps you see where you are
"i want to see a dead body" -jerma
what's the point of the game if you can't change the game
go to the blue area, you can get a lot of stuff here
is this what you do with your channel points?
You're going to get a real heart attack
you're a hard working man. this is your money.
oh my god what is happening I just joined
the only thing you're not good at is eating ass
@
====================
T
That's a good name for a guy
this is a christmas stream, remember to give presents
That guy looks like he's been wearing a diaper on stream
jermaOtto "A man of culture and ideas"
we're gonna need a JermaOneguy for this
you know the one right? it's called star wars
jermaWalk we're the rats, we're the rats jermaWalk
do you remember the time jerma used to stream?
he's just standing there and watching the whole thing
you can use it to move around, you just need to hold the button for a while
I like how this is just a really long hallway
imagine going to the store and seeing this guy walking around
I think you need to use the axe
i would love to see jerma play viscera clean up with the rest of the chat
You can make a shield with that
how many points for jerma to wink for me
can you put on a bit of "I'm not joking"
i hope jerma gets a B in his final
The thing is, there's still a few more hours left
you gotta get the big ones first
you just lost the last two games
oh yeah its all good, i forgot about that
if you can do it i'll forgive you :)
I don't know what they're called but I love the font
S E N D S O O L
I've been watching your vids for like 2 hours now and you're still playing this game
You have to use the right stick on the table to hit the target
You're the only one playing this game, we're just waiting
Oh my god, I'm so fucking glad I got this game
the kids are gonna die in the first week
can you explain the plot of this game
i'm so excited for the live action rumble
this is what happens when you take a bath
I'll tell you what happens when you take a bath
jerma you can make a shield with that
you can use it to move around, you just need to hold the button for a while
Just like you have been a good boy Jerma :)
I hate all the people in this chat
do you have a picture of your face on the other side of your mouth?
he got the whole army in his army
this is the most fucked up stream of all time
you can use it to move around, you just need to hold the button for a while
I've seen you playing this game, please do not stop
if you just go to the bathroom, you'll be in the bathroom.
can you show us your feet pics?
just like a twitch streamer doesn't have a license
the main character in this game is a substitute teacher
if you die in the game you die in real life
did you do the voice of a spirit?
i can't believe i was here for the last hour of this stream
i remember when jerma wasnt a sub FeelsBadMan
you can use it to move around, you just need to hold the button for a while
you need to do the voices again
why do people always buy the best games
I can't believe Jerma is in chat rn
you can make a shield with it
you can just use it and move around
you know you can just get the teleporter and get back to where you started right?
that's the only reason to watch this stream, you'll get to see your family again
is this the streamer that ate a shoe ON STREAM?
I would've been so mad if I stayed home
he's not actually the ant, he's just a small ghost that appears when youre near him
you can use it to move around, you just need to hold the button for a while
Is this the streamer who ate a shoe ON STREAM?
do you remember the ending of the last of us?
The only way to win is not to play
Jerma, it's been 15 years, please wake up.
can you please not play as the rat in this game?
This is like the music from the Tony Hawk game
you can use it to move around, you just

I'm sorry I didn't realize you were playing the game for the first time, thanks for the stream jermaHeart
theres a secret in the closet behind the secret door
what are you doing with your life?
i love how jerma is trying to get us to play the game but he can't even play it in time

he can't even say pee pee poo poo anymore
You can get a bunch of doritos with that
I'm not going to lie, this looks really fun

you can move the cursor by holding R+T
theres a secret in the closet behind the secret door
i just got here, why is he still playing this
you can get a bunch of doritos from the vending machine
why do you want us to play this game?
you should play more games with the doritos
You didn't even say anything about it OMEGALUL
you should play the original Dead Rising 2, it's really good
dont forget to check the water supply
Can you do the voice of the egg guy?
you need to get the ring for the secret
it's in the last section of the game
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
There's a secret in the closet behind the secret door

I would have a heart attack if I saw you playing this game
you should play with the game audio

you can do a level in the air
I hate you so much you're going to become a real gamer
jerma you are a total idiot, youre supposed to be good at this game
did you play this game or something
You have to walk the entire island to get the doritos
it was a good stream, the joke was funny, but it was a bad one
Jerma I'm begging you to play the new Wii U game. It's so good
you could also go to a public library and put in a library book
theres a secret in the closet behind the secret door
you have to walk the entire island to get the doritos
this is the most fucked up game ive ever seen
theres a secret in the closet behind the secret door
I wonder what the game is about tbh
You're doing a good job, it's just a joke
you're doing a good job, it's just a joke :)
don't worry, it's just a "haha it's funny" game
====================
If you had to choose between the Mario and Luigi games, Which would you choose?

Hey chat, Jerma is gonna be here for like 2 hours, you know?
I'm glad I got to catch this stream :)
you need to get a high iq level

I got the wrong door, the one you got the right door
Jerma what do you think of the new breed of Nancy Drew?

i just got here and i'm already losing my mind
you have to go left to the right

You could have made it to the end of the game
Do you know what a JPEG is?
you know you can do it in this game
you can use the water to grow trees

I just got here and I'm already lost

It's been a week, you have to do it again
I'm so glad you're playing this game
If you don't take it off I'm gonna shit my pants

use the cheat codes in the discord
JERMA YOURE NOT THAT BAD YOURE A BAD GAMER
you have to put the mic down
i can't believe this streamer is still on this game
Are you gonna do the Cooking Mama Cooking stream?
Oh boy this is gonna be a good one

this is like the guy from family guy
its literally a man in a wheelchair who is trying to get to the store
it's not a virus, it's an ad
that's why you're the only one who can beat this game
I just got here, why is the game audio so bad?
I'm in the mood for some SANDWICH but I'm not going to go until I'm at least 25

I saw the clip of you eating shoes, and I really liked it.
I'm going to send you a picture of my cock and balls if you don't stop streaming

I mean, there are probably some games you could play with a mouse that aren't as good, but are fun
you have to make your own food
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
you are so bad at this game
It's just a giant hole in the wall
jerma you just had to time it out
this is one of those games you play while you're at the dentist

the fact that you're late is because you're a complete moron
I have a very large collection of Speedruns of this game

just wait till you see the boots! You could have picked them up in the meantime!
The speedrun of this game is a bit over 15 minutes, so maybe you should start at 12 or something

You should get a better computer, it's pretty much the same as your old one
The only way to win is not to play

I'm so glad you're playing this game. I was so excited for this game.
====================
 to the one on the left
Hey Jerma, just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan of your content.
dont worry you can just keep running past them
I'd be impressed if you were actually a real gamer
This is like a lot of the same games
I wanna be in the next Jerma Rumble
I think it's a bit slow, but it's not like you're going to run out of time
you have to raise the difficulty a few times to really do the joke

I can't believe Jerma is a Big Boi :(
would you rather have a fight with the ghosts
what is this some sort of currency thing?
Play the video where you rant about the game's UI.
you can make your own but you have to do it in a different console
you can just run through the empty room
HE'S NOT GONNA BE THIS BAD AT VIDEO GAMES
if you were a spy, would you say you were a spy?
There is a reason you can't get a license to drive a clown car
I have a theory that you just woke up
I wonder what the difference is between the two games
jerma do you think they will be able to play this?

I think you have to jump and shoot the missiles
I'm pretty sure this game is based on the books
You have to wait in the swamp for the treasure

jerma you have to walk into the light
it's an auto click, its in the settings

You need to go to the tavern, its free
they got rid of the two towers for this
how the fuck is a person even here
i think you're supposed to stop the game now
didnt he say he was going to be starting soon?
If he's not here in 20 minutes I'm gonna be pissed

i cant believe jerma was the only one to watch the movie
I want to see the smile on your face
you can just shoot the missiles from the air
you need to use the wind to move
I can't believe Jerma got rid of Twitch Prime jermaPluto
I'm not sure, I'm not a sub but I'm here for you

You have to go to the tavern, its free
you can do it in a few hours
i thought it was a joke until you said it

jerma has a cold, he cant do this
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is a JUP, I'll take it
i am so disappointed in jerma for not making a joke
what do you mean? he said he's going to play Ace Attorney
did you ever get the new xbox?
why does your mom remind you of the game?
how is this game made? I just joined
what did you do to deserve this?
he could have just saved the game and played it
I want to see Jerma get mad at the game for being bad at it
you should have played the first one
you need to be able to pick up the ring
I miss the old Jerma that got the first of his name
why are you playing this game? you look like a fucking nerd.
you have to buy the DLC for it
It's not a real house it's a house made of junk
YOU CAN LEAVE THE GAME IF YOU PRESS R2
i think he was talking about the game being too easy
jerma has to beat this game in an hour
The wii version has a better sound
The lady next to the girl is a weirdo
I'm so glad I got here early this is amazing
if you want to win the game just buy a new memory card, it's worth it
I like how he looks like a middle school teacher
can you explain the FUCKING GAME FOR US
There is a girl in the family :)
why is jerma playing a horror game? what is he playing?
don't forget to set the "start stream" to something that makes it more enjoyable
You're the one who gets things done around here
jermaPluto jermaPluto jermaHeart I hope he plays another game
You can always ask the mods to ban you, but they won't
Did you see that game on the news?
that's a gift from the lord of the rings
what if you just skip the first level?
YOU CAN LEAVE THE GAME IF YOU PRESS R2
get a new memory card that has a built in memory card
you're gonna have to do another race
you have to kill the big guy
I'm not going to tell you this, but I'll say it. This is the most boring game ever created.
I have no clue how this game works but I'm glad you're enjoying it
this is like the first time in a long while that i've seen jerma
I can't believe Jerma has such a big ego
Do you know what a soap is?
i can't believe he got the virus for the first time LUL
jerma is going to get scammed by the end of this stream
how long does it take to get to the sun?
I don't think he's ever going to play this game again
he's doing this to get the money LUL
You need to go to the basement again
you can kill the fish in the water and they'll swim to spawn
put the one youre at the top
he is so small that it makes him look bigger
what about the time you shidded a guy in your room?
he looks like a dude who died to pinwheel
YOU CAN LEAVE THE GAME IF YOU PRESS R2
do you know what a chinese restaurant is?
The voice acting in this game is amazing.
You can tell theyre trying to get him
i wonder if this is gonna be a good stream
I have never seen you play a game so you're on fire
did you just say "I am the sun"
It was only a couple of hours before you got to level 100
JERMA I'M TRYING TO SLEEP, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA PLAY THIS GAME.
I just got here and I already think this is a horror game
I have a crush on a guy named jerma
hey can you remind me what a burger looks like
you know you can make a lot of money

You can't just say that and expect it to work
i am so mad i am going to start an AYAYA

I remember when you started this whole thing.

Please change the music, it's just the same song
I'm waiting for Jerma to play the next game :)

Hey jerma if you're reading this, please stop. I know streaming can be stressful, but doing all this crazy fucked up shit for views isn't sustainable. So please have some common sense and tone it back. You're really making me go monkaS.

Hey Jerma, I'm glad you're playing this, I'm watching the VOD.

I'm a little embarrassed that I'm not the one that saw it
it was your best friend that you had to help you through it, you were my best friend until you were killed
I'm so glad Jerma has a consistent stream schedule
you can do it, it's called a joke
you need to get the boots first
how do you make a water fountain

you can use the scout, it's a mini map
I'm gonna go watch this stream until Jerma gets here

why is this game so good? it's got a lot of neat features.
you can use the scout, it's a mini map
You have to hit the yellow button to go back to the main menu

Do you think you'll ever do a stream with Joel?
I remember this game being a little hard.
you should probably get the boots for this
what would you say is the worst analogy ever
don't forget to look for the hidden chests, they are really easy to get
I love how the chat is so active when Jerma is not streaming
why would you just do the same thing over and over again
i love how the game is just a fancy gta video
I wish they would have just made a really shitty game
this is like the art of a clown
I hope you have a good time with Kim
You are a bad influence, the game is just a bad joke

you can't even see his face in the video
You're going to make it to the next episode of Game of Thrones
oh yeah, I thought this was a trainwreck
why is your character's name so weird
you can use the bubble on the ground
put a bunch of "consumables" in the trashcan

When you're on the roof, jump, and spray
when are you going to play the game that's been out for 7 years?
The best way to get away from being a part of this

You can get one if you know what i mean :)
I don't think I've ever seen this game before
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.

this is the equivalent of a traffic light LUL
If you dont play the rest of the game I will eat my fingernail
i was just making a comment about the game awards and jerma said he was gonna play the one with the sunglasses
I don't have the money for the carnival stream so I'll probably just sit here and wait for the stream
That's the face he makes when he beats the shit out of a baby
dont tell me what to do with my life
he just wants to show us what he has
did you hear that everyone in the game is a furry?
the longer you keep talking to yourself, the more you make the joke :)
I want to see Jerma play this game but I don't want to miss the stream
i'm going to spend all my money on coin pushers
this is so much better than the last game
Jerma is so invested in this game LUL
Jerma is gonna be a good gamer
You should play the one on the right

I'd rather watch this than the actual movie
you could be a millionaire and have an entire circus and have that on the movie night
i think you have to do the "make a joke" option

did anyone see the picture of Jerma with his dog's dog?
I'm back and the stream is great. I'm excited to see you all again :)
he's the bad guy in this game, he doesn't care
If you don't do it in one stream I'll give you 100 dollars

jermaOld I have to do my chores, I'm too old
you can use the teleport to go through the door
can't believe he's playing this for the first time
This is a really good game. It's not bad but it's not very good.
You know, that is why you are so good at it
You are the only person who has ever played this game
just play a real game and make it better
Do you have a limit on how many you can hold in the game?
Why are you wasting the money on a random item
LUL i cant wait for jerma to get to the final level
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
Just do it for the next 30 minutes :)
You have to do the quest to unlock the secret
The sun is just a giant head, that's all
It's not even a game, it's a joke
i dont think jerma is a real gamer
you have to use the spear before the last boss
If you die in the game you die in real life
you should play more sonic adventure 2, its better
I'm not sure why but I like it
you have to have a lower limit on how many people can join
if you dont play the DLC you're not a real gamer
i remember that this was my childhood jermaOld
I'm so glad you're not playing this anymore.
I think this is the most difficult game in the world
i just got here what the fuck is happening
I've never seen this game, I'm a dumbass :)
you know who would be the funniest streamer
You've been playing this for an hour, you've been in a coma for like an hour. Please wake up Jeremy
Jerma, are you really going to play the whole game?
this is the most repetitive thing youve ever done
you can use the teleport to go through the door
youre just gonna throw it out the window
play "Crazy Train" it's like a remix of the original song
you're the one who gets things done around here
Hey remember when you said that you wouldnt beat this game?
jermaSun I'M A TURTLE I'M NOT A MURDERER
Just don't give it to him, he'll take it anyways
How much did you pay for this?
I would have loved this game more if you were playing it
The more you say it the more it hurts
JERMA YOU HAVE TO GET THE BOOTS NOW
I'm pretty sure this is your last stream with us
i really want jerma to play bloodborne again
I'm not sure what game this is but it looks really good
JERMA, WHATS THE POINT OF THE GAME IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
I'm gonna go watch the vod, I'm sure of that
DONT WORRY WE ARE BEGGING FOR THE GAME
i think he was just trying to talk to himself
I really hope Jerma will read this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KF7Yc2F9p0

you can use the teleport to go through the
====================
I'm sorry, but you can't be late in this case.
Jerma is the only streamer who can afford to buy a bunch of hats
I'm going to be honest, I thought that was a joke.
It's like a dickhead playing a game
it's like the most -2 thing you can do
it's okay, you can say you're not in it
How are you still playing this game?

I bet he could fit like, 2 big dogs in there
you can go to any place in the world
I am so glad I can watch this stream
I feel like you should start the stream
I think you can use it to check the status of your ship
I wish Jerma would do a funny voice :(
you can see how much work he has put into this game
he looks like he's in a white coat
you should have played some of the other games
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM NOW
its not a bad stream if you dont have friends
you can do a super jump and get a free hit
I can't believe that was a whole week ago
why did you make your webcam the new fucking emote
this is a game for boomers with no experience
This game is just a game to teach you the dangers of gambling
Jerma you need to see the dog next time
You have to get to the top rope first
can you imagine if you had this game
I miss the old jerma, the one that could play jump king
I don't think you can get to the top of a building without jumping
go to the moon you boomer :)
If you have a weapon equipped, you can use it on the boss
I'm gonna go to bed, goodnight chat jermaHeart
would you say you're the worst streamer on twitch right now?
he just wanted to get the free milk
do a tier list of all the games you've played
I really like how Jerma985 just watches this shit
you're just a pawn in the game
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD WATCH IT OR NOT
I'm not sure, but I do prefer the short streamer
you can still make it up if you don't want to
You just learned how to play the game
The power source is the power source

oh boy i love this streamer i can't wait for the stream
hey Jerma, can you play the new Animal Crossing music?
You look like a fucking spider man

I really hope Jerma does the voice for this game.
I bet you can't even beat a level
just jump on the blue ball and hit the red ball
you can still get the free milk from the vending machine
Why does Jerma always lie to us :(

"I'm not gonna eat it" "NO"
what if you were to have a heart attack
you can't just throw it at them

You need to go back to the beginning of the game
he's just gonna ignore you and do nothing
You need to go back to the beginning of the game
I wish I could play this game more
why would you do that? the game has you as a hostage

you can make your own food at home
I can't believe they paid Jerma to do this
if you want to start the stream now you should go watch the VOD

This is the best game, you can play this for hours
Jerma you need to get the boots
You should play Darkwood, it's a good game

YOU SAID THE SAME THING FOR 5 HOURS
this is the most fucking dumb thing ive ever heard
you can't just shoot the bullet and do it again

jerma you look like you're having a stroke
you can make your own food at home
jermaOld I remember when Jerma used to stream

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 MAKES ALL OF DA RULES jermaJup3 jermaJup4

THE BOOTS IN THE BASE ARE FOR SCENES
you need to get a car to get the boots
you can get it from the main menu in the main menu

You were right about the blue stuff, the game is rigged from the start
you are making me cry for real
how do i skip ahead in the movie
you cant have a single "i" in your name
Can you do a tier list of the top 100 greatest hits of all time?
you know, im something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
you should check out the other games you played, they are some of my favorite
I'm glad Jerma finally decided to play Darkwood and it's good
he's going to die on his way to his room
is the dude in the top right making a circle
i remember when you said you were gonna play minecraft again
I just got here, what is this "Coffee Cheetos Chicken" game?
you could have just played the DLC instead
theres a checkpoint after you get the boots
I hope you know how to get the boots.
you have to make a joke now @Jerma985
this game is for people who don't have a PS2, you can only play with the 360 controller.
they are called "disciples" because they do a lot of the work
is this the guy that died to pinwheel?

I
====================
 is the last of us jermaPluto
if you don't have a gamer license then you're not a gamer
YOU NEED TO PICK UP THE SPELL
the only reason you're playing this game is for the story
HEY JERMA, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN
this is the most generic game i've ever seen
you don't need to say it out loud
HE'S LYING ABOUT BEING A LLEYO MANIAC
it's because you were pretending to play a game
They have to pay you to beat it
I'm getting sleepy. I'm not going to finish the stream until you finish
you can make a character with a normal shirt
I have to get up at 3am for work
why is jerma so bad at this game
i just got here why is he still playing this
you can get a mod that replaces wink with a permanent one
That's not how you pronounce The New England.
you look like a serial killer
please do a stream where you play as the tutorial boss
There are only 1 and 2 good ones
I'LL GET A SUB RIGHT NOW I'M GIVING YOU SUB
I'm a mod and I hate this game
this is why jerma is not a real gamer
if you die in the game you die in real life
they're trying to trick you into thinking you're playing a game
he's going to come back from the bathroom
you can just make the default settings to not have to play this
PLEASE READ THIS, JERMA, THE DREW CREW IS DEAD, YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM
jermaPluto this is what happens when you don't stream
you can see it by the power button
if you press the button to say "YO" you can say it
you're the only person I've ever watched
you can't get the yellow key on the final boss
can you do the "I wanna be a good girl" joke again?
he's trying to find the sickest shit LUL
i think you have a lot of health
You can have one of those as a gift
i love how the mods are in chat
imagine the amount of effort you would put into a singleplayer game
HEY JERMA, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN
this is a better game than the simpsons hit and run
you should play the song "Moms Making Cookies" its got a loop
you dont have to do anything, just run in front of the truck
This is the "Halo" of games you've played
stop pretending to be bad at the game and play it
You can use the divine confetti as a shield
What if you get a dog, I mean, what if they're both dogs?
you can just buy a whole house from the market
you just have to do the same thing over and over again
you can use the divine confetti on a shield to negate the confetti damage
I can't believe this guy is a professional malding streamer
you can always change your mind, just play a different game
Why is he still playing this game? LUL
I'm glad you're doing well. I know you have a lot to learn, but it's nice to see you enjoying the game, and so are you.
I love how the mods are all in chat
I think you need to get the boots
you can make a character from the gnome

You can get more money in the game
I have a clip of the past stream and it's from when you were playing with Joel https://clips.twitch.tv/DignifiedBlanner

YOU CAN WALK ON LAND WITTH THESE LEGS YOU CAN WALK ON LAND

Did you see the new episode of spongebob?
Did you hear about the new vegas?
oh yeah they're in the same time zone
why did you decide to play this instead of the other one
I have a feeling you'll like it but I'm not sure
You could use a cheat code to get the coin
That's what you get for not having a sub
we need to get the REAL COX stream
I love that Jerma is playing the game but just having a meltdown
You can play with the gameboy advance to 986 with the japanese audio
I like how you can make a fucking LOT of money

You're gonna get banned from Twitch for calling them out
JERMA YOUR HEAD SHOOTING IS GONNA BLOW UP
you'll be too old to play minecraft jerma
you need to use the white noise
It's just a dumb trick, but it works

You're gonna die in the game
you can't just say that and not say it
jermaWalk HOLD RIGHT THERE, TAKE THE FUCKING LEFT jermaWalk

I hope heâ€™s playing the game with you
This is not the one with the boss
just a bunch of people all at the same time
You can make a bunch of cool stuff
You should be able to do the entire game in one stream

YOU CAN THROW A ROCK AT THE TREE TO DAMAGE IT
When you look at the top of his head it says you're not a real gamer
LUL why is he using the claymore? LUL

i wish i could go back and play this game
I love the cutscenes in this game too
we should get a 1/10 on this game
jermaVenus PUT THE CAMERA ON AND SHOW US THE TINY STREAM

It's like that scene in The Thing where they're the Thing
I'm going to sneeze, you have to sneeze
jermaWalk JERMA985 GOING TO START A NEW LIFE jermaWalk

Have you heard of the new Sonic Adventure?
You could just get a memory card and put it in your pocket
you're gonna have to do another tutorial to get it
you don't have to put it in your mouth
Do you think you'll ever play Mother 3?
you can't take it easy, you're gonna get crushed
it's just the end of the world Kappa
he's gonna get the last boss on the last level
If you don't use the car you'll die
theres a bunch of things you can do with it
He's gonna be in the next jerma rumble

you need to make a new house
you can see the shape of the rat's ass
The sound design in this game is really good

You have to get the ring to unlock it
I cant wait for the inevitable end of stream joke
@Jer
====================
imagine being a girl in a girls' club LUL
You are a fucking scammer, please never stream again
jermaIQ I'm a genius I'm the only one that knows how to play
you should try to do the car level with the car
you look like a villain from badlands
you know, you could have just had the real voice
you can finish the game in 30 minutes
I would have been proud of you for this
if you're not here in 15 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
i cant believe this guy is playing a game he doesnt like
The official patch notes for this game have been leaked
What is this music? I can't hear the game
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
this game has a bad review on rotten tomatoes
Why are you still in this house LUL
do you have the mod to turn your audio off?
i'm gonna see you guys in a few months
Iâ€™m gonna be really sad if you donâ€™t finish this game
you have to find the water source
no, just do a "you know what, it's the right way"
just make a new account and get a new sub badge
you can only do that in a dungeon
It's ok Jerma, we all know you're a tuber
"IT WASNT A GAME" - Jerma, January 2019
do you know what a drop is?
I'm playing this game and I'm in an absolute panic please help me
can you do the "I'm so fat I can't even look" joke again?
You've been in a coma for 3 days, please wake up
that's like 20 years of content and 2 hours of ads
imagine being a girl in a girls' club LUL
That was the most boring thing I've ever heard you say
It was a zombie game, it was free
Why are you so obsessed with those games
i want to play this game but i cant jermaPluto
why did you do that to us :)
I'm not sure what's going on in this game
imagine if the seagul was actually in this
it's a tiny cardboard box that you can hold in your hand
you can take the gun to the ocean
you should have said "You know what im going to do"
it was a bunch of people trying to get a hug from one another
the new update is called Stardew Valley
you need to buy all the DLC first
Is that why you never see the tutorial
Just do it for a couple of days, you can do it in one go
you should do a tier list of all of your tier lists
You should do a "Shit Show" stream where you try to make funny sounds that are uploaded to your channel every day
This is the last level of this game
You can't run an ISP, you can't sell your service.
you have to go through all the tutorial
what if the cow is a ghost and its just one of the cow's eyes?
what if you go to the bank and lose all your money
your character has a huge dick, you might wanna consider changing it
i dont think you can do the same thing in a room with the same floor
can you do the "I'm so fat I can't even look at my phone" joke again?
you just want to go to the store and buy your own lightbulb
can you play the new metal gear solid vr game
I like how the cat doesn't care about the dog
you're gonna get banned for it jerma
This is gonna be a long stream
jerma i thought you said you were gonna play this on stream but i didnt see your comment
You can put it in your pocket
you can take the gun to the ocean
Jerma, we love you, but the game is boring to watch.
You just have to make a huge lake in the middle of it
jerma please do a stream where you sit in front of a camera for an hour, then stream for another hour
play the game to see what the new features are
I swear to
====================
I'm having a good time watching this stream, I'm just feeling a bit tired of the boring parts
When are you going to play the new Half Life?
I think it's gonna be an airhorn stream
How are you going to use your health bar
can you please play the sequel to this game?
I'm not gonna say it, but it looks like a torture pit
You're not gonna be able to do it
you could play all the games in this
There's only one thing that can go right
you're supposed to have a lot of health
Youâ€™re not gonna get any better than this
Iâ€™m gonna go eat a burger with a fork, youâ€™re too lazy
I'm gonna turn on the stream and you're gone
JERMA JUST GOT A NEW GAMEPLAY AUDIO
I hope they get to see the other two games
This is like a dark souls level
theres a difference between a rat and a lego
i'm glad we got a game to celebrate
you have to keep going up and down the stairs
can you turn it up a bit?
i love the fact that theres a sub sound in this game
jerma you're just a bad parent :(
jerma when are you going to play halo reach
It was one of the first games I played, but the story was a bit off
You have to eat a whole shoe to finish the level
please go to the morgue and come back
I can't believe he's still playing this game LUL
I think you need to eat more
why are you playing a game where you shoot your own troops?
He's gonna die on the 23rd of March
you can use it to get to the shop
Hey jerma can you tell me what the game is called
the only people who don't like this game are the ones who voted for it
you're a serial killer, you can't kill me :)
did you ever see the picture of the rat that had a hole in it
if you didn't have to use the health bar it would have been much easier
you can use it to get to the shop
I'm not sure, I don't have any jermaIQ
do you know how to play the game?
i like how he's just playing this game
LUL he doesnt know about the max combo
this is going to be a good stream
There's a special place in hell for people to get their money
DIDN'T YOU HEAR THE TURTLE ON THE POLAR TRAIN?
you have to eat a whole shoe to finish the level
Jerma, you don't have to say anything. Just say "I'm a furry"
did you hear that Jerma is a furry
I hope he beats this one first try
play whatever you want to play :)
I've seen people die in this game at a kids game
it's okay if you're a little too tall
he has to do a tier list every stream
jerma you have to put the facecam on for us to see
Jerma, you're a serial killer, you can't be a doctor
I think you're about to be in a coma.
I think you need to get the boots
how are you so bad at this game
your webcam is on why do you look so fucking dead
i'm going to take a nap can you play something relaxing
you have to eat a whole shoe
You have to eat a whole shoe to get to the shop
you have to eat a whole shoe to get to the shop
Jerma985, you're the only one that got me into TF2, I'm so proud of you!
"i'm not gonna do it" is the worst stream of the year
you just had to get the boots
if you're so good at something never do it for free
i dont remember the last time i had to pee
I'm going to shit my pants if you dont start playing again
what if you just eat your own shoe?
is this the streamer that peed his pants on stream?
you're supposed to eat a whole shoe to finish the level
You need to
====================
I would have loved this game as a kid
I've been going through the same problems as you, just a little more careful.
This is like the 3rd time this has happened
my first jerma stream was the one where I lost my virginity
dont forget the people who just got pogged in the head
imagine if he actually made it to the top of the video
it's just a little bit of salt and a little bit of vinegar
I'll let you in the bathtub, Mr. Streamer
I can't believe you'd do this to me
You can switch to a different character later, it's just like how you did it in the first game
you can use the world record to see how far you are
i'm going to sneeze if you keep this up
JERMA THERE ARE A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN YOUR ROOM
you should try to find a way to do it on stream
I'm going to hear this song in my nightmares
Is this the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?
you have to do the "I'm not a human"
jermaChomp B A T T I E jermaChomp
He has to be a god gamer jermaJex
you have to clean it up first
dont forget to take a look at your inventory
just play a game and get the boots
you can go into the shop and buy a new one
I think you should buy a new camera
it's just a joke to distract us from the fact that you're a vampire
YOU CAN BUY MORE LEGS IN THE DAMN LAND
I would be so stressed if I was watching this
if you dont play anything good i will not sub to you
We know you're a bad guy, but what's the point of this?
you have to do all the jumps
why did you just fall down the stairs?
the carnival stream was a fucking disaster LUL
can you make your own character in this game?
theres a vr version of this game on steam
Why did you say that? It's a joke
you need a water bucket to clean the bucket
This is the most generic title I've ever heard
I've been watching you since you were like 6 years old
dont worry, it's just a game to entertain
I'm a middle school English major and I don't know how to pronounce it
I just want to see the Lord of the Rings vids
I think you should play a different game
Please tell me you have a million dollars in your bank account
I'm going to blow my brains out if you don't go live soon
this game was made for the Xbox 360
The one time I did that, I was fucking crushed by a fucking tarp
you can't be a vampire if you don't drink blood
you have to hold it to charge it
did you do the bomb game? :)
you should play the darksouls mod
This is the equivalent of a old lady getting in a car accident.
What if the streamer just doesn't want to stream
There are games you can do that aren't hard
it's a bit too late to play this
You know you're gonna be in trouble right now
You should go to a casino in Vegas, you could get like $600 for playing this game
you dont need to do this every stream
He's not a true gamer, he has a cold
you can upgrade your strength by throwing rocks
hey jerma i think you should play more of my level
You can use the bathroom with the chainsaw
i love how jerma985 is the only person with a sub
YOU CAN BUY MORE LEGS IN THE DAMN LAND
I think you need to get all of them
I think you need to get all of them

What is the point of having this game
do you have a twitch prime sub?
you have to save your ass to get the boots
they have a bunch of cool stuff
@Jer
====================
you can just look up the option menu
It's not a dream, it's a memory card
You need to make the exact same line every time
you can only win this one game
theres a way to get to the cave
Jerma would you rather play this or the game that came out a few days ago?
You were just making a comedy out of the stupid
why does the music just sound like you
you can actually see the menu button in the menu
you gotta get it in your head
I've seen this game before but I didn't get any bits
why would you want to play the game
why is there a "I'm not a boomer" sign on the wall?
You have to do the tutorial for the final boss
Do you still have the disc that you used to play this game?
I'm listening to the stream and you're just making a character and you're not even in the game.
you have to do the tutorial again
Please just buy the game in its current form
I think you need to restart the game
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THE N WORD
Jerma is not a REAL GAMER anymore
you need to keep dodging the axe attacks
jerma will you be playing this game for the rest of your life?
you can do it, it's called a "treat"

What is that black hole in the center of the sun?
You're not supposed to eat food in the desert
its a good game but its not good for stream
i didnt know this was a porn game
hey what is the game you're playing today
hey what is the name of this game?
jerma has gone from joel to jerma has gone from jeremy to jerma

This is a little too scary for me
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
you can't get a single hit on this mission
this is the equivalent to a war crime
you can use a mouse and keyboard combo to quickly type in chat.
you can give the controller to the nurse if you want
I just got here, what is this game?
your mom is a filthy liar jermaDisgust

jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I'M GONNA RISE UP, AND RISE FROM THE DEAD

@Jer
====================
I would hate to be that one guy
you're not a real streamer if you dont have a fake streamer account
i'm not even jerma anymore, i'm just a boomer
this game is just an ad for a game
I'm gonna be honest, this is my favorite stream of all time
Have you seen the new hot topic page on the subreddit for the game awards?
your mic is too low you're muted
What if the world is a wario ware?
I hate this game it's so bad LUL
This is the same game as the first one
It's the most recent game. It's so bad that it's not even funny
i think you can just kill the dog
I don't think this is how you do it
you are in the beginning of the stream
you need to use your ranged attack
this is the most satisfying thing to happen to a stream
I have to leave right now, please start over
Just go to the entrance of the house and go through the whole hall
I wish I was a mod FeelsBadMan
you could have done this one instead of building stuff
he's actually a danganronpa character, he's voiced by an actual character
i think you can still use the control stick
you're the one who died to pinwheel
You should make your own version of the Chibi Robo game
I am in no way related to anyone else
I just got here, what the hell is this game?
I want to see the entire house burn down
this is like the worst stream of the decade
i dont think it even gets close to the base game
You can't just get a sub and not get a gift sub
what if you got a lot of em
you should have been playing the game instead of watching the cutscene
jerma will you ever play the endgame ost
I don't know if you know that but I don't
i was really enjoying the stream but it was kinda boring
why is chat so fucking slow right now
that's the only way i can watch this stream
Jerma you can go to the other side of the map
The only way to defeat this boss is to use the arrow keys!
you can do it again and do it again
You're gonna get banned for streaming this
is it because you havent eaten in 3 days?
this game was made by the same people who made sims
I wanna see the feet and hair on this
this is what happens when you dont play good games
I've got a feeling this is gonna be a good one
I think you can just kill the dog if you want
i wish i was a mod FeelsBadMan
he's gonna do the next stream right now
Jerma do you have a son or daughter?
You know what, I'm not a fan of the current one.
you can do it if you're good at the game
Are you gonna stream Monster Hunter World again?
this is just a 5 hour cooking stream
I've had it on for hours, it's pretty good
Oh boy, this is gonna be a good one
The fact that the joke has lasted this long is really good
I feel like this is just a game for people who can't make games
do you know what a plow is?
this is like the dark souls of game shows
why is it that you just want to play the game
I can't believe jerma is still streaming this game LUL
you gotta play the game to unlock it
I will say that you are a pretty good streamer.
it was a joke, but it was funny
did you see the new 3rd jerma video?
im going to pay you to play the game
Jerma I'm gonna be so mad if you don't stream today
jermaOld Back in my day we had to go to the bathroom
when you're doing a speech, what kind of car do you use to drive?
I bet you guys can't even play this game
You can use the arrow keys to move around
i can't believe jerma is a genius at this game
I was about to say "LUL " but then I realized that's a lot of words
it's because of the fucking suicide train joke
you have to level up your character
you can do it, you just
====================
when you get a real gun and you shoot the guy, that's when you get the real gun
What's that noise you're making? I'm trying to make a noise.
what if you got a bomb and then got hit by a car
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 10 YEARS
YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 10 YEARS
I DON'T KNOW I JUST WANT TO WATCH THE VOD
The dev is working on the DLC for this game, they've been asking for an update
the sun is gonna fall on you FeelsBadMan
please get the boots. they are worth it
You can just use the cheat to skip the level
you should make a stream where you just sit in chat and do nothing
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaEarth jermaMerc jermaMoon jermaSaturn jermaSun
It's like a kid who got the toothpick and a stick
i like how he's having a little smile and then suddenly he's naked
go to the left machine, there is a button
Jerma you're getting closer to the end of the game
just beat the game you're not going to stop now
It's like the voice actor for the first two actors
you dont even have to do the puzzles, its just a waypoint
Did you watch the new Mario movie?
there is a new version of this game on the gamecube
that is a very weird way to say "suck"
i have to pee, can you pause the stream for like 20 minutes?
if you want to talk about politics just say something really controversial and get a response from it
this is the best game on the gamecube
I hate how you've never been to a public library
it's like a kid who got the toothpick and a stick
you should play that one new pokemon game
Play it, you can do it :)
you can change the settings to show the vod
Just put the hat on, you don't need it
This is the one time you're gonna get it
he just got a knife from the food
This is gonna be the stream of the year
imagine not being able to watch the stream LUL
You can't tell me what to do :)
I WANT TO SEE A LITTLE PINK
This is the worst game I've ever seen

If you do a flip through the dino's cage
YOU NEED TO START A NEW GAME
it's because you're in the middle of the desert
You should've made a video on it. @Jerma985
i can't believe jerma is actually playing a game
I heard you were a big chronotrigger fan and loved Chrono Trigger, please play it!
Would you ever consider playing the original Dead Rising 2?
you can make your own from scratch in this game
What are you talking about it's gonna be 2 years of carnival games

I think the game is making you angry
jermaWalk the songs of the sick and the weak

my sister said she would buy you a vive if you did this
I'm going to listen to this music for hours
Is this the guy who couldn't beat the first level of the sims on stream?
yeah that makes sense. I'd be the first one to ask if it's a good game
I just got here and I'm already having a mental breakdown
Can you do the "I don't know" joke again?
The only thing I can do is stay awake to watch the streams and just pretend I'm playing
JERMA THIS IS YOUR MOTHER I NEED MY CRACK
jermaOld AHHHHHHH! I SEE A BLACK HOLE!
just play it on the ps4
you can get the boots to get the boots
I'm not even joking, you should probably just play the game
It's a really nice game, but you have to find the perfect ending
Jerma please, I'm begging you, play The Thing again.
hey Jerma can you get my dog?
you should have played the other 3 games
What the fuck do you even do
did jerma do the voice of the guy he's killing?
you know you can just say it.
he's just gonna go back to the first game
i just came back and i see a huge fucking lizard in the corner
you can't even get the boots in the first game
What's the funniest thing you've done so far?
I'm pretty sure you're on the wrong page
its ok jerma, just keep playing :)
just got here and i am already crying
You can use the 2nd arrow on your left controller
Is this the guy who couldn't beat the first level of Sekiro?
you need to do the dlc after this
can you do the "cute" voice for the next game
I can't believe Jerma is actually a furry
play the game how I want you to :)
you should put the stream up on your main page, that'll fix it
You can just copy and paste it if you want
How do you think he is going to do this?
why is there a full moon tonight jermaSun
What is the name of this game?
You can use the 2nd arrow on your left controller
This is the part where you get the boots
I hope you play more of this game
do you think you'll ever play a good shooter like CS:GO?
you have to do it in front of a mirror
you can do it in the woods with the tree
I'm gonna be honest, I've never played this game
i wonder if he is going to play the other 3 games
I got a lot of points for that one
I feel like I'm watching a Jerma Stream
why are you so good at making noises
its not a joke, its a fact
I'm so tired, can you just end the stream already?
if you dont do it again, im calling the police
how are you so bad at this game
would you rather be a turtle or a rat
i hope jerma plays the game on his ipad
just play the game and say its okay
they want you to think they're smarter than they are
i have a number of funko pops
YOU NEED TO GET ALL THE FEET TO GET THE GOLD
When are you going to play RE4?
can you put the webcam on the left side of the screen
LUL that was the best one ever OMEGALUL

You can't just say "what?" as a command
dont forget to pay the carnival money
"He was really nice" - Jerma in the flesh
how do you think he got the knife?
you have to go to the top of the mountain
I don't have the game, can you turn it on
I don't think you have a full body suit
so you're just gonna be streaming yourself eating a burger and then drop it in the toilet?
I bet he's gonna do the "grape soda" joke again
you just have to get the right gun
What if you fall out of the sky and die?
dude you need to go back to the first floor
Did you play this game for the whole stream?
you can do that in the katamari casino
Hey Jerma, I just wanted to say I appreciate your streams.
You can use the same keys to select a different car
why does this game have a really good music track?
dont worry you just made an ugly face
i think you can just buy a bigger body bag
I think you can do it in the menu
have you tried turning it off and on again?
I cant believe Jerma got the wrong game
can you make a fart joke with the buttons?
just play the game for the memes

I'm trying to get to sleep but I'm too lazy
I think you can just make a group of friends
i just got here is the stream over
I like how he says "fuck it" like he's a real streamer
the sound of your own voice is making me so fucking mad
you are a human being and that is why you are so good at this game
it's a good thing you don't have a girlfriend
you can't do this without the boots
the dude who made the rat movie LUL
you can get a business license if you get a business degree
i can't believe you just got on the stream
put it in the discord voice channel
I hope Jerma buys this game because of the green screen stream
I have a better idea than what you just said LUL
Are you gonna stream the new Animal Crossing when it comes out?
you can just do the DLC in the menu
you can just make a new character
it's not too late for you, it's too late for us
I think I'm gonna die this stream :)
It's an honest to god looking game.
I'm getting an ad for the game Jerma
I'm not gonna get that bit message out of my head LUL
"i know what's happening" is the only thing that matters
why is the nancy drew game a joke?
did you know that the left hand can rotate between a circle and a circle
You're not supposed to do that
I have no idea what's going on in this game
You can use the thumb to hold a weapon

theres a secret level if you get it
You know how to talk to the dragon?
Hey I have to go to bed, good night jermaHeart
I think you're in for a rough ride
this game is really good at bringing up the memes
You should play the new Super Mario Bros.
jermaWalk me and my gang heading to the grocery store jermaWalk
He should be in a recording studio recording the game
why do you have so many mods lol
You can only do one of the two, you need to do the other one
you have to go to the new area
you can also charge the shield with a charged sword
Are you going to play Death Stranding after the carnival?
I think we should just get a 24hr timer
you can take the sword with a charged sword
i cant wait for the spill joke of the stream
You're gonna get banned from Twitch, you're gonna get banned from the community
Please get the boots to get the boots
theres a secret room in the basement
theres not a single person in the world
you need to play the game again
jerma just kill the dragon to get the dragon's blood
i have a crush on you, just kidding
I'm gonna miss the stream so I'm gonna go watch some VODs
i can't believe jerma has a bad taste
hey guys jerma here, hows the game going?
what if i'm already here and I'm just here for the prestream chat
I bet you can't even beat the first part of Fellowship
You can just kill the other ones
I've been trying to get a job, I'm gonna finish my degree and have to work for it, so I'm trying to find a job
you have to open the door and then wait for the gate to open
the guy on the right has a damn head
I'm like 5 and I've never watched a stream
you need to save all of them before the end
i think we should get a 24 hour timer
why would you put the same thing in a vacuum
it looks like you're drinking from a bucket
they're not, they're called "baby" toys that have a toy
you need to build a new house
this is so sad do something else @Jerma985
JERMA I THINK YOU'RE IN A COMA
i think you're the only one who can do it
YOU CAN GET NEW BOOTS WITH THE DIFFERENT SKILLS
Are you going to play any other games?
oh man the new fortnite game looks pretty good
youre doing a great job, keep it up
it's because they're not a specific type of fish
get some water, we're drinking too much jermaSun
you're not a gamer if you play on the hardest difficulty, you're a gamer if you play on the hardest difficulty
this is the guy who died to pinwheel
if you do a tier list, we can vote
you can grab the barrels and use them to make your own oil
this guy beat dark souls on stream, he's a god
When are you gonna play the sequel to Clock Tower 3?
That's because you're not a real gamer, you're a fake gamer
you can use the boots to get in and out of the ring
this is the hardest level in the game
jerma you can just let go of the sword
I bet you can't beat the first part of Fellowship
I have a high school computer exam tomorrow
you can get a car with the mop
jerma can you put on some clown makeup please?
jerma your hair looks good today :) @Jerma985
you can throw it with the mop
what happened to the facecam, did he forget to put on the headset?
this is a fucking waste of time
I don't like this game, I want to go to bed
I'm not sure if you can say it, but you're the only streamer I've ever seen with a Twitch Prime membership that doesn't have a Twitch Prime Sub
====================
I've never been to a carnival but i sure do love watching jerma play the game
this is like when jerma has to do the phonecall on his own
jerma you just got a -2 from chat for not picking a good time to stream
so is jerma actually gonna do this for the next hour?
this is what happens when you dont turn your cam off
Dude I've got the cool item, I'm not even halfway done
he is in chat, he said he'd be live by tomorrow
i was gonna ask about the discord but i was afraid of the discord
we're not supposed to watch you play this game
I think you have to go back and get the boots
If you get the boots they will be worth it
Jerma you need to stop doing that stupid ass dance
Hey I'm just gonna say that the mic is fine but the game audio is fucking awful
hey jerma, what's your favorite kind of cheese?
You should try to find an NPC that can stand on them, you'll love it
he's going to be live in like 10 min
you don't have to do anything you know
you can get the boots by buying a bunch of stuff from the market and using them to move stuff around
it wasnt a lot of people, but it was a lot of people
it's a game where you play as a child
I'm still waiting for the 'joke' segment
I really want to see a Jerma985 playthrough
theres a lot of people here in chat that are pretty much morons and dumb
You're the one who took my wife, Jerma.
what if he's just a ghost, what if he's just a ghost?
That's a lot of money, that's a lot of money
this is just like that one kid who got a birthday party and forgot to turn the lights off
I don't think that's how the game works
my grandma was a firefighter, she died of a heart attack
i can't believe jerma is actually playing a game
We got the boots for free :)
the one in the corner is a hole
you know you can change the time in the settings
you can buy a lot of stuff from the market
i don't think jerma can make a good game without mods
jerma you need to beat this game now
You have to get the boots first
im a little old, i think you can beat this game on stream
i love the end of the stream music
I was gone for like an hour, and you're still streaming
you know how to make a bed?
you're just making your own characters, right?
i'm a doctor, and i'm pretty sure you don't need to do anything to diagnose your patients.
I'm sorry but I don't know what it is
he's not actually gonna play the game tomorrow, he's gonna stream
go to the town and buy a ton of stuff
It's not a porn game, but it's a porn game
you have to play the game LUL
i think you can make it really easy with the first level
You need to hit it for the credits
you just gave the dog food to feed his hunger
JERMA YOU WERE IN THE OTHER ONE, NOT THE OTHER ONE
The only way to get the boots is to beat the game
It's the same as that one game you played
I'm pretty sure the devs of this game just made this game
You can use your mouse to scroll the screen @Jerma985
is this the streamer that couldn't beat a kids game on stream?
oh my god, he doesn't know that the inside of his room smells like a sewer
this is like the one episode of spongebob where they kill spongebob and then just leave him
You can buy the boots from the market
How many more notes does it take to beat this
that's why you have to be in the water
if you dont make the joke jerma will kill you
i wonder what jerma is going to do with his new headphones
You have to do it with the bike
is this a bad joke or a good one
remember when you said you were gonna play the game tomorrow
I can't believe this guy is a fucking nec
====================
, you are the best one guy.
You can use it to unlock the secret boss
you said you were going to play some more games
It's not even 1am in Europe, it's 11:30am for me
i hope you have a good night jerma
this is the last time you're playing this game
so theres gonna be some sort of currency thing
you should play the long game like the old days
you should buy more funko pops, like the ones with the a button on them
I can't believe he's playing this all night
you're just gonna make more noise when you're actually in a car
You need to come back and play this game
so when does the hulk become the giant enemy spider
i wish jerma would play the song for this
theres a way to get to the top
Jerma is a funny voice actor, he's so genuine
what if we kissed in the jerma chat
you gotta go to the machine in the middle of the map
You just played a scary game, you should stop
you should have gotten the coin back
I just got here, is this game too scary for Jerma?
what do you think of the new Star Wars game?
You could've just watched the whole VOD and been there for like 2 hours
you can make your own jerma show
we know you want to play, but what's your plan?
I'm so glad I got here early to see this

You have to get all of the items first
I like how jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
It's going to be a lot of fun
if you play the other games with green screen vr
it's good, but you have to do it in the right order
I just got here, what the fuck is this
It's okay Jerma, I don't want to listen to you anymore

====================
you gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something, gotta do something
you have to play the game again, it's not fun anymore
I'm so glad I can finally catch a stream
That's the most authentic Jerma voice I've ever heard
I don't want to live in a world where Jerma is just a giant villager
I don't think the other team has a chance
THE MACHINES HAVE GONE TOO FAR INTO YOUR DICK
you have to use the kick to make it to the side
LUL I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks he's a legend

the controller is so fucking good jermaVenus jermaVenus
you can use the jump to go to the top right
jerma is a good person, and you're all just a figment of his delusions
i can't believe jerma is gonna play picross with joel
imagine if you were a 5 year old playing this
Theres a way to get the boots but it takes a lot of time
Jerma is going to be a Furry God.
i think you need to turn off the game audio
how much do i have to pay you to play my level
you got an extra hour to finish this level
you don't have to build it, just go to it and play it
Ster is an absolute monster, he can throw rocks
I hope you all have a good day tomorrow.

I'm gonna be honest, this is a lot more fun than I remember
I just got here. What's the story?

JERMA PLEASE PLAY THE GAME, YOU'RE MAKING THIS HAPPEN
he should be in a zoo :)
why is there a timer when he's dead
are you going to play the new resident evil 2 remake?
didnt jerma say he was going to finish the game on stream?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2712. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I can't believe Jerma is a gamer Kappa
just dont fight it is a pain in the ass
we have to make sure he doesnt play a game for more than 2 hours
i wanna see him get a haircut
you can buy weapons in this game, you can use them in the shop
This is like the first time I've seen Jerma's chat this late
you have to keep it on for a little bit
Jerma I'm so proud of you for not having a beard
jermaPluto can't wait for the 6 hour diaper check
You should play the game with the DIAGARETTES
He's gonna kill Santa with the ring monkaS
i'll have a field day with this one
How many minutes are in a day
You should go to the doctor and see if you have a heart attack or not
i'm so glad i'm not a sub jermaPluto
you can actually see the head on his head
Is this game on PC or are you playing on PS4?
I think you need to hit the door bell
jerma I'm telling you, you're not making it any easier
i think he's gonna die in the first hour

I feel
====================

can you just do the one minute joke again
it's a bit louder than the last one
can you do a stream where you just go to the bathroom and you just pee in the shower
Are you going to be playing some other games tonight?

I think you can hold shift to skip the cutscene
jermaChomp JERMA I HAD TO DO THE WORK
the guy who wrote that on his cover art for the new arc is in chat
i have like 10 dollars on me rn
it's a lot easier to just play it
you can get the boots if you do it at the end of the game
jerma i think you should go back to the beginning
you can eat the rat, but you cant eat the rat
you could just have done the tutorial and said "you can do it"
If you didn't have it you wouldn't have been able to afford it
why is the game so good? is it bad?
this is like a bad dream I have
the only reason they are all in the same place is because you're all in the same place
no, it's a good game but it's bad
I'll go ahead and assume that you've done this already
have you considered doing a cooking stream with etalyx
you're a fucking moron, you're just a dumbass
you have to use the blue coins to get the diamond, it has a chance to drop from the blue coins
You have to get the full space

I was born in a barn in 1775
i wonder how long he'll be playing this
the facecam in this game is so nice

Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
you can sell it for a lot of money
I'M SO MAD I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT A GHOST PEPPER IS
can you tell us a bedtime story please?
I just got here, can you do the green screen vid again?
theres a huge gap between the two, it's almost impossible
there's no way you're going to beat this game without the boots
jermaOld oh my god i have to play this on my switch
you can use a spear to get through walls
You can also turn off auto aim in the options
That's a good name for a Byeah, Jerma.
I remember when Jerma was like a kid
I'm going to go sleep, good night chat jermaHeart

====================
jermaPain jermaJex2 you shoulda played that one more time
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer die
Jerma has to clean up the blood on the table
This is the last time I've ever seen Jerma
if you're a streamer you have to play one of the best games on the entire platform
the chad streamer is dead and this is his stream
i wish i had a sub to sub to jerma
he was going to do the double jump on the red jump
That's why we make you a mod

it takes like 5 hours to complete a level
what if you die and the world ends
i just want to know what it is jermaPluto

i like to get my water filtered with my feet :)
i think you can only run one of these
this guy is just a straight up psycho
The 1st level of this game is just a maze
I don't know what any of this is
You can't just put in an hour and still be late
You are now listening to â€œJerma is Madâ€ by Neil Cicirega

you can sell the other guy for a lot of money
you need to go in the other direction
I would donate like $5 if you played the other one
Jerma you missed the "secret boss" in the other area

you can also save and quit
jerma do you know what a penis looks like?
I've never seen someone so mad at a game

I just joined, is this the streamer that's been playing a lot of sims since 2015?
I just got here, is this game just for rats?
You have to hold R to use the x
why did you put the camera in the middle of the room
why do you look like a serial killer
This is the best thing I have ever seen
that's not the same as that one time you gave a guy a toothpick and he was fucking dead
I'm just gonna stick a potato in my eyes and say it's a potato
Why do you always keep your mic muted?

I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
why do you have a "chill" mode on?
Can you please play the rest of the game?
i think you can just talk to the boss right?
That's not the whole story, just the overall plot
This is the only way to get to the boss
this is the only way to get to the boss fight
put your face on the map @Jerma985
please do a stream where you talk about how you are the worst streamer on twitch
You need to find the right person to find him
You can play as many characters as you want.
You can't just say "I'm good"
jerma can you say youre not a fucking idiot
This game is like 20 years old and still fun
make a new save file for this game
It's true, you are a GAMER. It's time to put your gamer license away
you can use it to break the plate
What the hell is this game, I can't understand it

you got a lot of tickets to go to the other one
what if there is a way to do this?
youre just saying that because the water is in the middle of the lake
you're the only one that can do this
you're not gonna be able to play this game for the next hour
I hope Jerma makes a good stream this year
I like how this game is just going to be a mess
I'm going to play the game tomorrow :)
I can't wait to see Jerma in the bathtub
I can't believe Jerma's playing an actual anime game
if you're a weenie you'll be banned from twitch for a week
chat's going so fast nobody will see im gay
so we're gonna have to wait an hour to get a new one
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -206. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.

LUL why would they show the game on tv?
you can have a lot of my stuff
This game has a lot of levels, but they aren't very interesting
LUL he didn't want to spend time with us
i'm so sorry jerma you're going to regret that
you can't say it because you're a fuckin idiot
you should go to the doctor, you're too old for this game

you're going to get the boots, just keep them
you know what jerma? i'm gonna go on a rant about this game
That's a bit high i'm sure of it
What is your opinion on the new Xbox?

Do you know how to use the xbox 360 controller?
i think this game is very chill and relaxing
You can press the enter key for a secret

I think you're not supposed to read it
i'm like that but I hate that one
I'm a doctor, I'm not gonna do that
this is the end of the game
you can press the enter key for a secret
i thought this was a live stream jermaPluto

it was the best bit of the stream
this game is like 20 years old

I just got here. What the hell is going on?
you can turn it back on by pressing the dpad
is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
You have to get the next level first

You can see the dentures in the bottom right
You can open the door and let the cat out of the cage
make a new character that has a bunch of characters and is just a shitty knockoff of yourself
this is the best stream i have ever seen
you should be able to say "come in my butt boys" in a very angry tone
I'm glad you're playing this game, I hope you enjoy it
Oh god I'm gonna have to take a shower
you're literally saying that you are doing it wrong
What the fuck is wrong with you
you can move the circle to make a square
you dont need to do it all again
you can turn it back on and get the next level
You can use the xbox controller to make it easier
LUL why did they make a game based on this game

"That's a lot of money" -Jerma, 5/10 Stream

I'm sorry guys, Jerma has a problem with his chat
just take the bullet and shoot it
====================
how many times have you been timed out?
What do you do for a living, you're in a coma
Jerma you can't just say that you know
you can find a way to put a camera in the closet
I'm so glad you're playing this :)

I'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce the word
It's the same thing with the worst hair
you can buy a new one now
i'm so glad you're not streaming tonight :)
Why do you hate the game so much?
There is a crafting system in this game
jermaDisgust You need to wake up, your family misses you

I'm gonna take a shower. It's gonna be alright.
you can give it to a friend
i dont know what that is but it's an e-clown
Jerma when are you going to play the new Animal Crossing?
you have to do all this in a single room
I'm a huge fan of the new Animal Crossing
do you have the pikachu socks from when you were like 15
is it true that you like the smell of your own pee?
THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR HOUSE, THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR HOUSE
i can't wait for the first person to beat this game in one go
I bet you can't even beat the final boss in this game
You have to be at least 5 feet tall
You can't make a crafting table in this game
do you remember the time you played this game
Jerma, you need to do a full playthrough of this game
theres a lot of custom music, this is just a test
you can't just say "No" to a situation
i bet you cant even get the boots
I like how you can't get the boots
you are going to lose to a zombie
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not even sure what's going on
he is going to accidentally shoot himself jermaPluto
"Gabe the Giant" is the best name ever

jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
jerma is only here because of the wink
you can make one of the faces with a flashlight
you have to win it on expert to win
Why are you trying to make the same noise over and over
JERMA YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
he's gonna get mad if he doesn't see the face cam
this is like a fucking fever dream LUL
please tell me you have a good day tomorrow
You can't just say it on the spot
I'm gonna have to leave, you're on the verge of tears
I have to go to sleep now, good night everyone
Jerma, it's time to go, we're all tired from work.
jermaOld this is the way to play, old man
can you just go into the menu and click the pickup icon on the right?
Hey jerma, can you do a joke where you have a dick in your mouth and then you say "Hi"
Hey guys, Jerma here, I just wanted to say that I love you all, and I'm going to play some more of the Dragon Quest series soon, so thanks for all the laughs and laughs.
I think the whole thing was just a stunt
you can make one of the faces with a flashlight
i would watch you play minecraft for 5 hours
What if the mic is just a bunch of rats?
What's the worst you can do when it comes to drugs?
that's just the face cam from the dreamcast game
you don't have to do the secret boss, you can just get the boots

I heard that you can get a free copy of the new smash game on the 3rd
I just realized there's a goth girl in this game

you can only use the splitter for a few seconds
Is he trying to get to the last room
we just watched a movie, how much did you pay for it?
you can make a small house out of the ground and put it on the right side
jermaSun HEY GAMERS WHEN IS SAM AND MAX SEASON 3?

when will you play the game "Livestream"?
you know, i'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
if you play fortnite with chat, i'm sure we'll be able to talk in pre-stream
The vroomer is a bit scary, but it's not that scary
Jerma you just told me you were done with it
you have to do the green screen in the next room
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
i think you have to turn the music down

You can't just ignore that one guy
this is the most epic moment of my life
you are the only one that gets to play with this
we're all gonna be here for a while
i mean, it's not even a real game
it's a joke you made in chat
you need to get the boots to see the dark side
that's a good point, you could do the same thing in the future
you dont need to win the game
I had to get a new mic jermaPluto
You can get a free copy of the new smash bros game on the 3rd
he needs the old one to be fixed
I can see why you wouldn't want to play that with Joel
Did you see the new TF2 map?
I'm gonna make a video on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NxnHWdWg-8
That's because you have to run the yellow lights
Can we get a gf in chat for the main character of this game

what if we kissed in the rain ðŸ˜³
You can just stop playing and play if you want

the first one was the best one, but then the second was just bad
you should have put the jer
====================
i have like 5 hours left and im not sure how to do it
You can get a new memory card for 3 dollars
theres a bunch of people who actually do the thing
I think you are the only one who has to do this
so the only thing you can do is not to use the bathroom
I feel like you have a lot to answer about your height
You're not supposed to say it, you're supposed to say "Oh hey"
it's not even that hard to beat the game
I would go to sleep if you didn't stream tonight
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
Jerma you are like a 5'5" person.
JERMA THE MEME IS BANNED FROM YOUR TWITCH CHANNEL
this is gonna be a good one OMEGALUL
YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE THE FISHING SONG
theres a new map in the game you missed it
I've seen people get stuck on this part
just because you can't hear the game doesn't mean you can't have fun
You've been in a coma for 5 years.
why are you playing this game? LUL
I thought you said you were going to play Dragon's Dogma
you need to stop saying it in chat
this is the most wholesome thing ive ever heard
This game is actually pretty good, you should play it
can't wait for him to get to the rock
jermaWalk LET'S GO, THE FASTEST WE CAN GET OURSELVES OURSELVES jermaWalk
Theres a new map in the game you missed it
you dont have to press the button
you know what they say about a man with a bad name
I am not the one who does that
this is what you get for not using the bathroom
Why does this game have an entire tutorial
I love how the first thing you hear when you wake up is a "oh shit" from a monkey
I don't even know what a C is
will you ever do a stream with the wii
If you keep putting the "jerma" in between the two of you it's gonna make it look weird
why do you have an eye for detail
can you be honest with us chat, do you have a history of allergies
HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO BE IN THE BATHROOM
you have to buy all the ingredients first
That's why you're playing this game. You're a gamer.
you can still finish the game with the boots
Is this the streamer who has a mental breakdown on stream?
You've been in a coma for 5 years.
do a stream where you try to stay sane
Dude if you dont buy the boots you wont play this game
What is this "Filler test" shit? I expect something better next time.
are you going to play the new minecraft update?
Did you know that there is a game called "Yacht" that has a sequel called "Yacht 2
jerma you are a fucking idiot boomer
what the hell is going on in this game
its just a thing on your screen LUL
please play the game, you need to learn it
I have to go to bed, you can finish the level by going to sleep
you can also play with the dildo gun
You're gonna get banned from twitch for being an adult
just because it is a game doesn't mean you have to do it every time
there is a better way to say "poop"
we shouldnt be playing this game anymore jerma
jerma if you just do that you will never have a problem
what about the other guy in the room?
this is why you dont have a family
do you know what a vroomer is?
i don't know why i'm so confused by this
have you seen the new pinapple video?
you can do the mini quest in this

I'm so happy you're playing this game, you're the only one that's good at it.
this is what you get for not having a level
You don't need
====================
it was a joke, he was being a bit
the second you die you lose all your inventory
I just came back from a long day of work and I'm so tired of this game
i cant believe jerma is going to play RE2 remake
theres no point in playing this game without a controller
You need to tell us about your secret to get in
I was so confused when he started talking about pee pee poo poo
you're not even halfway done, you've been in the shower for an hour
its not even a joke, its a fact
it's a fact that the US is actually a country
I love you and your stream <3
you can get a free copy of the game if you go to the store
Theres a reason you don't like it so much
oh my god he's gonna have so much trouble
theres a save point in the cave
why is the voice actor in this game so bad
i wish he'd play more heroes of might and magic
you just gave a new meaning to "pizza worm"
oh shit i had to rewatch the whole stream
I'm here for the best stream of the decade, jerma!
you can do it again and get an ANOTHER
you need to be high to play this game
Do a stream of just you and chat
You need to do a surgery on your head
I think you can't get to the last level without the boots
do you know how many points you can get?
you got your hair cut at the end of the stream
if you're a good guy, then go to the restaurant
when are you going to play Sam and Max season 3?
you should stop streaming and play games instead
you can do it if you make a donation
you're playing on a shitty xbox 360 controller
if you do it again i'll unsub
do you have a favorite ice cream flavor?
you can check the top of the page
Why do you look like a sicko?
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE DOG CHAT
I'm gonna go make coffee and get you some coffee
You're not going to get all the money
Just put them in a box and let them die
i've been there before but this is the first time i've ever been in this room
the other people are just trying to be nice
you can make a deck with the pawns
I bet heâ€™ll get lost in the basement
you can play as any character in the game, you can even have a character as a boss
You know you're not supposed to eat food, right?
jerma, you can't just say the word "poo" like that
this is what happens when you don't play
why are you using a shitty picture of a person?
How much did he pay you to not die?
is this the guy that was the best mario maker player on stream?
You have to go to the store and buy a new one
LMAO JERMA YOU THINK I'M A FUCKING NERD
Why is there a sound effect when you're dying?
this guy thinks he's a guy who's good at video games LUL
This is gonna be a good joke PogChamp
theres a secret level in the cave @Jerma985
you can use the map to find your way back to the start
just play the game, it's not that hard
i think its time for you to stop playing this game
you should get the boots for the boots
can you say that the blood in the sink is so much better than the blood in the kitchen?
I'll send you a clip of the carnival stream
if you were a man you'd be named Jeremy
you have to sell the house to get a raise
I love your streams, keep up the good work <3
i can't believe you died to pinwheel
You can make a deck with the pawns
he's not even halfway done, you can make him fight any character in the game
Did you see the new T
====================
I'm gonna go to bed now. Bye jermaHeart
I'm so sorry Jerma, but I can't wait to see the new, improved Jerma986
how did you manage to be so bad
you could try the new star wars game
Why did you do this to us? @Jerma985
It's not like you're really going to miss anything.
you need to finish the game, you can't skip the first part
you would have been able to do it if you had just kept running at them
I'm getting tired of the same thing over and over
I will donate $50 if you do a Jerma voice
Have you ever considered playing Forma in a real game?
the last game was good, but not a good stream game
why did you do that, just like the other guys did
Is that the same guy who beat dark souls on stream?
I'm so tired of this fucking game
you can't be a detective, you're an arsonist
that was the best one, the other was pretty bad
i dont think you can beat this in the time it takes you to beat this game
go to the other side of the bridge
You could have just turned on the gas and been done by now
There's like 4 people here, what's the point of this
it's the new store layout, they don't have a dedicated store
please go back to the sewer room
I'm gonna need you to be in the game
are you going to play the entire game in one sitting?
I thought that was a good idea LUL
he's doing a lil bit of the regular game
I can't believe Jerma is the only one with a nokia in his name
just take a break and come back
Why is this game called "putt putt" in the dictionary?
The only time I get to watch a Jerma stream is when I'm stuck in the toilet.
you should play the brown note again
you are gonna get the bad ending if you dont finish this game
this game is actually pretty good for the time
It's a VR game and it's a lot of fun, just not really
put the scary part back on. it was too scary
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaComet jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaSaturn jermaEgg jermaGlue jermaPluto jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaEgg

You have to buy a new one every time
that's why you look like a the clint eastwood character
I can't believe Jerma is gonna kill Santa
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
If you do this again, I will donate $50
He's not gonna die to the easiest boss
just play the game, it's not hard
we need to get him to play more
you're gonna have a heart attack if you don't
you're gonna get 5 more frames of fail
You don't need to do the trick to get a free sub
play the game with the rat music
i thought it was a picture of a guy with a bad case of the flu
i think it's a lot better than the other one
have you ever played the original Borderlands
jerma can you make your own FMV game
I'm starting to think that the devs werent even real
Why are you wearing a backpack? LUL
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO READ IT LUL

I'm so glad you're playing this game
I will be the one guy for the next rumble

Jerma are you still on the toilet? I need to pee
you have to press the space bar to use it
That's what you get for not wearing a diaper
just like in the 90s, they had to make their own video game
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 985. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you have to click the spacebar to use it
He's the first one to die to pinwheel
hey jerma, can you show us the clip of your death?
you can go to the far left and go to the other town
I think it's a reference to the mr x
that's the only way to win you need to be able to put your head in the air
You could have just told them to not talk to you
If you did that you would have won
do you have the funny voice clip
this is a big way of getting money
what's the point of this if you don't know what's going on
Just admit you're not enjoying it enough to not say it
jerma you just got 5 stars in the dictionary
is this the streamer that beat jump king?
did you get that $60,000 to play a game called Mario Tennis
the music is making it sound like you are in a room
how many fucking points to not get eaten

he's gonna do the "jojo" bit again
jerma you're like a 20 year old character in a video game
you need to play the free hulk game
you can do it, just not in a kitchen
you can't see the tickets they're just there
jerma you're gonna get like 8 different messages from this
you just have to add more text to the screen, theres nothing to see
You need to do a longer than normal voice
How are you so bad at this game?
play the game again please. you can beat this one
you have to get the other hand to shoot
Jerma what do you want to be when you grow up
your character looks like a 6 year old
Just got here, why are you playing a shitty game?
I'd have to have had my wink be a fuckup
you have to touch the spacebar to use it
YOU NEED TO BUY THE OTHER GUMMY GUMMY
i remember having this game as a kid
do you think you'll ever play the new Star Wars game?
you know what you have to do
It's a story about a old lady, they're getting divorced
You're really good at this game :)
this game is like 2 hours long @Jerma985
you can do this but you need to do the tutorial first
the other ones are better because you can see their faces
You have to make it to the end of the world
Dude, that is some fucked up shit right there
I love how the game was just playing jerma was going to make a joke and you had to make it like this
why is he so obsessed with this LUL
play a different game, this one is fun
Are you gonna play the new Animal Crossing?
what about the guy in the old one?
Just press the spacebar, you can do it in any order
you are going to regret that today
you can get the other hand with the d-pad
just go to the town and you'll get it
this is a lot of effort for a 5 year old
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -26
====================
:
Jerma, if you beat the level I'll eat my own ass
do a funny voice so i can get it
would you rather be a chad or a gamer?
I just got here, what is this shit
you have to go to the tavern and redeem it
you can turn the options off and on again
I'm pretty sure that's the only thing you can do
i have a test to answer today, thanks for the advice
i need to know the name of my favorite band
jermaPluto jermaPluto I have to deal with this
im still here but im getting flashbacks
you can buy a really nice tp for 100 bucks

I think it's time to get your attention
go to the water level and dig a hole you won't find in your house
i like how the audio is just half the music
He hasnt even been to the zoo yet
I'm gonna go play some games and see how I feel
theres a game called "The Thing" you can play
Hey, I'm new to Twitch. I'm not going to lie. I've never seen you in a stream before, and I'm not even a sub.
why do you think people want a full playthrough of this game?
I wish he'd just stop the stream before it gets really bad
this is the only way to win the game
Iâ€™m gonna go watch the VOD. Iâ€™ll see you guys later
I think you can still get it with a free trial
you know its not the game, you dont have to play it
Jerma the second you get into the car you have to use your other hand to get off the wheel
you can turn off the background when you die
its the same song as before, but they are different

this game is so good, i would play it every day

I can't believe this streamer is still playing this game
the japanese game, in my country, they only have a few hours in it
you can't get a giant army in this game
He's going to be playing a kids game for the next 20 years
I think you need to do a bit more of a story
use your two big arms to run
Jerma, I have a little something for you to play.
theres a game called "The Thing" it's really good
You have to go to the tavern and redeem it
this is just the new fallout all over again
This game is making me cry. I just want to go home.
I can't believe this is the guy that died to pinwheel
you need to unlock the new "Grown Manlet"
he will still be able to do it if he does it
the fact that you can get it in the right spot
jermaWalk I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH THIS, OKAY jermaWalk
You could have made it in the end

You're gonna die from an old ass assault rifle

What do you think about the new Animal Crossing?
JERMA MY FAMILY IS BUYING IT, IT'S LIKE 25 YEARS OLD

This is just the battle royal level
i think this is the best game in the series
I can't wait for the end of the stream
i was about to type that but forgot
you gotta go back to the main menu and look at options
how does it feel to be a fortnite streamer?
This is like the Dark Souls of video games
can you go back to the menu and look at options?
I love that the music is just a bunch of beats
He's gonna start the stream with some bad food
just put it in your mouth and spit it out
jermaWalk C O N S U M E jermaWalk
jermaVenus jermaVenus get out of the way jermaWalk
theres a new movie called "the true story of me and my dog"
why are you so bad at this game
I have to get my xbox 360
====================
I wish jerma was a real streamer :(
its a good thing he wasnt playing the first one
why is this game so fucked up LUL
i like how jerma only shows his feet
dude it's the sound of my heart beating
I'm going to bed, good night :)
you have to go back to the main menu
Jerma is the most popular streamer on twitch
imagine having a dog and being able to walk it
you can't just shoot them like that LUL
how much money does it take to get a sub?
you can make it as long as you want
do a quick cooking stream where you just make soup and cook it
guys, what if Jerma doesn't stream today jermaPluto
that was a nice bit of stream :)
Why are you wearing a diaper? LUL
That's why you have the best 2nd jerma
You can't have a huge army and a small army at the same time
you need to buy more houses for the bigger army
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is the easiest jermaJup3 jermaJup4
hey jerma can you pause the game i gotta go pee
It's like they got rid of the old style in the game
jerma has to finish the first game LUL
i'm still waiting for the "Jerma has a crush on my dog" bit
He's going to die of old age by the time he's 85
you're not even halfway done, just beat the game
that's a really good joke, but it's not going to be funny
I'm glad that you're doing a good job. I feel so betrayed.
I think you're just not a real gamer.
what if you just do a whole playthrough of the game and you're bad at it
you just made a kid cry and throw the football
you can go to the planet after you kill the ape
I think Jerma will have a mental breakdown in 5 minutes
"i'm so sorry, I can't get to this part"
if you want to have fun with the game you need to play with your friends
just look at the green screen video
this is the best stream of the year
imagine being in a place with high winds and a 20% mortality rate
If you die in the game you die in real life
This guy's a god gamer, you should know this
he is gonna die in the end
i feel like im having a fever dream
that was a nice bit of stream :)
I know, he said he was gonna play it today
if you dont stream i will delete your channel
I like how jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
you got that guy in your pocket jerma
jerma has been live for a few hours
is this the streamer that was supposed to be live?
I just got here and I'm already confused
i think you need to turn down the difficulty
I don't think this is a good idea
Jerma is really fucking with the stream right now
i dont even remember what this game was
i just got here what the fuck is happening
I'm going to have to go to sleep now
I'm going to sleep, Jerma, thanks for the stream
i hope jerma streams another game again this week
you know i'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
if you want to see a god just ask her
he's going to die in the first hour
I thought this was supposed to be a relaxing stream
dont tell him about the secret ending
can you please get the fuck out of the way
they were trying to teach the lessons, but the teacher was a pervert
I'm actually pretty sure he's gonna get a lil bored
I'm going to bed, Jerma, goodnight everyone <3
you know what they say about a good streamer?
i've never played a video game in my life
its not a bot, its a game jermaIQ
you have to do a full inventory on the last mission
Hey Jerma I have to go to work, can you pause the game?
I just got here why are you playing a mobile game
Jerma please I'm trying to watch the VOD
i don't think he has that many viewers
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
@Jer
====================
just saying, this stream is gonna be fun
why are you playing a fucking normal game
i wanna see a gta casino casino stream
If you beat this game I will gift 100 subs
i have a big ass cock :) I have a big ass cock :)
the same way the ukubu and otto streams
The whole stream is a dickhead joke to us
I'll take a bite of that sweet potato
you were supposed to be a gamer
I want to go to the barber shop and ask for the shave cream, I want to know if you're okay
is he not going to make it past the first boss?
you can go to the restraunt with the jermacraft mod
What the fuck is this guy doing
I feel like this stream is supposed to be short
This is the same game as the first one
YOU NEED TO HAVE ADVISED ME YOU HAVE TO DO IT
JERMA IF YOU DONT PLAY IT YOU WILL LEAVE US ALONE
They're called Gnomes. They're a group of men who have an affinity for sunlight and love.
hey jerma you should go to the bathroom
jerma im trying to sleep can you wait till the next time I wake up
is this the streamer that said they were going to play the Mario Tennis game?
You can't just say that, you'll be banned from Twitch
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA, WE NEED TO GO HOME
they just wanted to be in a relationship
play the game again i like that
I don't know what you're talking about
Don't forget to buy the book to get the secret ending
it's not a painting, it's a report card
JERMA I HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR
this guy thinks he's just sitting in a room
get to the top right of the screen and click the touchpad
you should just play the music, its really good
why is jerma playing the funny music? i dont understand
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys i got a secret jup jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I have a huge erection right now
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 8 YEARS
hey can you stop pretending to be bad at this game and just play it for a bit.
i have no idea whats going on LUL
I'm gonna send you a text message
I don't remember this game being this good
how do you not know the fbi
You can switch to a different character right click and select
you have to do the same thing again
You just had to make a staircase to the top
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ WHEN I SAY "REVENGE" YOU SAY "SOMEBTHING"
Jerma if you don't get the boots you'll never get to play ODAMA again
you just got a gift sub jermaVenus
Have you ever played the Sam and Max games?
PLEASE QUIT YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 8 YEARS
I'm not even sure that's how you do it
This is why you don't make a 3rdJerma video
i think this is the best game
Jerma is gonna lose it at this
you can turn off the stream if you want
I think you need to use the flashlight
you can put the plant on the ground
You have to beat it every time
You can just go to the sewer and wait for it to spawn
jermaPluto It's okay Jerma, I'm not old
this is a good game for you to play
you have to get the ball first
I'm getting a new laptop, should I get one?
Can you do the "play the game" voice?
I was hoping you'd say "I'm not gonna leave"
he just lost all of his money :(
PLEASE DO THE MACHINE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
you can get a better one in the shop
this is the most frustrating thing to do
you can see the per
====================
I have no idea what this game is about
I'm going to go play some TF2 right now
Why is there a camera on your left arm?
jerma is gonna become a streamer and do a live action rumble
are you gonna play more animal crossing?
I'm sure they will be happy too
The game is just a bunch of people trying to find a way to play
you know, i was wondering if you knew about it
you can play the same game every single time
the game said it was a trial and error
How do you know what you're doing wrong?
you can use your own money to buy stuff from the merchant
did jerma ever tell us that he hates streaming?
jerma I'm going to fucking die I can't watch this anymore
can you do a tuber voice please
this game is so stupid and boring i love it
It's like a shitty disney movie game
can you please stop streaming so i can watch the movie
can you please put on the bane voice?
you have to get the boots now
he's just trying to figure out what to do
you can see him swinging his axe at the other wall
Jerma you can put it in your mouth
i love how you have your webcam on
you have to make him wink a lot more often
I'm gonna go watch a streamer and make some sounds and come back to this
you can buy your own water filter from the dentist
I don't know if he's going to stream today but he's playing this
it's like a normal day in this game
this is what happens when you do the ninja run
Jerma I'm scared, why are you playing this game?
You can tell you're not very tall if you try to lift them
I'm a sick fuck, but I am also a sick fuck
you gotta get the boots to make the cutscene
I've got a friend, he's a scout :)
i think theres a way to get out of the cave
There's a save point in this level
you should do the voice acting for this game
jerma has the best audio in the game
I remember the first time I played this
I think you're gonna get the wrong impression
if he doesn't show up in 15 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
why do you have to do this to us
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, I'll see you guys tomorrow
Can you make the word "booger" into a word?
I am going to donate 1 million dollars
the rats are going to eat your ass
I'M GONNA WATCH IT AGAIN IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
why does everyone in this game look like they have a dog in their house
you can skip the tutorial if you want
I'm going to be the giant rat who makes all of the rules
This is the worst game ever made.
youre doing a great job, a GREAT JOOOB
HE CAN'T BEAT THIS GAME, HE'S A BAD JOOOB
I don't think you can do it
is this the streamer who killed his own brother on stream?
Jerma, you can't just let this happen to us.
what's the best way to get that candy?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 you can do this jup right now jermaJup3 jermaJup4
can't believe the guy that made the bot died
JERMA PLEASE STOP THIS IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE
You have to put the water filter in the pipe
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT
i love how you can just run past the dude and walk away
i feel like jerma is just going to start streaming anyways
The only thing that can make you hate this game is a shitty character
you can use the healing item to heal on the ground
why are you wearing a backpack? OMEGALUL
you can use the boots to get a chest
i hate this chat i want to go to bed
I think the voice actor for the narrator is on the intro of that movie
i remember when i was born, it was the first time i had a real job
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when you play too much jupiter
i mean you should see a doctor
we're all going to die in a couple
====================
I hope Jerma doesn't become a dad again :(
but you need to get the ring to level up
Jerma why do you always look so mad
can you please turn on facecam its really distracting
This is a good game, it's not good for stream
you can do a face reveal and then it'll be a face reveal
You're gonna have to play another game to figure this out
I feel like you can beat the game on stream
you can do a face reveal and then it'll be a face reveal
do you know what a borderlands III ending is?
you can do a face reveal and then it'll be a face reveal and then it'll be a face reveal
did you hear about the new Mario game?
you're gonna make the worst joke of 2020
is this the streamer that ate a shoe ON STREAM?
THEY COULDNT HANDLE A GAME LIKE THIS
when you die, you have to play Jump King again
I'm so glad you didn't read my bit message
The way you say it is the exact opposite of how you say it
he was trying to be cool but he was just being mean
i think you can still use the ring on your own
you could have just used the ring on the ringed tomb raider
he's not even wearing a hat you fraud
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaPluto jermaPluto
I can't believe he's not playing the game :(
jerma just throw the entire thing in the trash
You're in a mood. PLAY THE GAME
It's like you're taking a long walk in the woods
is this the guy who ate a shoe ON STREAM?
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
do you have a lot of money?
i cant wait for you to stream until you die
jerma do you like your farts smell like your toes
Iâ€™m so glad this is a stream :)
what if we kissed in the jerma chatroom ðŸ˜³
This is just a 12 hour adam sandler movie
I think you're gonna have to eat a bunch of McChickens to get enough dopamine
You have to put on the mask
Jerma, you're making me feel like a fucking idiot
This is the best thing I've ever seen
jerma has to be a true gamer now
I think this game is better than the last one
you need to have the shield on
can you play the entire game without dying?
It's not even the best stream of 2020
did you know you can actually beat the game in one try?
this is a good game, it's just not good for streaming
I'm surprised you didn't get a sub from the carnival stream
you have to take the ring to the tomb
Why is Jerma playing a kids game?
the only way to get a kidney is to get a kidney bone
jerma is actually a 6 year old now
I can see you beating up a fish and then do it again
you can do a face reveal and then you can do a face reveal
Why does the narrator sound like a momma voice
the boots help you move faster, you can't do that on the ground
HEY GUYS WELCOME TO JERMA985'S STREAM, HE'S GOT A BOOGER
I have a personal opinion on the current state of the stream
you're not even the top 10 streamer in the world
the more you drink the more you die
Do you have a snack box? i want to know what it is
i wouldnt want you to get the ring
you can do a face reveal and then it'll be a face reveal and you'll be fine
I remember when Jerma had a 100k channel point reward. I remember when he had a 100k channel point reward.
It's not like you're a sociopath, you're just a kid who likes to break things
PLEASE READ THE WINK DINKS WINKS ARE GAY
This is a good game, it's just not good for streaming
this is just a remake of a game
jerma how do you not know what a JUP is

====================
I hope Jerma is able to play with chat tonight
you know i am just a wee bit tilted right now
why is chat so mean to jerma? jermaPluto jermaPluto
if you did this you'd have a chance to win it
I'm sure he's not a wee bit tilted
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys look at this JUP jermaJup3 jermaJup4
what if you were to be born as a frog
You're gonna get banned from the discord too
just type !save if you want to see the game
you can go to the last page of the book
stop doing this and just play a relaxing game
Are you going to play Layers Of Fear 2?
Is this the streamer that beat Jevil first try?
I just got here, what's going on
jerma should play more of the old souls games
Jerma if youâ€™re reading this youâ€™ve been in a coma for almost 24 years now. Weâ€™re trying a new technique. We donâ€™t know where this message will end up in your dream, but we hope it works.
i remember when jerma had a mommy emotes
you are the only person in the whole world who can see this
you can't just ignore people that don't have a sub
i cant believe jerma is playing the best game ever made
you're the one that gets the crust from burger king
what's the deal with the sound of your voice?
you should go to the actual youtube video
if you were to play this game, what game would you play?
Jerma, I'm going to be your doctor for the next four days, I'm going to have to give birth to a fucking Jerma streamer.
this is like the shittiest stream ive ever seen
jermaSour jermaJex2 jermaOld jermaOld jermaPop jermaPain jermaMars jermaPluto jermaEarth jermaBld jermaMerc jermaJex2 jermaJex jermaNosewipe
this is like that one dream i had about jerma
why does jerma have so many soup cans
"I'm gonna open my mouth and eat it" - Jerma
jermaOld Hey guys remember me from like a year ago?
i was going to get a sub but im so tired
my friend who lives in the same house that jerma lives in
just look up "The Streamer" on your youtube channel
you can do it on the wiki page
you have to click the p for the p to do anything
why is there a bullet in the back of his head?
you should probably get the boots for this
you can make a game out of it
I wish I could get a refund for that
why are you still playing this game?
Oh my god he's still on the last level
its a scene from the movie
I'd like to see him play this game more
Hey Jerma, do you ever feel like you're playing a game too hard for your brain to enjoy?
I'm going to ask you to do a tier list of the best games ever made, and you can post yours in the poll
I dont think he knows what a sword is
i hate this guy im gonna beat him up
jerma please do the death stranding voice again
I'm so glad I got a sub this stream
if you type !save for the sake of future reference use it for a joke
Why are you so bad at this game
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's my birthday and I'm very excited
You need to use the shockwave and charge your attacks
is this the streamer that's going to die to pinwheel?
You have to watch it with your eyes closed
i hope jerma makes a good joke about "wasting my points"
jerma do you have any idea when the stream is gonna start?
your current FunnyPoint score is 788. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
what if you had a big board on the beach
Jerma if you get to the last part of this game you'll be able to do the whole game in one stream
i miss the old jerma that streamed for 13 hours straight
jerma please do a
====================
jermaWalk COME OUT AND PLAY THE VIVA PINATA jermaWalk
you should play the newest game, which is called The Surge, it's free on Steam and it's a good experience
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
you should try to get a gf
why is he using the longsword it's too short
That's not the case, I'm not even a fan
why are you always so mad at this game
You can press the button with the middle mouse button, it's useful
I'm going to watch this stream live on my phone while I'm gone.
this is a fuckin steam game and jerma is not playing it
You can use the sword to stab the enemies with it
he's not a real gamer, he's a fake one
I'm so happy I got this emote
are you gonna play the new animal crossing?
jerma is in the bathroom again jermaPluto
go to the start menu and open the menu
I'm watching your stream right now and you're STILL playing this?
i wish i had a sub i would get like $20 a month
the one time he's done this i was at the arcade
is that the one where he puts his dick in the toilet?
I just got here, what the fuck is this game
Do a kenshi stream where you play as a baby
you should try the "AsexualPride" emote, it's a bit weird
This is a good idea, chat, have fun :)
You have to be able to speak in both ways
Jerma you don't have to look at it. You can just click the screen.
is this the guy who beat pinwheel first try on stream?
This game is like a fever dream LUL
I'm a huge fan of the new Warhammer, Jerma
im surprised you're still playing this game
you could just run over people with your car
i'm glad jerma is playing this game i'm so excited for this
you are so good at this game
I think the game just doesnt care that much
my friend who lives in the same timezone as you has a similar issue
that's what a kid would say if they had a friend
You need to have a bunch of books
please just move the camera to the top left
Why are you wearing a backpack, Jeremy?
you have to buy a new one
Jerma is this game just a sims game?
I thought you were supposed to be tall
you need to do a backflip for the secret room
I love that Jerma is playing this game
why are you guys spamming the same shit again
Jerma, what is the best way to eat ass?
why is your keyboard so big? it would be more convenient to hold it in
im so glad i didnt get timed out for that
just get some cheap ass boots and pretend you're playing
The second one is a better game
if you get a second one you can get a third one
You can also use the spear to cut the enemies.
you can make up some real names in the game
but why do you have a cream pie
you have to press the buttons at the same time
how many minutes until you get to the last level?
This is the guy who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
the only way to win is not to play
I want to see him lose it LUL
the only one that matters is the game
it was a fun stream, good to see you again
you're going to be the first person to play this game
do you have any plans to do more community content night?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
that's the end of the stream voice
imagine if the game just randomly showed you the time you died

what if the first person to die on stream is you
"i'm not gonna hit my head" - Jerma
This is a good stream, good job!
you can use the spear to cut the
====================
You're the only one who's not going to play it
do you have any tips on how to get the biggest gold in the game?
you were like 30 when this came out
I've been watching for 5 hours and you still haven't found the cave
I cant believe you are playing this game
DONT READ THIS. you are now cursed. you must die.
You have to get the balls to win this game
it's an iphone, not a wii, it's a wii
how many times do we have to tell you this isnt a good game
you should go to the temple and train your audience
that's the most we can do to you
You should go to the next game and play the first one
How do I send a message without having to type it?
no one here has ever played this game
it would have been so much better if you just got a second hero
This is like a fallout 1 speedrun
what the fuck is the name of that song
do you know how many points to the second level?
You're going to get sick again if you don't get the boots
this is what happens when you dont watch jojo
put the game in the other tab
THEY ARE GONNA GET YOU, YOU DONT HAVE TO DIE
you have to get to the second level
you would have been like 30 when this came out
you can get a lot of money from it
Play the original Dead Rising 2 for the PS2
He's gonna be late for the stream PogChamp
there is a new twitch update, there's a new game called Dead Rising
i want to go to the bathroom right now
Just like he's going to play the PS1 version of Death Stranding
Jerma I'm going to tell my mother you made me choke on my water, please don't choke on my water
you can do a full playthrough of this game without cheats
jerma if you were a wolverine youd be named Jeremy
what happened to the link? i just got here
This game is so much more entertaining than any of these
do you know how to play Nancy Drew?
YOU WERE IN THE GAME FOR LIKE 2 HOURS
You need to look at the tree
You can do it in one try
Jerma, why do you only have one arm?
youre not even playing as the main character
I like how he's really good at this game
jerma i'm just curious if you're going to play Halo Reach
you need to eat more than one of these
I just got here, why is Jerma so short
I'm trying to get my head out of my ass
do you know what a human is
you gotta get more damage on the second hero
Can we get a fanart of you running around naked?
do you know what a dog is
why do you keep saying that this is too much for you
I'm in the middle of an arcade and I'm ready to win
I'm starting to think that this game is a bunch of Jimmy Neutron
i have a picture of your face on the bottom right
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
this is like a real survival horror game
He is the only one that has left
why do you only have one arm
I hate the way the fish is talking, it's just a fish
i can't wait to see how many people die in this game
jermaOld im trying to get to the future
I love that the doctor is just a generic soundboard
you should play the more popular games like dusk, dusk, and so on
hey jerma can you please sing the song for me
you have to get in the middle of the road to use the next one
YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRIPLE
you can do it in one try, but it takes a while
you can do it in one try, but it takes a while
why do you have to scream like that
It's okay to have a bad taste
what is this game and why is it bad
you can play games on the internet without getting scammed
it is, but you'll have to make sure
====================
I can't believe Jerma's stream will be the only thing that counts
that's not the way it works its not the way you play
The thing about this game is that you have to aim your guns at the zombies to kill them
I remember you saying that last week on the stream that you would play Starbound
did you watch the latest vid of the game?
SourPls IMAGINE NOT GETTING POOPIED BY A NICE NICE ASS BITCH
you need to get the other one
I swear to god, all this chat ever does is find the one person with the lowest IQ and copy paste whatever that brainded moron posts.
you can only see the top of the ship
you are so good at this game, so bad at playing
play the FEAR OST it's called "Crazy Fingers"
you can have a ton of people in the same room at once
can you do a backflip, it was the best one
what's the most embarrassing thing you've said?
its not like it's the only one :)
that was the first time he'd done that
I don't want you to play this
JERMA WAIT FOR THE DEV TO TAKE A SHIT
what if you take the ring out and rip it open and then rip it open again
it's like an 8 year old learning math
jermaWalk DREW CREW jermaWalk GET THIS GAME OUTTA HERE jermaWalk
You are too good at this game
I was going to go for a cheese noggin
Please don't use the ring on the cow, he's a literal toddler and can't do this.
do you know what a yolk is
do you have any plans to play any other games?
why does this guy keep making the same jokes over and over
jerma i am begging you to stop
they're not, they're called "jello" in the original version
this is the equivalent of a gay porn ad
remember to play "treat others with the same respect"
this is the hardest level in the game
I bet you can't even do it in one go
you should just play the new bingo card
oh my god this is gonna be a good stream
jerma has been live for a while and i dont know what to do
You don't need to do that, just press the control button on the controller
You have to go through the wall
I just got here, is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
"I love the silence of this place" -Jerma
you should get more heroes to level up your hero pool
It's okay Jerma, you're never too late to the party <3
I'm going to go get a drink.
I'm just glad you're playing this game, it's a nice relaxing game.
you can turn it off if you want
you should play this game for the whole stream
Are you going to play Black & White 2?
the little guy on the right is easier to hit with the sword
jermaJex jermaJex2 hey guys look at this big ass Jex
you can turn it off if you want
what happened to the last game? LUL
Do you have a second monitor in case you need to look at the third one?
It's only been 4 hours, he's already forgotten the game
I think you need to be in the right mindset to play this game
will you be streaming on Tuesday or week?
I bet jerma would like that game :)
this is the best game ever made LUL
I have to go to bed, please keep playing
do you know how much money you will have to donate to pay for this game?
are you gonna play the entire game?
oh my god i cant believe jerma is still streaming
this game is just a really good version of Darkwood
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
Jerma what would you say about the game being released in theaters?
@Jerma
====================
coats are in the house jerma
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel
this is a top down view of your character model
The only way to win is to not play
you should try the new "Robearto" remake, it's a really good game.
jermaFireman look at that fireman its burning jermaFireman
jermaJex jermaJex2 hey guys, I'm back! jermaJex jermaJex2
I'm gonna go eat dinner, good night chat jermaHeart
you should play more of this game
i have a boyfriend and i'm on the edge of my seat
you need to find a new hat
you can do it again with the old one
this is gonna be a long stream LUL
You should take a break from this game to catch up on the vods
theres a boss in the last level
I'm so glad I can be the giant rat who makes all of the rules
play dead rising 2 after this, that game is fun
have you ever played any of the classic star wars games?
your brain is in a fit of rage
oh fuck the game is gonna crash LUL
you have to stop being so gross
Just make a full jerma face and put it on a different one
your food is gonna get eaten by a shark
YOU CAN USE THE BOTTOM OF THE HAND TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF A CAR
have you tried the new nier? it's pretty similar
I think theres a lot of you in this chat
he has to be using the guide leash
im gonna go watch the vod to see if this is actually funny
This game is too scary for me, I'm too tired to watch it
I've been playing WoW since 2011, and I've only ever played 1.5 of them.
theres a way in to the house
you're not supposed to do that with your hands
you can't hold a slot after a slot machine
Is this the guy who died to Pinwheel on stream?
You need to find the right items to unlock the secret.
theres a dude on the left that says "WOO"
This is just the Hotline Miami of the Nancy Drew series
you don't need to keep your armor equipped, you can just use it
you know you have to do this to get the final boss
The mod for this game is really good
I have never heard of a game so bad that it has so good music
Jerma will you ever play Minecraft VR? :)
You're so fucking good at this game
I think you're really underestimating how much of a time crisis this game can be
Did you ever make it to the third floor?
please turn off the music it makes my ears hurt
put a firework on the gunner
you should have been able to get the last item from the pin level
i wanna see how it looks like now
you're really good at this game huh?
Jerma is a vampire. He likes to eat people
How many times has he fallen in the pool?
put on a video of someone driving by the city and use it to guide you
Please do a stream where you play as a monkey
WHY DIDNT YOU LEAVE THE GYM WITH A FUCKING TRUCK
he's not gonna beat it, he's gonna get it
i thought the first one was the best one
just got back from a trip to the dentist, is this the streamer that beat Pinwheel on stream?
this is the last of the trilogy
jerma i just got here and youre still playing this
you gotta go to the next room and turn it on
theres no way you're not still doing this
jerma you should probably get a different game
I have the same kind of feeling about this game
you can play a game that plays off the record. It's called "Dead Rising 2"
jerma, what if you had a water gun?
you can make the face on the wall bigger
you can make the face on the wall bigger by putting it on the table
you can go to the middle of the desert
this is just the ending
====================
doesnt like that guy's face
You can change it in the options
if you dont have a full inventory you can just click the save file
i can't believe you put the mic in the right spot
when I'm not looking at the screen it feels like I'm in a fever dream
you can change it in the options
so is it just me or does the stream go to 160p?
i just came back from dinner and jerma is still playing this
You can still come out and do it
remember when you said you were going to play this game?
Jerma if youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™ve been in coma for almost 20 years now. Weâ€™re trying a new technique. We donâ€™t know where this message will end up in your dream, but we hope it works.
You have to be at least 19 to buy the DLC
did jerma ever play the "The Office" movie?
so you're telling me that you have a friend who likes your stream
It's just that it's just bad
what the fuck are you talking about LUL
this is the only thing that makes sense
do you think that this game is gonna make you feel better about yourself?
This game is just a mess of a game
Can you make a 1 player runescape server?
i will never forgive you for that LUL
no i was just talking about how this game was boring
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM AFTER TALKING
When are you gonna play the next game?
I'm at work and I'm getting flashbacks of when Jerma ate a shoe on stream
You have to eat them, you have to eat the shell
I'm so glad you're playing this game, I'm really looking forward to the next game :)
theres a book called the "nights" of Gnome
i think you need to be in the suit
can you go back to playing this please
you should make a youtube video of it
i dont know what the fuck is happening but im watching this stream
you can turn it off in the options
I'm not a fan of the game, but this game is fucking awesome
you have to walk back and forth with them
I can't believe you'll be streaming for a few days
I'd like to ask you something, could you please explain to me why you're not playing the new Animal Crossing?
he's going to hit the wall again :(
I'm so sorry I didn't get to see this game
I don't think anyone will have that many funkos
I have a feeling it's gonna be a real problem
I can't believe Jerma is a meat boy
theres a video of the whole thing
I can't wait for the next day jermaVenus
you have to give it to the pig
I think you have to be able to talk
why did he move to the desert? LUL
this is like that time I did the lego dance
The last one I watched was the first time I saw it
That's the only way you can do it
jerma is going to be a week late
You have to do all the dialogue to get the treasure
You can turn it off in the options
I just got here, what's going on
This is why you should play a real game
he gave you a minute to build it
you're a true gamer, you're gonna need it
hey jerma can you stop playing this game and go back to a more peaceful place?
put the rock on the left side
im so glad i got here in time for the stream
This is a grim scene I see everywhere.
do you know how many people are dead in this game?
no, you're not even using the guns
its ok jerma i don't like your taste in music
why is your facecam so small? https://i.redd.it/qfj5u1x6q21.png
when you die you have to stream again
jerma what if you were to die and all of us had to pretend we died
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
i hate it when you throw the ball in the back of
====================
you can make the same weapon in another room
jerma you have to use the gun to kill the aliens
you should play the game with the controller you got
why are you using the worst voice acting ever
have you ever played the new resident evil?
You didn't get any, you just told everyone to leave
I just realized I can't watch this stream
this game is boring, just go to the kitchen
I can't believe he's not playing Nancy Drew jermaDisgust
this is going to be a huge mess
jerma has no idea what he is doing
i wish i could pay for this game
you just need to kill the guy with the gun
SourPls YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS SONG
I'm sorry but your life depends on it
you're a good streamer and you've helped me through some rough times
I'm on my phone and it's not working, you're getting an error.
Why did you choose the same fucking name every time you streamed
i have a son and a daughter named jeremy985
You're going to have to play a different game
you can make a single weapon in another room
JERMA, JUST TURN OFF THE GAME AND PLAY THE GAME
you can just look up the guide for the tutorial
i want to be in the front row but i have no idea what to do
I don't know what any of this means
can you do the official countdown from yesterday?
The only thing that could happen is that you'd be watching a live commentary of a live stream
What if you're reading this but not a book?
YOU WERE LIVID LIKE 2 HOURS AGO. THIS IS A NEW WORLD
you can do this with the dpad
he's like the stream's a full hour late
you can play as a frog and it's a death stranding stream
oh my god he's gonna miss the tutorial
i cant wait to see how this game turns out
We know you're a furry, we can tell you're not
You should play the new Animal Crossing everytime you play it
i dont know what to do with my life
what if you just make a bad joke and then immediately regret it and then get angry
You need to finish this in a couple of days
that was a lot of effort for the same sound mechanic as that boss
Can you explain the meaning of life
did you hear the news that one of the snipers got shot in the head?
I'm really surprised Jerma hasnt gone to jail yet
i feel like this is just jerma doing a voice for the whole game
you can have it auto kill after the last one
he's going to be here for like 3 hours
what about a train track in the garage
if you're going to play another game, play Nancy Drew instead
I'll be back in 30 minutes, guys. :)
Just jump off the edge of the cliff
i dont think the game knows youre on the edge of it
I'm gonna go to sleep, wake up, and you're still here
you can't get a license for this, you have to prove you own a copy of the game
i feel like im in the middle of a symphony
You just got out of your home prison
are you going to do any more of the 2ndJerma
Hey Jerma! I hope you're having a good day!
I like how the people are like "oh shit i didn't know that"
you have to get all the items to get the secret ending
can you do a relaxing stream please?
I wish I could afford a sub FeelsBadMan
can we have a new emote from the new game
you have to keep putting them in the way
i was wondering if you could play the new nancy drew game
I thought he was going to do the tutorial
i wish jerma would stream more often, he's too busy streaming
you can have it auto kill after the last one
you can have it auto kill after the last one
You're not going to get it, it's not going to work
this game is like the dark souls of ps2 games
this is the most boring game i have ever seen
@Jerma985
====================
I've seen people watch it before, but not for the gameplay
You can click on your character's name to see their stats
he's gonna make it out of the tree
You're a fake gamer. You're not even a real gamer.
why does this game have a full-screen game button
you're a fake gamer, you're not even a real gamer
I'm in the mood for a nice relaxing game
if you leave this level I'll go to bed
You should play the game from the start
I see you've done a lot of work on the character creator.
You're the only one playing the game right now
Oh boy I can't wait for the "Rope" stream
I think it's because you're not really a gamer
you are going to be in this game for the next 3 hours
Jerma you're getting mad at this game
use the cheat codes to unlock the secret
i bet you can get the boots jerma
if you do the voice over you can play like a true grannys accent
I've been here for the last hour
you know that you're gonna get the money
youre trying to find a place to put your dog
you can play it now, if you want
I think the game is more about the story than the gameplay
imagine having a kid to take care of LUL
can you just play a game instead of this
what if the ring is the secret to death?
you can keep going, you just have to wait
The only way to win is not to play
i want a one way ticket to the olympic games
you need to do the bit where you win an award, not the one where you lose
how many of you have done the "lose" joke
just wait for the demon to come back
you can just use the ring to send out a shockwave
i wasnt here for the carnival stream :(
you could make your own pizza out of that
play the game before i go to sleep
Is this how you treat your fans?
can you imagine if this was an actual game?
You should play that sound of the chicken
just play it off the record, its just for the cutscenes
we are all one guy now you know
just buy the game and stream it on the main channel
you can use the ring to send out a shockwave to your opponent and send it out to the crowd
put a door on the back of the house
Jerma you've been playing this game for 8 hours, you know what to do
Jerma it's not about the money, it's about the game
you know you can use the ring right?
do you have the jerma card or did he just give it to you
YOU NEED THE BOOTS FOR THE REAL ONE
that's the most boomer thing i've ever heard
jerma you have a whole new meaning for "me"
Can you please turn off the music
just go to the part where you go through the whole city
you can use the ring to send out a shockwave to your opponent and send it out to the crowd
how do i send jerma a sub? :)
this guy is a fucking psycho holy shit
you have to use the ring to send out a shockwave to your opponent
You can use the ring to send out a shockwave to your opponent and send it out to the crowd
This is the most realistic game in existence
stop saying that it's gonna hurt you
how is he not playing this game yet
This is just the Dark Souls of RPGs
What is that, the thing that makes a man bald?
you can just put a bunch of bits in there and send them to the crowd
i really hope they make a game with the carnival game
i dont think the stream is live yet
you need to do the cow quest
you should play the Sam and Max games
this is the funniest thing I've ever seen
You're really playing this game for an hour.
i have a wife, she has to give it to me
can you pause the game i gotta pee
you can use the ring to send out a shockwave to
====================
I think you should take a break and get some rest. You've been doing this for an hour
you should try to not get stuck in this game
oh i know, it's just a bunch of zombies
you need to get the boots to see the full story
you just have to dodge all the bullets
can you explain the lore for this game please
I don't know how to play this game but I love it
When are you going to play half life alyx?
I'm a professional chef and I've seen it
you have to have a controller plugged in
do a stream where you pretend you're playing a game
if you dont do it, i will sub and send you a sub
Are you gonna play the new Animal Crossing?
You're gonna lose your house to a racetrack
i think you can also get a refund on your card
you can run from the cops in the dungeon
if you're not careful, you might die
it's not about the money, it's about the game
will you do the Jerma Rumble on stream in the future?
put the burger in the microwave and just let it sit out for a while
you can go to the islands to find a fish
do a stream where you pretend you're playing a game
jermaPluto jerma will never be able to stream again
i think the top 3 are the ones that you know
Do you have any plans to play some more Vrchat?
Jerma's a bigger man than he has ever been.
if you beat it I'll donate $50
you got the boots, the boots are for the boots
i feel like you should be a teacher
I thought it was just you and me
You have to do the DLC first
what the fuck did i just walk into
theres a new character in this game called the rat
It's too late to do anything about it
What do you do for a living?
This is what happens when you're old enough to drink Jerma
Jerma you have to go through the hole in the wall
I think they're still working on this game
it's okay, you can just go back and get the boots
you can get a few if you don't want to deal with the kids
you can get the boots by talking to the dog
can you make it so you can see the sky in the corner
you can only teleport to the top of the tower
you just need to be really careful
You need to go to the secret room
jerma please get rid of the jup :(
Jerma's gonna get stuck in the bottom of the first level again
Is this the streamer that beat the first level of RDR2?
Jerma, you know you can't get any while you're playing this game, right?
You have to go through the hole in the wall
you can do this in real life but in the game
I know you're a fake gamer, but you can't fool me!
if you dont die in the next 24 hours you are legally allowed to leave
why is he so mad at the game
if you think about it, if you put your webcam over the mic and pretend to be streaming, you could be streaming a real game
you can use your special attack, it's called "sound effects"
i'm so glad you're finally playing this game
you need to play the new pokemon game
can you tell me a story about your old bones?
why does this game have the shitshow music?
you can turn it off in the settings
hey jerma can you make it to the next room
It's not even a bad joke, it's just a bad idea.
when will you be playing more wow?
you have to press B to do a jump
jerma, you know that's a lot of salt, right?
You should be able to beat this one without boots
It's okay, you just need to have the boots
you have to do the work of a cook
you can use
====================
i have no clue what you are talking about
you need to go to the church to get the red items
He just wanted to be a dad :(
jerma we are not here for the stream youre here for the game
how many channel points for you to play the good lord of the rings?
Can you do the "You're a god gamer" voice again
this is the worst version of that ever
you can just change the category in the settings
there is a map to the right of the town
It's just like an old rick and morty movie
I'm here for the stream and you're not even playing it
Hey Jeremy, if you ever need a friend, please consider joining my Discord, it's a great place to ask your questions, I'm always here for you
what is your opinion on pikachu socks?
you missed the dog, you have to kill it
Do you have a set date for the carnival stream?
It's like an old man trying to hide from his friends
I'm gonna go watch your stream when I'm done :)
why do you always say "I'm not gonna do this"
I have a bad feeling you're a bad streamer
jerma is the only streamer that can complete the game
this is the worst thing youve ever done
you arent even in the tutorial, youre just playing the game
did jerma get the burger yet or did he leave
Theres a hidden button on the right side of the table
i have a confession to make too jermaPluto
how many bits for you to play the game please
jerma you know that's a good idea?
I just want to watch you play this game
I can't wait for the jermaVenus emote that will be on screen for the whole stream
That's not the face you make when you eat ass
can you play the Hypnodrones OST please?
"guys he's not coming back" "he's been dead for a week"
it's like a movie about a homeless person
I love how they're just making the same voice every time
You just need to kill the boss
I have no idea what this is but i love it
I just got here. What is this "Jerma" shit?
Oh yeah, he played a little bit of Bloodborne.
i dont know how to do this part
I'm pretty sure you can't even do that
This is like a good game if you can't play it
jerma you got a bad case of the coronavirus
hey jerma you arent getting any more money
did you see the new update? you have to play it again
Jerma is actually the only one I know who can beat this level
I think you have to do a big bang
Can you turn the music down a little bit?
Oh my god I just realized there's a secret boss in this game
We don't want you to die D:
You know what they say, the more you know, the more you need to get the boots
Hey Jerma, when is the next community content night?
I'm watching the stream right now and I'm just wondering if I should go and watch the VOD
You know what they say, the more you know, the more you need the boots
I'm sorry, but this is a mental asylum
I remember when Jerma was a bean bag sonic
I miss when Jerma was a weirdo, he was the weirdo who said "What is this?!"
have you heard of the shitty internet joke?
You guys are all weirdos, but Jerma is weird
You are getting a lot of views on twitter right now
you have to do it in the same room as the other characters
Dude it's like a 2 year old game
you just made me laugh so hard I fucking choked
the secret boss in this game is the most boring thing
do you still have that water pistol?
I'm still waiting for the toilet paper
we're gonna hear that jerma you cant stop playing
just do what you did last time
Can you play the new Sims game?
how long do you have to play the sims to beat the game?
You have to
====================
E
is he going to play more dos games
It's a weird way to spell "show" Jerma, if you're not used to it
that's the only thing I can think of to say
i'm gonna start watching joel's streams right now and see how bad he is at them
What are your thoughts on the current climate situation
you should check out the trailer for the game
just came back from work. why is jerma still on this
is it true that you are wearing a diaper?
I hate when I am having a panic attack
jerma you dont have to listen to me
The game is just too good to be true
you need to make sure the actual director isn't in chat
I'm watching this on the toilet and my mind is melting
What is this "Ladies and Gentlemen" Game Jerma is playing?
is this a new emote or a new one?
just wait until you see the final boss
I'm playing this game and I'm already a boomer
Jerma you gotta stop the music you're making me sad
JERMA DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH YOUR NEW HAND
I'm so glad you are back here, I left for like an hour and you're still here?
This is like the last time Jerma was here.
i just got here is jerma still doing this
can you play the original Just Dance OST please :)
if you don't get the boots, you can't beat the game.
you just posted cringe, your going to lose subscriber
I'm gonna have a mental breakdown if you keep playing this
you gotta go to the top of the mountain
have you seen the new "Dry Rub" game?
he's going to be streaming in 20 mins
theres a big spider in your closet
Is this the new Jump King DLC?
I'm gonna go watch a vod and watch this stream
Can you turn the music up a bit?
i know you're a funny man but please stop being a psycho
You can use the bomb to get past the building
Jerma you need to get more money to play the game
The only thing I'm really excited for right now is the game
This is the best version of this game
you have to get to the part where the dog dies
jerma has a family of four and all of them are ugly
theres a guy in chat that is making this whole thing up
you dont have to cut every single piece of grass
so you're saying you have a bad taste in food?
i just got back, he's STILL in the tutorial?
when you get to the last boss fight
Oh my god you can't even hear the music
i thought this was the last game LUL
Why does he sound like a deaf person?
This is going to be a good stream
It's not a joke, it's a game Kappa
is this what you do in the real world
this is the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
you can make your own emotes by clicking on the main menu
jerma i love you but i need you to know that i know you can't stop playing this game
why did they put a box over your head?
You can use the pow to get past the building
they said it was gonna be a short joke
jerma you gotta get in the right mindset
this is like the 2nd worst game ive ever seen
The only reason you know how to use a gun is because you're in the movies.
Jerma you need to stop playing and play something else
You gotta put on the Spy Ring
that's the last time you saw the guy in the corner
what if you had to play the game again
you just have to say it now
i can't wait to see the ending of this game
What if you got hit by a car?
The real chat is in the pre-stream chat
He's so cool, he's doing the "lol" face
I'm going to pay you to not play this
hey remember when you said you would play the second one
do you have a copy of the second one?
its too late. we have to leave
youre the one who is having a
====================
 this is a good way to get your credit card number
You can only use the BTTV addon
i can't wait to see jerma's ass eating
i thought you said you were playing with ster today
you're the only person on the server who's still alive
You can only afford one pair of pants
it's not a lie, it's a fact @Jerma985
you could have just watched the entire VOD
put the movie in the game awards
It's a jpeg file, not a jpeg
you cant get it on your own OMEGALUL
you need to pick up the trident
YOURE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN GET IT RIGHT
I don't think this is a joke anymore
is that the same guy who's voice actor is in the sims 4?
this is what happens when you don't have the dlc
It's a real thing, but you never know
there's a new trailer for the game
he said he was gonna play it
we're all gonna be furries in like 5 years
It's been over 2 years, please wake up
I'll tell you what, I'm just the guy who's always late
I would love to see Jerma play the original Wii game
you can literally use the cheat engine to make it easier
jermaWalk LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO jermaWalk
Why is he playing this game as a man?

i love how you just have to make the exact same sound every time you get the chance
i was only here for the bits PepeHands
it's not like you have to go to the store
I hope you have a good time with your family, I know you are a little short but you look great
You're gonna be playing this for the rest of the night
JERMA PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP
You need to go to the graveyard
I am a very attractive girl and I'm a female
What was the first thing you saw at the supermarket?
jermaPluto i hope you don't get infected by the zombie
i like how the game isn't even real
you're just a sick kid with a family
Iâ€™m sorry to hear that you have to get through this
You need to find the man in the mirror
This is the worst thing I have ever seen
did you know there are spiders in the mouth?
i think theres a new streamer called "jerma985"
Do you ever think you'll ever play Half Life?
he doesnt know that theyre going to come
that's the sound of you running into the wall
I hate that he's not playing the game right now
You can't even win in a tutorial, you just have to not go into the sewer
I think you need to watch the entire VOD
you can go to the store and buy more
He's gonna do it in one hour PogChamp
you can watch the entire VOD later
you have to wait until the last minute
you can use the ice cube to make ice cubes :)
You can go to the store and buy more ice cubes
This game is way better than the first one
i like how they all have the same voice actor
you can make a whole pizza with that money
hey jerma, you know you have to buy a lot of stuff
HE'S GOING TO START A NEW GAME
you can also use the ice cube to make ice cubes
You know what's good for you? Eating healthy, right?
but you're not a baby, you're a grown man
You're a "Divus" character. You need to be a Divus to use it.
you're doing a great job. Thanks for streaming!
just buy a bunch of 4s, they are the best
I'm just here to support you, Jerma <3
You can use the ice cube to make ice cubes :)
are you still planning on playing the new Animal Crossing?
you can only use the ice cube to make ice cubes :)
jerma you can only get items in this game
what if this is the streamer who died to pinwheel
Jerma is gonna get banned for playing this game
you can see the outline of a man's dick in the bottom right
jerma just get a new house and move
you can see the outline of a man's dick in the bottom right
@Jerma
====================
you are a top tier streamer, you just need to not let your ego get to the level of youRS
I'm about to go to bed, goodnight chat jermaHeart
you're going to regret that if you keep going
you can check what item you've got in your inventory
you have to be at least 6'3" to be considered taller than you
I love how the game is so hard to understand
i hope jerma doesn't have any big brain problems, like how he can't play this game because he can't read chat
I hope Jerma plays the new Super Mario RPG
He's gonna get distracted and think he's playing a bad game
You can set it to enable/disable the Chat bubble
There's a clip of the voice changer
what about the new meme of the year?
I think you can just get the other items first
when is the last time you've played this game?
if you dont finish this game im unsubbing
when is the streamer gonna play a game
The sound of your breath can be heard
I think he was gonna try to get it to 0
jerma if you don't stream in the next 5 minutes I'm going to go to bed
will you ever play the new pokemon dlc?
i'm glad i came to this stream
you have to have a 7.5 on your SATURDAY
imagine being a sub and not being a mod
jermaWalk DREW CREW jermaWalk Clap Clap Clap jermaWalk
there's a mod that changes the UI so you have to look for stuff
you can download the demo from the discord
Why is the ground in a straight line?
how can you not like it, its got candy!
you're not going to play the rest of this game
you can stop pretending now jerma jermaHeart jermaHeart
Is this the guy who beat the tutorial on stream?
You have to make the village a slave
jermaOld let me take you to the wild ride
Just got here, what the fuck is this game
You don't have to move, just go there
can you just call the stream over and end it
can you turn the music down a bit
theres a mod that changes it to make you look like a gamer
Jerma you know what's wrong with you right?
It's an old trick, they don't go out of the way
im sorry, i meant to say jermaPluto
Jerma you can't get more points for this game
He's gonna die to the final boss of fellowship of the ring, so he can't be in the next jerma rumble
can you turn on the face cam so we can make fun of you
you can get the boots by the way
theres a mod that adds a new emote
You're gonna get a call from a doctor
this game is so much more fun than this
i dont know what that means but i will say it
this game is not fun when its not worth it
can we get a sub sound please
You're a pornstar, so you can't have an opinion
you gotta go back to the main menu
they say the game is worth it but theres no way you'll get the boots
I feel bad for the person who got banned
You gotta put some effort into your sentences
This is the best thing to come out of this stream
Jerma is gonna be so mad when he sees this
i heard jerma is going to be in a jerma rumble
it's not as if theres a lot of people here, they're all just here
i feel like the only thing that's wrong with this is that jerma doesn't know what a foreskin is
can you turn on face cam for us please :)
i'll get it on the wii but i don't want to pay for it
You can probably beat it in 30 seconds
do you think you'll ever play mario odyssey
is this the guy who beat the dlc on stream?
you can buy the boots by the way
you have to be at least 6'3" to be considered tall
i miss when this was a goldfish game jermaPluto
i
====================
this is one of those assasnap towns that is worth visiting
I'm glad you're having fun, I know you're a little bit tired but this is one of those things that makes you want to play more
If you just go around the city you'll get a lot of stuff
You have to do it in the right order
I've been here for 20 years and I still don't know what a mosquito is
hey jerma, could you tell me about the time you ate your mom's lipstick?
this is like a cooking game on its own
you can just make a random character, and then have them be your new character
Jerma, I'm so glad you're playing this game
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
i hope this is a good game to play
You can turn off the dialogue by right clicking the game.
The only one that matters is the number
they really added a new class to the army
you have to do it in the right order
You can also run in that game
You can get a lot of stuff from the shop
you gotta kill all the enemies first
I'm pretty sure you're playing this as a VR game
did you just get a sandwich, or is this game more like a game
Jerma I'm going to take a nap please wake me up when the stream starts jermaHeart
I'm gonna go watch the whole thing
there is a secret boss in this game
there is a secret boss in this game
please go to the house next to the portal
When are you gonna play Half Life?
i know what aesopo is but that doesnt mean it's right
jerma you should get a ds, its like 2 dollars
play the 2d platformers that came out
you can also make a mannequin to hide in
I'm not even sure if I can watch this stream now
That is a new game design, not a good one
I can't wait to see jerma play the first level of the game
You can just play the game in any direction
Jerma has gone insane, now he has to play the rest of the game
There's a new game in the works
i hope he has the bucket on too
I want to get off of this ride
what is this? is this the game that isnt as good?
I would rather watch a 3 year old streamer than this
hey just wanted to let you know that I am actually really enjoying the stream so far. Really really really enjoyed the game. :)
i think theres a secret boss in this game
There are a ton of games that are more about farming than just killing them
this is the best thing youve ever done
You need to play this game on a deeper level
you should try to get a new pc
I would love to see jerma play the new star wars game
you can't be an E-Clown in this game
jerma you're just wasting time by not streaming
why would you be upset if we were just a little bit quiet
Jerma is an alien he has no human body
you can get an autoclicker for the game
it's like you're trying to stream a movie
you should try to get to the end of the game
its not a gas mask it's a gas mask
please put a fence around the house
he didnt play the sekiro tutorial game, its fake
They are all very good for your first playthrough
I'm on the edge of my seat right now
this is gonna be the worst stream ever
what do you think of the new Star Wars movie?
You have to be in the right order
do you have to be an adult to watch the stream?
you should get a free ipod touch, it's really cool
I would love to get off that ride
I'm going to drink a whole bottle of wine
i love how the chat is just so funny now
if you like kenshi then this is your stream
theres a way to get to the end of the game without spending the entire game
how did they get the glueman shirt @Jerma985
you have to wait for the moon to align
HEY GUYS I'M G
====================
 is still good, the story is a little dated
why do you have to be so upset at a game being played?
You can't just say "I'm so sorry" and not play the game
do you think you'll ever play that other game called Team Fortress 2?
I can't believe jerma is gonna lose in a Rumble
this is the worst part of the game
Hey Jerma, remember when you told us you wanted to play the game?
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
theres a really good arcade version of this game
he doesnt have the stamina to do it
I'll see you at the end of this
If you die to pinwheel you will die to Pinwheel
you can just look up the ending on youtube
I have to go to work in like 15 minutes
you need to start with the 3rd game
I'm gonna cry if you don't play Doki Doki
jerma your hair is falling out again
I just got here what the hell is going on
stop talking about the game and play it :)
you have to get rid of the green guy
He's gonna play it all night and never play it again
I'm in the middle of a rollercoaster and this is the last I see of my ride
Jerma you're not a real gamer if you're not a real gamer
he was going to get the boots
you don't have to turn it off
I'm going to be here for the next 10 hours
I'm gonna start showering, we need to start showering jermaSun
the game is a total ripoff, it's just a different version of that
this game is making me cry my fucking ass
you can also get a grenade launcher for cheap
this is the worst thing ive ever seen
It's a bit harder than the other ones
it's the guy that gets into a car accident
you need to stop beating this game
you have to press the buttons at the same time
you have to press the buttons at the same time
do you know what a "knee" is
you can use it to get into the secret room
I remember when Jerma was a chad FeelsBadMan
it's a bingo card for the carnival stream
I love how the npc is just like the other ones LUL
This guy is gonna end up in the hospital
this is just a worse version of the rat song
You have to win it from the other side
get the boots, they are good for this one
this is the worst stream of the decade
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I AM A REAL GAMER jermaChomp ðŸ“£
I like how Jerma is playing this instead of doing all of the tutorials
just like my dad on the field...
I don't know, but I know Jerma is a real gamer
this is the worst stream of 2020 ever
LUL HE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S LIVING IN THE HOLE
you have to do the word "haha" now
I'm a grown man, this is my message
why did you just leave the fucking door open
You're a legend, you can do this in one try
the only time you can get hit is when you are in the air
if you die in the game you die in real life
jerma i dont know what you are talking about
he has to be in the other room
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA WAKE UP
He's gonna do it and then be done
he's gonna eat a raw egg and spill it all over his keyboard
how many times has that person been to a mcdonalds?
why are you still streaming when we told you to stop
This is why Jerma is so popular. He is a serial killer.
you can do it again later when you get the boots
I wish I could feel that jermaPluto
YOU COULD HAVE JUST BUILT THE SOUP
That's not a garden it's a ZOMBIE SOUP
This game is so fucking bad, why would you want to play it?
get a whole sleeve of oreos and eat them
The only
====================
I think you can just drink the water from the ground
Jerma I just got here what the hell is happening
HE'S GOING TO TURN THE SCREEN OFF AGAIN
I think this game is just a bunch of people making decisions
Why is chat so excited for the new Jerma Rumble?
They have more than enough content to make you happy
he didn't say he was gonna play it again jermaDisgust
YOU CAN TALK TO OTHER GIRLS IN THE TOWN ROOM
why is the audio so low compared to the vod
you need to eat more than one fruit
Just got here, what the fuck is this
I would love to see Jerma play the original Dead Space.
I want a new Jerma Rumble with the same title as the old one.
I was actually here for the last one.
you just lost to pinwheel in one of those
PLEASE PLAY THE RAT LEVELS YOU'RE THE BEST
you can see the arrows in the screen
I'll just have to go to the store and get a drink
why do you look like a character in a horror movie
I'm going to have to watch this stream
the more you talk about it the more I will
he's got a new mic, it's just a little louder
The only way to win is not to play
you should do a full playthrough of this game
I really hope Jerma plays Bloodborne on stream. It's a pretty cool game
you can't be bad at the game if you know what I mean
There is a very long explanation for why this is the case
i bet you like the only part of this game
You can see the empty space on the map, it is on the right side
You can see the empty space on the map
you have to hit the corner of it
how many points to see if you have the full picture?
You'd be surprised how many people die from this shit
I can't believe Jerma is playing an actual game
we are watching the first ever JERMA RUMBLE
is this a fever dream or a fever dream?
you're like a drunk but you're not drunk
just make a custom song from this song
Is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
you can make a character out of a frog
theyre trying to be the best but theyre gonna give you an iron lung
if you don't go to the top of the tower you're a DUMMY
I'm sorry, I can't believe you
If you want to be a good streamer do some tricks to get into a bowl
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
i'm not even playing the game. this is just my head exploding
you can see the empty space on the map, it is on the right side
Just to make sure I'm not the bad guy
they have to go to the basement
i think you can see the empty space on the map
How do you still have a girlfriend who is in your house?
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game jermaDisgust
how much did you pay for this?
can you put on some nice clothes? :)
he was a single dad who made multiple albums
the only thing you can do is use the damn ladder
You can get the car from the museum, but you're missing the ladder
don't forget to tell chat to stop hating on you, Jerma!
you have to get to the top of it
Why are you playing this game? it's so boring
You're a handsome man, don't listen to them.
if you're good at something never do it for free
I don't think Jerma knows what a real doctor is
I'm going to be honest I don't even know what a dentist is
i'm not getting that sick feeling in my ass
how do you make your own oil
this is a good bit, it's good
You can hear the empty space on the map
It's because they're all about the coins
I'm gonna go watch the vod now, thanks for the gold
I'm gonna go eat a chicken and I'll be back later
you
====================
this is like a game where you're a kid
i cant wait for the vod of jerma crying
you can throw it at the wall
do you remember that one episode of spongebob where they take a guy to the hospital and they have to do this for 12 weeks
I'm gonna turn on the stream, this is gonna be a good stream
jerma i think you got the wrong door
remember to bring your own sleeping bags
The one at the top right shows how much you spent on it
would you ever play the new mario rpg?
I think you can get a lot of good deals on it
you can skip the dialogue if you click the arrow on your screen
what if you arent wearing clothes and you dont want to see me jermaPluto
I have no clue what you're talking about
can you turn the music down i'm trying to sleep
I'm going to tell my parents about this
i think you need to keep playing the game
JERMA YOU'RE A GOD DAMN GAMER DON'T LET IT GET TO YOUR HEAD
you can throw it at the wall
you have to save them now LUL
If you keep it up, it'll be the first stream of the night
use the blue pill to fix your internet
I swear all this chat ever does is pick the one idiot with the lowest IQ and copy whatever that braindead moron types.
put the white line in the middle of the screen
I was in a car crash and my car broke down and I got stuck in the bathroom
If you had a million dollars to make a Jerma game you would make a good one
why is jerma talking to himself in the corner
you can just throw it at the wall
the left one looks more interesting than the right one
he has a keyboard and mouse he has to play this
jerma is the guy who can't even play games on stream
jerma, you're making me feel bad for you
you can put the pan on top of the pan
just came back, where the fuck is the game
jerma is playing the same game as yesterday
jermaPluto he didn't win the game, he just lost
can you turn the music down im trying to listen to the music
just a fat body to cover the holes
I'm so happy you're playing this! jermaHeart
They said "you can't be an asshole anymore"
It's a little late for some people.
What's your favorite burger you like? Mine's Fritos.

I'm so glad you're playing this game :)
what is the best fast food place in vegas
I'm about to go to bed, thanks for the stream <3
I'm so glad he didn't have to watch the VOD
I think you need to change the game
Theres a whole video of the creation of this game
you can make a box with your own hair
JERMA IT'S YOUR FAULT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME
jermaSun JERMA YOU DON'T HAVE TO STREAM FOR US
i think this is the worst thing youve done so far
i wish jerma would give me a sub so i can post a picture of his feet on my twitter :)
I'm so happy that I'm here for the stream
You should just play the game normally.
its not like we're all gonna get slimed
can you please play the other game i'm not a sub :(
he's just trying to show us that he's a god gamer
you dont have to do anything just play the game
you can sell your own body parts to make money
I think you can just jump off the balcony if you want to
You can still get the 5 dollar house
I thought it was going to be about the shoe
You're not a very good farmer jerma
I'm so glad he didn't play this game
jermaChomp C L E N T I N
do you have any idea what you're doing?
what if we all just share a bed
theres a lot of different settings for the menu
If you don't make it to the end of the game I'm gonna fucking
====================
you can make it a million times easier
why are you trying to make a terrible joke
I have a friend that plays this game and he can play this game for hours and he's really into it
What is the point of this game if you can't do it
You didn't say it was a joke, it's your right
you were supposed to tell us about it
just go to the gym and do some curls
I just got here, why is Jerma in a bathtub
Jerma you're like the only person on twitch to have a real job
you need to make it an emote to hide it
What is the story behind the old lady?
I have been here for 20 minutes and I still can't believe he's playing the worst game ever made.
the game is just making you do the same thing every time
I have a friend who plays this game. He's really good at it.
Just make it look like you're a serial killer
It's called a "switch" if you know what I mean
theres a way to get to the secret area
he's playing the game with a controller jermaVenus
You can just click on the box
hey can you explain what you're playing today?
I feel like you shouldnt be streaming, that is why I was bored
i wonder if this is the same game as that one where the dev had to tell him he was too dumb to understand
Theres a blue light on the roof
I just came back and the music is so good
would you rather have a rat eat my ass
jerma is gonna have a stroke on stream
i think we can all agree that crack is the best drug
You were right about the game not being good
you can use the cheat code "FAR1"
just take the meds and relax, you'll be fine :)
can we get some jerma in chat for the stream
It's weird how Iâ€™m just here for a stream.
jermaWalk STREAM NOW jermaWalk GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE jermaWalk
you're in a coma, you need to wake up
is this the same game as the last one?
You can make it a million times easier, just do the same thing over and over
just wait for the guy to die
what if you just have a vacuum and the stream is already muted
Jerma is gonna be live in 30 minutes
you have to click on the rock to get to it
you have to have a gf to play
theres a secret level if you beat this first try
The game is for people who are just bored, you can't beat it
theres a secret room in the middle
i hope this is the last stream ever
oh boy, the new fortnite game is out jermaVenus
you should play the celeste music instead of this
you have to go up to the top of the hill to get to the secret area
if you want to see a speedrun try this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3pFFPSlRQy4
this game is so fun to watch
is this the streamer that beat Jevil first try?
you can't win this game without a level 5 in the game
oh my god youre gonna have to put the ladders down
this is what happens when you use your brain
you can get to the end of the game
Please do another voice clip I can't hear it
you should make an emote called "jerma" and put it on your main channel
you can make it an emote if you give us your credit card number
you just look like a short, fat, sweaty, boomer
you can make it a million times easier
why are you using the same character all the time
Would you ever consider playing Monster Hunter World again?
I'm the guy that was trying to warn you about the virus, so I'll probably be in chat later

it's like the home depot theme song
go to the shop and buy the wood

THEY ARE ACTUALLY FUCKING TURNING YOU INTO A CROWD

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 you got any jups in this jup? jermaJup3 jermaJup4

you're making the game harder than it has to be
I'll show you the secret to making Jerma happy
this is so much better than the first game LUL
It's okay to let your old man body die
i just realized he has no shoes on
I'm going to tell my wife about that
you can find them in the tavern
you can get a soul heart if you kill one of the bosses
Hey Jerma, I'm having a rough day but thanks for being so awesome, I'm glad to see you're doing a great job at your job.
i wish i was a pyscho like you
you're just gonna get so mad at the ending that it's gonna be a 12 hour stream
you should play the game again sometime, it's pretty good
jerma you have to be a pro to beat this level
I'm not sure if he knows what a rat is
jermaIQ I'm just a big brain with the big brain
I think he's doing the things that he does on purpose
You need to see the ending on youtube
This is the best game ever made by a human
it's a joke, you're just making it up
do you have your own character or is this the one you're playing as
is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
you're a very good streamer and we appreciate it <3
can you please get the boots for your dog
Jerma what the fuck is wrong with you
it's the same with the other ones
you can just pick up items from the marketplace
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES
I wouldnt even think of that, this is just a bad idea
LUL jerma doesn't know how to count LUL
just look at the left side of the map
you can turn off the fog of war
that's why you never eat a fruit
will you be playing the new dlc?
you need to go to the bathroom
if you don't get a soul heart you're a fucking psycho
but if you get it first try, I'm sure you'll do it on stream
you have to hold R to use it
you can have a blue heart on the main menu
It's a good thing I'm here for you
this game is great, you should play it
Jerma you've been streaming this whole time and you're still not done
do you want to know what the best burger in the world is?
just use your voice to find out
you can buy the axe from the shop
i think it's a good thing you're not playing it anymore
you can't just do a random button press in the menu. It's like buying a new car with a bunch of extra parts
You can use the boots to get the boots
why do you think we're in this game
you can get a soul heart if you kill one of the bosses first try
This is a really good game, I think it's on Steam
I'm here for the stream and not the game
you can go into the workshop and craft a new bow
You are currently on the tutorial menu of this game
get the demon souls and summon the demon
that's why you never get a soul heart
you can actually hear the anger in his
====================
R
I'm going to go do the dishes, thanks for the stream jermaHeart
this is the best game ever made. but it has a lot of kinks
you have to get a better game first
I really like this game and it's been getting a lot of love
you're gonna have to do a bunch of stuff to make sure you don't get an infection
I'm not going to lie, this is a fun stream

You can buy more stuff from your troops
Jerma is the type of guy to get the boots
you just have to fight the boss in the middle
i'm watching this stream in my car and its all i hear
I'm going to be honest, I'm not even kidding

I'm so happy I can watch you play this game, this game is so fun
i saw a guy on reddit say they were gonna do a 24 hour carnival stream

you can get some of the other stuff
I'm a bit of
====================
I would play the new binding of issac every day for the rest of my life
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I think Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -8. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
what if he actually died to pinwheel LUL
I am pretty sure he's been dead for a while
you can go to the shop on the first floor
he's not gonna be able to complete it
is this the streamer that beat the final boss of league on stream
do you have a special guest appearance or is this a joke
i love how you were just a stuntman for the whole movie
you just need to use a gun to kill them all
why would you use a gun when there is a mini gun in the room?
i can't believe jerma killed that lady on stream
just beat it, its not worth it
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Monday. Around 3-4pm PDT!
you know what else makes me happy? watching the stream :)
I have to go to work soon, have fun
but what if theres a dev in chat
what about the game that had your face?
you said you had to play the music for it
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 I don't have the power to do this jup
the only thing i would do is not watch jerma
you know, you're a meme character right?
Dude, this is the hardest Iâ€™ve laughed in a while
you can see the bottom of the bottom left
you can't just run around the corner
hey jerma can you repeat the joke
How many of us are here for the carnival stream?
You can get another one for $40
Hes gonna get a heart attack from this
i got a phone call from jerma, he has a heart attack
What do you think of the new Mario game?
please look at the top of the head
Is this the streamer that got stuck in the sewer?
is this the guy that lost to the lava spider
they are going to do the same thing again
you need to beat the final boss to unlock the secret
you cant just call him a boomer and not play it
How is this guy so fast? Iâ€™ve never seen him that fast
they're not trying to get you to play this
i mean you can make anything, but what if you want to play a game with it?
If you don't do the joke about Jerma, you're a weeb
what kind of game do you play?
Do you know how to unlock the secret boss?
You have to look at the top of your head to see the sky
you can literally play as the alien
this game is a full on trainwreck
you can actually do it jerma, just be careful
You can't just start a riot and start playing
theres a shortcut that leads to the sewer
this is the best game i've ever seen
why do you keep putting the worst parts
you can't even get the ending without getting the ending
I would rather watch a fucking vod over this
I'm gonna be honest, this is probably the worst stream I've ever done
why do you put your facecam on the side of the camera
it's not a joke, it's a fact
I love how Jerma is using his psuedo-mental abilities to get to the top of the mountain
JERMA YOURE GOING TO DIE IN THE BATHROOM
this is the most fucked up game ive ever seen
jerma you're not very good at this game
I want to be an alien but I don't want to live in a society where people can tell me how to live
You can't be late, it's just a delay
I love how Jerma is using his psuedo-mental powers to get to the top of the mountain.
You're not going to beat this game, you're gonna die
theres a shortcut that leads to the sewer
I'm so glad I joined just in time for the full-on Jupstorm
this game is just a fever dream made by a bunch of idiots
that guy is a total psycho right now
@
====================
Champ
You're not a fan of the same game twice
I'm too lazy to get the game over
it's okay you have to talk to the guard
I wish I could be a mod for this chat
what's the point of the carnival if you can't get the money?
You need to play the music to this game
Have you ever had a weird dream?
there is a reason we use the word "pepe"
You can just buy it and use it
The dog is about to die, use the poop
You need to keep it in there
you just have to keep it in there
Jerma is a furry and I'm fucking crying
I'm gonna go watch the vod now, thanks chat
SOMEONE EAT THE FISH. GET THEM FROM THE FISHING ROOM
this is just the dark souls of kung fu
did you see the reddit thread about it
I bet you have a lot of money
you need to play more of this game
Are you going to play the sequel to Sekiro?
I bet you can't even beat a boss in this game
you're not gonna beat this game? just beat it
theres a fan in the wall behind the car
It's gonna be like 10+ hours of your last stream
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
I like how you never tell us about your colonoscopy
I have a laptop in my room, what do I do?
you can hold shift to pause the game
jerma you're not a real gamer if you can't play with your friends
I bet you put a dollar in your mom's credit card
this is like the ending to kirby's island ride
if you read this, you are now cursed for the next four hours
you could play The Thing or The Thing 2
Is this the streamer that never uses a controller?
I think you need to use the special arrows
it's like the clip of the small boy saying "i'm so small"
i mean, this is the same game as the last, but it's not super bad
the problem with this game is that the game is a lot more boring than its sequel
It's a shame that you're playing this game, but you have to play the DLC
You need to find the secret room in the base
You're a celebrity, you need to do everything you can to make it happen
he's gonna do a few streams in the background
this game has the same music as the first game
I have to go to bed, do you want anything?
This game is a lot of fun, chat :)
You are going to go crazy from this
can you get a refund on this?
they dont want to hear that shit LUL
I don't think the audio is what it looks like
It's only a few feet away, theres not much that can be done in it
do the original version of the game
i know its not an old person game
Can you get me some chicken nuggets please
You have to get the coin from the start
i need to be in the bathroom
I'm just going to say you're the best keep up the good work and to be honest I like your first channel a lot
I hope you've found the true ending
I can't believe you got the FOV
I mean, they're gonna be fighting on the floor
why would you want to play the game
just have the music be the sound of your dying voice
jerma is the only good gamer i know
what are you talking about, this isnt a game
i love how he is in a panic and just says "you look so weird today"
if you get the coin you can use it to buy a new boat
i'm just going to say it, its not hard
i mean, there is a way to get it
you're gonna die in a few hours, you need to restart
Have you ever played the Ed Edd n Eddy games?
it's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
you can just open the game, it'll show you what to do
You need to buy more stuff from
====================
you should play the game "Dogs and Cats" it's like this
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 6 YEARS
we don't know what you're talking about
you have to do it in the right order
THE GAME DOESNT MATTER, THE CAMERA DOES
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET US TO TALK ABOUT HIM
This is a good stream to watch :)
you know the game's called risk of rain?
What's your favorite type of fruit? pineapple, pineapple, pineapple juice?
you have to be a professional entertainer
i had a dream where jerma was just talking to himself
You can do the "fill in the blank" challenge on the first map
I think Jerma's gonna come up with a new character in like a week
you know what im going to do?
you know the game's not good when its too hard for you to play
i have no idea what you're talking about
what if you just had a different name
you should play the game with the PS4 controller
you were just playing a game about dreams
can you just do a standup comedy routine
its not the boss it's the normal boss
I'm a doctor, so I'm pretty sure you have a fever :)
You should go back to the game, I bet you didn't even get the boots
Jerma is a fucking HAGLY streamer, we know it
That's what happens when you try to talk
do you know what a turkey is
i was gonna make an emote of you saying that
Jerma would be better off with a bigger pc
You gotta wait for the next game
if you do the facecam I will donate $1000
theres a seagull rescue channel on the discord
you can get better weapons from chests
This is the worst joke I've ever heard
you have to get the boots first
i've got a hat for you! :)
you can change the date to any day or night
The whole game is an advertisement for a new game
I got a new outfit today, it looks pretty good
put on the new kanye west song
how does he know what a xbox is?
you can use the boots to jump
imagine if jerma was an actor and he was in this game
How do you think a squirrel is supposed to eat
you're gonna need a lot of money
I think you can climb up there if you take the Dragon
if you're good at something never do it for free
you're a terrible person, you'll never be a good at something
They don't let you have fun with the kids
I'm going to be so pissed if you play this
I think you can just make a random table
Jerma is going to be the new Nancy Drew
Jerma doesn't even have a schedule anymore :(
You know the game has a full moon, right?
I'm glad that Jerma's not playing Heroes of Might and Magic tonight, I'm glad he's not playing it tomorrow
you should play a game with a keyboard
i heard jerma has a boyfriend, but not his name
would you play the sequel to this game if it werent for the terrible ending?
I heard there is a guy named Jerma985
Jerma you don't have to restart the game everytime
Do you have the code for the new iPad?
you can get better weapons from chests
this is the most boomer thing ive ever seen
It's not a joke, it's a fact
If you die in the game you die in real life
you're making me want to throw up
im sorry jerma i dont think youre smarter than a 5 year old
YOU HAVE TO DO THE VOICE EVERY TIME
are you gonna play the new years eve stream?
I was wondering why the music is so fucking good
You can use the boots to jump down
Hey Jerma, I've been watching your stuff for

jermaChomp THAT'S ME. I'M THE RAT jermaRat jermaRat
do you really not know how to play this game?
you can't just pick up the ring
do you know what a banal is?
You can't just call them rats if they aren't rats
he is going to end up in the bathroom
I love this game so much, I'm so excited for it.
I'm gonna send you a picture of my dick with a marker
that's why you were on the cover
I'm glad to see that jerma is proud of his ottos toes
jermaWalk DONT LET THE VIRGIN CROWSHIP REVEAL jermaWalk
I just got here, what's going on?
when are you going to play the new star wars game?
you gotta put the controller in the microwave
you can do it you can do it
it's an easter egg, just get it from the main menu
how is this stream not on the menu yet
jermaOld the other ones are the same as me
you're getting a little too old for this game
hey buddy you need to start the stream
This is what happens when you do not stream
The voice acting is so good, it's amazing
you can't say that, it's a lie Kappa
its a reference to the game "The Movies"
you can play the other games on the same day
JERMA LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY I'M MINE
I love that the kid is in the corner
I wish he would stop playing so much
if you could be any of us, what would you choose
"you have a lot of stuff to play"
YOU CAN DO IT I BELIEVE IN YOU
that's the most frustrating thing about this game
I think the game was patched for the 360
I'm gonna go watch the vod, see y'all in a couple hours when it's over

Is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
JERMA MY FAMILY IS TRYING TO SLEEP, PLEASE DON'T STOP IT
You should buy a water filter for your bathroom
Just get an actual copy of this game
this is going to be a good stream
if you want a spoiler for the game go watch it
you're gonna need to get more teeth
how is that a mnemonic for a 7th grade word
this is what happens when you dont play with Jerma jermaPluto
why do you keep doing the same joke over and over again
The fact that you are just sitting here, watching chat, makes it feel like this is your life
Please play Doki Doki Literature Club, it's a good game
you have to tell him it's not your fault
don't play this game on the PS4
go to the bed and sleep, its a game
I'm not sure, did you see the new "Trial and error" trailer?
jerma you are not playing the right way you are playing the wrong way

I think he's playing the wrong game but the audio sounds good
theres a guy in the audience, he wants to see if youre real

you should've put on a suit and tie
it's not a video game it's a game
I think that was the last time he played it

I can't believe you can't even beat a real game
Jerma you can't lose to pinwheel, you're a fuckin boomer
The people who bought the DLC got like $10k
the music for this game is so good
I have to be honest I'm not even trying to be nice to this guy
I hope Jerma doesn't get banned for this game

Iâ€™m sorry but you have to play the Contra Hard Corps OST
I had a dream where Jerma was my father and he wanted to be my teacher
put a fence around the gravel to make it look like it's covered in bugs
the reason you're still in this game is because you're so short
I'd like to see you play the music

You have to put your face on the cow
Is this the streamer that played a game for 8 hours?
I want to see the end of this game

hey can you go to the tavern with me :)
Oh my god he's gonna fall for this one
you can get free dlc from the menu
you can use the arrow keys to move around in the game to progress
It's because the game is not good enough to stream on.

why does he keep using the xbox controller
he literally just said he was doing a backflip
jerma you can't just let me out of my cage
I'm not even sure about that, but I think I might have to try it out
I'LL SHIT MY PANTS IF YOU DON'T
why is it so loud when he's streaming
You can use the axe to do the big axe move
its a real shame that chat is so toxic and abusive
You can buy a bunch of things for your head for some reason
you have to have the house as an example
jermaOld let me get my grandson to eat his lunch
you need to get the boots for the house to function
jermaWalk WHATS THE POINT OF THE STREAM IF IT'S A JOB jermaWalk
I'm going to bed, goodnight everyone jermaHeart
Just keep playing, you'll get used to it soon
I love the one that's like a 3rd grade math test
it was the one with the guns LUL
i have never had that before i think it's because i have no idea what's going on
I'm in the bathroom, can you pause the game?
jermaWalk COWARD STREAMER TRACKS CRYSTAL WITH GUNS jermaWalk
Hey , I've been watching for a while and you're still playing this?
I am a lawyer and I know what you mean
you need to look at the house jerma
this game is like a fever dream, jerma's gonna die
jermaPluto Jerma is going to end up in a room with a picture of his face on it
can we have a vr chat stream? I think it would be great
I can't believe jerma would do this to me
I'm glad you're enjoying the game :)
Jerma I think you're a really good character and you're the best one
jermaOneguy is gonna be the next emote LUL
You can do a full playthrough with a mod that replaces the old one
what if the goal is to get money
that's the exact same thing as the 100%
you can only walk when you have a leg
I don't want to see you play this
you can still be in the next area
you can play the music over it
hey jerma have you ever played the monster hunter series?
i'm just imagining the map and it's just this
jermaOld I can't believe you've been such a coward
how much is the highest tier? LUL
you're gonna get fucked in the head by that
will you be streaming on the 21st?
I can't believe Jerma is going to be late
you're supposed to move the camera down and not the other way around
you can do that with the shovel too
Jerma is going to play Jump King on the 23rd
Why is the audio so good for this game
what is the point of this game if it's just going to be a tutorial
remember to check in your house every night
you dont even have the boots jerma
you gotta keep that thing on the table
Can we get a stream where you just sit and chat for an hour?
i'm back, what did i miss :)
Why are you so bad at this game
this is so fucking funny, why do you even have a meltdown?
it's actually a joke it's your facecam
jermaWalk GET THIS GAME OUT OF MY VIEW WHAT I WANT IS NANCY DREW jermaWalk
please do a 24 hour stream where you just sit and chat for an hour
he just wants to be your friend jermaPluto
it's a really good game but a lot of it is pretty boring
It's a little late to be honest
I got my mom to call me Kappa
you should try to get the boots
you can get a lot of cool items
This is the streamer that lost to Pinwheel
i'm trying to find out what's going on

You can't have a baby, you have to have a cow.
JERMA WAKE UP YOU'RE IN A COMA, YOU'RE IN A COMA
Jerma you have to stop your momentum by going into the wall
i want to see jerma play mordhau again

I want to go to bed, goodnight everyone
You need to do it to save the world

how can you not have a mouse
you can use the new mouse that came out today

you need to take care of yourself
im not a sub but im here to support you

I'm sure he's done the first part of the game
I've had that happen, it's just that it happens to me
This is what happens when you don't stop streaming :)
he just wants to say how cute he is
YOU COULD HAVE JUST BUILT A PLASTIC

Hey chat, I'm going to the store to buy some chocolate
Your audio is messed up, please fix it
I'm glad you're finally playing a game that makes sense.
I think you need to get the boots
is this the streamer that got stuck on the last level of sekiro?

I'm gonna be honest, this game is fucking amazing
You can't just keep playing the same level for hours
If you want to get the boots you have to beat it first

you are going to be able to do the whole game in this
the new version of this game is even worse
you can see jerma's asshole on the side of his head
I can't believe you're still playing this game
I'm going to go to bed, see you in the vod when the stream starts
What about the time you lost to Pinwheel?
I'm gonna go watch the vod, thanks for the entertainment.

you know you're a millionaire when you think about it
You're going to die in the game
Jerma is actually a Jerma985 fan
====================
I wish there was a way to turn the chat into a tier list of the top tier chat members
my wife and i are watching this on the toilet
i feel like jerma would be a great streamer
jermaOld I have my PC on my computer now jermaOld
i'm in the shower, what the fuck is happening
i can't believe jerma is a fucking psycho
but you can also go to the church and worship with your family
You can use the bar to hover over the guy
you have to go left and then right
I think theres gonna be a couple of mods
I just tuned in and I'm so confused
why are you wearing a backpack on?
you could have beat it in one try
this is the most intense thing ive ever seen
jerma is doing a 100 000 chance
just like how you tried to do in the game, it's easy
You can use your channel points to buy a dildo
how long is the stream gonna be for?
do you have any plans for the carnival stream?
i remember when jerma said that he would kill everyone on stream
You're just gonna keep playing this game anyway
Make a video of it and then post it in the discord
that was the least of my worries today
I think that's a lot to ask for
what if they take a picture of your butt
jerma is playing a game for the first time today
Just take the time you need to get to the top
please play the game that came out today
the dev is dead. it's all you have to do
you have to kill him to get the boots
its a dream come true but its so good
you can tell they are just being weird and weird
Oh my god that was a fucking SHORT stream
It's not a great idea for a stream
I'm glad you are playing this game
you can use the bars to click on stuff
you can play it like a more chill game
I'm trying to get you to play monster Hunter.
are you gonna play the new smash DLC?
it's just a good thing that you didn't stream the first game
why did you say that like you were going to a mental ward?
I'm glad to see that all the other people are here
can you do the "I'm so happy" voice
you can hear the pain in his voice
did you just say that you're a bad influence on us
he was a pro at the tennis game
Jerma you got the right idea, you have to play it
you can save the game on the pc
this is a lot of work for just 1 character
I'm gonna be honest, I'm really excited for this stream.
i thought that was a rick and morty reference
my brother had a case of the pimple in his chest and he was actually allergic to it
I'm gonna be honest, I'm really excited for this stream.
I'm not even sure what's happening in this game, I'm just here for the chat
why are you wearing a backpack on?
i need to go to bed, can you pause the stream?
You said "I don't know how to play this" the other day
if you don't play the first game you're a fucking moron
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ MOM I'M TALKING TO YOU, DON'T START THE STREAM OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE

i dont think jerma will ever play this again
do you have a favorite sandwich you
====================
How many more times will you have to tell me you're in a coma
jerma i want to see you play this game
it's a 7/10, all the other 9/10s are 10/10
is it true that you played this game for 5 hours
I mean, I'd love to watch it again.
I don't know what the actual fuck is happening
I'm here to watch the vod and not tell anyone, this is the best stream
i like how jerma is not looking at chat right now
You can change the game to the "other" music
Oh my god he's still in the beginning LUL
imagine not knowing how to make a pizza
you could have just done that already jerma
i wouldnt say that but i would say that
i hope jerma's face cam is on today
I can't wait to see him play the rest of the game jermaVenus
The mods are in chat, you can't stop them.
I'm in the middle of the desert and I'm scared
Jerma you're playing this in front of a live audience. You're the most handsome streamer on twitch.
there is a mode to get rid of the blocks
just be yourself, you'll be fine :)
you can change the music in the settings
you can change the difficulty in the options
why did you buy the hulk costume?
dont forget the sword, you got it from the witch doctor
what if the monkey is the thief but he doesnt care
you can get the code from the museum
jerma you don't have to do it, you can just keep doing it

"I need to get out of here"
is he doing the secret ending for this game?
what if you just threw it in the trash
its not a lie, you're just pretending to not know
you don't have to do it in front of an audience
you can look up how to beat this level
you're gonna end up in the bottom
I hope you play The Witcher 3, it's pretty good
jermaOld Back in my day we played the oldschool way
Just imagine how many people you'll get killed in this fight
i wanna see the end of this game
he's going to come back and play the game
if you don't finish this one, you can't finish this one
would you rather have a nuke or a nuclear bomb
You don't need to do this, you just have to do it
I love how the game is just a shitty game
you can't talk about anything but that guy
How does Jerma not have a toilet seat?

I feel like I've heard a lot of these noises
will you ever return to the game?
you dont have to walk around, just keep running
Jerma, you just watched an ad for a game called Crazy Taxi
i'm already a millionaire. i can afford a house
you can use the boots to go to the bottom of the lake
YOU WENT TO THE OLD HOUSE ON THE SAND
you can use it to go to the bottom of the lake
This game is actually pretty cool, and not a bad game
jermaWalk i want to get off Mr. Jerma's wild ride
"why is there a gun on the table"
You can have more than one army, you can only have 1
You can get a lot of money for this
i'm playing this game with my friend and it's really fun
I think they're making a new game with the new music.
you have to go through the map
i think you have to get a new character
is that the same as the music from last night
you have to play the game again
this is a lot of work for a game that just came out
I'm really glad you're enjoying this game, I didn't know you were playing it.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE
====================
. You're going to get kicked out of the game
you should play the entirety of the new smash bros on stream
they are just trying to get to the point
this is the most repetitive thing i have ever seen you do
This game is so much fun with the mods in it
you can make any character just by walking through the game
you need to be at least 6 feet tall to ride this ride
I'm going to get so mad at you if you don't stream this
i dont think he did anything but say it
you're a very good actor, the ones you make are very good
This game is so good, Iâ€™m glad to be here
If you wanna learn how to play this game, read the book
I think I like that you're wearing a clown suit
you can hold down to pick up the gun
you're the one that gets mad at us
i just realized that there is a silent hill on the map
if you do a level select you can pick a character
this game is fun as hell so watch it
i can't believe jerma is finally playing a game
Are you going to play the rest of the game?
you are the best streamer on twitch
That was like the ending to the movie
it's not just you, it's your face! jermaVenus
you can switch to a buster in the menu
you're not even in the game, you're just here
it's gonna take you two hours to figure this out
it's a great game, but it's boring at best
Make sure you do the same joke with the boots
Would you ever consider playing the dark souls 3 dlc?
you can just wait for the elevator
what are you even talking about :)
theres a pizza oven in the room
You can just press Z to use the shield
just eat it and its not even that hard
you are so much better at this than i am
I wish I could see Jerma right now
Can you get the sound of a dog barking
why is he wearing a backpack, that's his entire life
We just heard you say you were gonna play the game
you're going to get kicked out of the game
this is how jerma views us chat members
I don't think you have the memory
what is this game, is it good? LUL
Do you still have the money to play this?
i mean it's always fun to just go
this is gonna be like a 2 hour game
its been 15 years since youve streamed this game
Can you say I'm a disappointment please?
HE THINKS HE CAN'T BEAT THE BOSS LUL
you just made it into a joke
there is a bug where if you enter too many buttons the game will tell you which buttons to press
you should get more emotes like that one
Just joined the stream, is he still trying to figure this out?
I cant believe Jerma can play this game for 8 hours straight
you are playing this game as a literal child
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
it's not a bug, it's a virus. NotLikeThis
can you say "i'm so smart" for me?
please for the love of god turn it off
jerma's hair is falling off in the end
why are you playing this game? why would you want to fuck your child?
you can just press Z to use the shield
I would never want to play this game
The only thing you can do is not play it
you can just wait for the elevator to spawn
You're gonna get called a loser again
I just got here what is going on
you have to use the big guy to kill them
what if we all just had a week to live
you need to find the one guy
I'll pay you to do that voice again
Are you going to play Black & White 2?
You have to put it on the "watch" channel, you can watch any time
Do you have a link to the last stream?
@Jerma
====================
_LUL_T_Y_G_N_E_C_O_N_D_T_U_S
There is a way to get a lighthouses
can you put a bunch of eggs in the oven
jerma i am so proud of you :)
put it in the microwave for 30 seconds
I'm begging you to play the game again, it's the best one
You can also use it to make a sword out of a single bite of bread
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 I can do this jup easily jermaJup3 jermaJup4
Dude, you're making me feel bad for buying that.
its on the floor in front of you
Heâ€™ll be playing the game in his sleep
jerma have you seen the person who made this game?
"You're so good at this" - Jerma, on playing this game
why is there a rat in the bathroom
I'm not gonna lie I'm surprised you didn't know that
you have to find the rock first
I feel like you're supposed to be good at this game
Why do you want to be a therapist?
that's the point of the game, you're just trying to play it
i can't believe jerma's going to beat the game
how do you feel about that new bionicle skin?
just start playing the game, its fine
Make sure you check the car's license before you go to bed
I have to go to bed now, can you pause the stream for a bit?
You can use it to make a sword out of a single bite of bread
You have to hit him with the shovel
you have to put the plate in the pan
they don't even have a clue what they're doing
The only way to win is not to play
I like how chat is moving so fast it hurts
you said you'd play half life alyx
You can put your mouse over the mouse
you need to make a new character that wont be as good as you
use the worm to take your wife
can you get a hug from me please
It's okay if you don't want to watch the rest of the game.
I'm so glad you're playing this game.
This is the same game as before
I'm going to make a new character. I'm going to make a new character
I can't believe you got banned for saying that
Do you know when the next Sam and Max stream is?
There is a way to get a lighthouses
i'll do it, just not on a daily basis
you can just give them a potion to heal them
You're going to have to buy all the stuff for it
I think this is the last time you'll ever see this guy
Why do you have a halberd in your room
he's playing jump king again, why
Why is Jerma playing a game where he gets to make weird noises?
YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE BOTTOM LEFT ON THE RIGHT SIDE
JERMA THE STREAM IS NOW IN POG
remember when you told us you were a "gamer" in chat?
I am still waiting for the new jerma985 video
what if theres a mario maker 2 level?
i'm getting real tired of this stream LUL
How does it feel to be a Jerma985 streamer?
dont worry this game is not for you
if you don't get it you're a filthy liar
you have to kill the cow first
YOU DONT HAVE A FLAMING SCREEN LIKE A REAL GAMER
i've never heard a Jerma stream that lasted more than 5 minutes
Jerma just play whatever you want to play
there's a little bit of a visual glitch, but that's it
jerma is gonna be a gamer after this
please go back to the game, this is the worst part of the game
you are going to get screwed over
Did you hear about the new album cover?
You could always go back to the tutorial
Jerma do you know what a vroomer is

====================
You'd think he'd be good at it, but he's never played it
can i get a 10 second rundown of the stream
I've never seen a game so fun in my life
you can do it, it's just hard :)
just make a full game of Fortnite
"I'm gonna leave" - Jerma985, 2020, after beating Fortnite 3 times
you can hear him in the back of his mind
There's a door to the right of the door
Jerma you've been in a coma for the last hour
i think you can unlock a new class by going to the town
I hope theres a Jerma RUMBLE in the next 24 hours
You can beat the game, just keep jumping
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
Please play the Contra Hard Corps OST

jermaOld how do I play this game? jermaOld
This is what happens when you don't go to the right
I'm back, what did you do to the otto emote?
it's like the only way to go
I feel like a real gamer right now
jermaOld Back in my day we only had 4 jermaOld
dont forget you can make the camera shake to look at the person with the gun
Jerma your voice is not as good as it used to be
that's what happens when you don't take the time to make a joke
I just got here, what's going on?
jerma please you have to stop playing this
If you want to get mad, play KENSHI
This is gonna be a long one chat
you know what they say about a man with a penis
you should really get that man a new mouse
have you considered a dildo-fighting game? that would be so rad.
the world record for this game is like 3 hours
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 6 YEARS
what about the last time you did that
dont forget the last time you took a picture of a girl
why do you need to be so close to the camera
I'm not even kidding, this is the most amazing thing I've ever seen
This is your first time playing this game. You're in a coma.
go to the inn and buy a potion, then go back to the tavern
You can take a screenshot of the screen and put it in the right place
what if we all got rats in our dreams
I can't wait for the stream to start :)
Have you seen the porn of Jerma?
I'm getting sick of this streamer. I'm going to die.
JERMA YOU'RE A FUCKING RACIST YOU SHOULDNT BE STREAMING
I'm going to do the same thing tomorrow
I can't believe you didn't say anything about the death of Nancy Drew PepeHands
You know what they say about a man with a penis

Theres a cheat code for the "Keep Talking" sound
Jerma you're not even playing, you're just being a dick
you have to use your own energy to heal @Jerma985
you're gonna need a lot of hair removal
He's a streamer he's not even a streamer
you can do it, just be aware of the AI
it's like you've been playing a video game for a few hours
I want him to play my favorite game
I will give you all my money jerma
why are you playing this game and not Dead Rising 2
Can you make your own drum set?
THE GREEN SCREEN SOUND LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A BATHROOM BREAKDOWN
you should probably get the boots, they are really good
I know you are having fun, but this is actually a really long mission.
I don't know what that is but I'm glad you're having fun
you could have just bought a new mic
if you play as the wii mote you can unlock the super mario
jerma are you going to play a real game
you are not a true gamer now
Just joined, has Jerma been on the first floor for the last hour?
you can hit the center of it
I thought you were a good gamer
I've been waiting for you to get to the next level
We can't afford a new memory card, please just switch it to an older one
You can use the free download of the game

I think you need to do a better Joke
YOU CAN HOLD THE HAND TO MAKE A TRIPLE
i want you to do the pepe voice
You can use the free download of the game to make a secret path
I like the game and I hope he plays it again
it's a good thing we can't hear the sound of your voice
I'm not even sure if that's the joke
they have a bunch of new weapons and stuff you can equip
You're gonna have to buy new gloves for the next game

this is the worst game ive ever seen
JERMA YOU SAID YOU WOULD PLAY IT FOR 10 HOURS
is this the guy who couldn't beat the first game on stream?
you can use the free download of the game to make a secret path for you
i can't believe jerma is fucking dead :(
I thought the same thing was true with my family
theres a secret path for you in the game
why did you play that shitty game
The only way to win is not to play it
you are doing a great job! A GREAT JOOB
I am a fucking PLEB, I am the PLEB
you can't be a boomer and have a baby
it's just a clip of a clip LUL
can you do a fortnite dance?
I'm gonna be honest, I don't know what this is
you need to sell the house, you'll get it
it's ok, jerma, you can let the game play itself
This is the worst level I've ever seen
jerma is just a bad streamer, he's bad at games
i can't believe this is jerma's last stream
just play the whole game at once
you can place torches to make torches in your town
You have to keep it in the same spot
You can always use the free download of the game to make a secret path for you
just admit that you have a bad taste
you can buy the switch for the money
You're the only one who needs a picture of his feet
I know you're here, but can we get some?
you can get
====================
I hope you're not too old to get a job
i want to go to bed but i have to sleep
its time to start counting your points Kappa
the big rat that makes all the rules
I hope he plays Jump King again
jermaPluto Jerma is the only person in the world who can see this
you can use the grapple to land on the target
i mean, i guess they can just stay and not go crazy
I can't believe that Jerma has a massive stash of BTTV emotes
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, see you all next stream
i can't believe jerma is a wizard and doesn't know how to use the bow
HE IS SO CLOSE TO A REAL DEAL
play "I'm a professional gamer" by kanye west
you are going to be so disappointed when you see that
I've been watching Jerma since 2012 and I still have the same amount of time on my hands
your inventory is full and you're holding it
i just came here, what the fuck is happening
you can still get that jump kick
it's a bit much but it's not bad
this game is good for like 4 hours
If you get it on stream I'll donate 5 grand
jerma's stream is so good i love it
you can be the ghost of your past
THE CLOWN CAR IS THE CLOWN CAR
You need to make sure you're not walking into traps or traps will just kill you
it's like he's wearing a hat and he's wearing a backpack
what about the DREW CREW? @Jerma985
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
this is the most generic game i've ever seen
jerma the screen is very small and it's impossible to see your face
when will you play touhou i've never played it before
theres a manual that says you can do this in 5 mins
Jerma can you make it so we can all spam the chat button like in the video
how many hours has he been playing this game
you need to make the little girl into a luigi
this is like a really bad cooking mama
I'm a guy and I'm not a girl
what's the point of this game if you're just gonna go around murdering people?
can you move the camera so we can see your feet?
He's the guy who beat Pinwheel in one try
you can use the grapple to land on the target
i think the game is broken for anyone else
I'm gonna watch this stream live on youtube
jerma you need to get to the surface
get a cat and use it to feed your dog
is it true you are the top finisher of the simpsons?
you can use the grapple to land on the target
If you're really good at something never do it for free
I feel bad for anyone that's just now realizing that you're not a real gamer
Just like that time you ate your favorite shoe
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.
this is your mother speaking, you're playing this game too much
im in the middle of watching this stream, how is this game so good
jermaFireman jermaFireman jermaChomp jermaChomp jermaFireman jermaFireman jermaFireman

its a shitty old game with a shitty story
Jerma is so good at this game Kappa
I hope he doesn't play Ace Attorney tonight
"This is a big boy, the game is not good enough"
this is the last mission of this game
I just got here, what's going on?
They could have just said "no"
you need to do the gun fight with the other gun
You can use the grapple to land
====================

JERMA YOU CAN DO THE VOICE ACTING
HE'S THE SNAKE AND HE'S THE SNAKE
you can unlock new heroes by completing the quest

you'll never get the good ending, just get some dragons and get the ending you want
You can get an extra version of the game with the DLC
I've been watching you since the tf2 days, have you played any other TF2 games?
Jerma is the only one who likes to gamble
theres a song you can play for free on your phone
you can sell it for 5 dollars
jerma i'm telling my dad he's a sicko
how does he know what a jpeg is
you can save your money to get a better item
you should play the doom ost :)
That was the worst thing youve ever done
Jerma you can't just use the stream as a platform to tell us what you like
I don't think you can just kill everyone
you are not playing as an actual hero, you are playing as an NPC
jermaPluto he's been doing this for too long
jermaVenus IM GONNA BE A DREW CREW PLEEEAAAASS
why is this so good, why are you playing this game?
I'll have to see you all at the carnival, but I'd love to see you doing some Sonic Racing!

you can do it and you'll be fine
i hope you have a good day jerma
I bet you can't beat the first part of Fellowship
you can get a really good wii mote for 200$
jerma stop being mean to us and play the game jermaPluto
You don't have to jump every time, just press Y to do a jump
we need a full hour of ads for the carnival stream
it is the first time you've ever been on a stream
its gonna be a real shame if you dont
we can tell you what you want to do :)
i think they were saying you need to drink more milk

you should play the souls games on stream
you can also sell it for a lot of money
you can change the music to fit the mood
you have to save the game, there are no save files in this game
He's gonna get in trouble with the law
jerma, you are a good person and a good person
theres a giant rat in the room
did you see the new sam and max video
JERMA YOU CAN DO THE VOICE ACTING
what do you guys think of the new Jerma
Jerma is like a gnome but he's not a goner
How many times have you died to Pinwheel?
I thought this was a family friendly stream
what if you got the wrong door
i like how jerma is playing this game and not the real thing
You gotta drink more milk. It's good for your heart
theres a secret level after this level
you can find it in the main menu
you are going to have a hard time beating this game
HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS PISS IN THE CHAT
you can get a really good wii mote for 150$
I bet you don't even know the difference between a wii and a wii mote
i would probably like to see you play this

How did you know the names of the people in your town?
he has to be in the house now
you can use the magic
====================
 at the start of the stream
We know you're a terrible entertainer, you have no idea how much we love you
you can just walk out of the room and walk in
can you take a break and come back to this
it's not the same. we're playing the same game
jermaDisgust you're gonna make me fall asleep on the toilet
I'm going to get dinner and take a shower.
oh my god theres that one level in this game
theres a game called "Drew Crew" that has a ton of content, its free to play
you know you can just buy the whole thing from the store
I don't know, I think it was "Hey, it's me, just wanted to say I suck at games"
It's a little late to be honest
Just do what you do and wait
is it a thing or a bug
This is what happens when you dont do your taxes
this is a pretty good game for a gamecube gamecube
hey jerma if you had to ban one from existing, would you choose hamburgers or Otto? :)
your character looks like he's wearing a blazer
Jerma you have to make a game, not do it
you have to do the thing where you play a game for 30 minutes straight
I got a cat, it's named Ash
I cant wait for the next community content night :)
jerma hasnt been the same since he moved to vegas
we know you're a bad entertainer, we know you're a bad entertainer, you're gonna fall asleep
you said you were doing it today
You can do a second jump to get the boots
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A TF2 STREAM jermaVenus
jerma can't even be friends with his mom FeelsBadMan
i hope he just turns the camera on and says he's naked
You have to use the rocket launcher
Did you ever get the guy that streamed himself eating a burger?
it's a good game, but I just can't see it on stream
I'm surprised that you're playing this in a video game
how long have you been streaming the game?
you can use the rocket launcher to get down
can you show us your feet in the bottom right
I think it's the health inspector from the first one
why does jerma always make the funniest faces in chat
do you think the tarantula is a snitch?
you can use the rocket launcher to get down
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2498. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I think they're just trying to give you a headache
the first time you played this game you were running around with a chainsaw on your back
i thought this was a good game
jermaOtto ðŸšª jermaWalk POO POO PEE PEE ðŸšª jermaOtto ðŸšª
I think it's just a reference to the youtube video
you look like a homeless person
What if I don't get one of those LUL
You have to make a funny noise
he doesnt know about the hidden cave he was in
you're not going to win, you just missed the meatball challenge
you have to do the "play my level"

jermaDafoe I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
oh yeah this is the game where you can make up your own story
I mean he's still playing the game LUL
you can do that in the top left
you can do that in the top right
you could try to get a cloak
i had a dream where i was in the bathroom and the jerma was in the bathroom
what if the only thing that makes money is you jermaIQ
you can do that in the top left of the menu
can't wait for the next community content night

This is like that one episode of South Park
i can't believe you're still playing this game
@Jerma985
====================
One_Turtle_2 he's gonna be in the next one jermaVenus
jerma you're a giant rat that makes all of the rules
there is a button to increase speed
i thought you said you were playing b&w
Hey jerma can you please play the game that i really really want to see you play?
I can't believe he doesn't know what a microphone is LUL
He's gonna be like "whoa what the FUCK"
he's getting ready to come back from the doctor
but theres no reason to be sad about it
why do you keep trying to say yes
Dude the voice actor for Danny Devito is a fucking asshole
play the music i want to see what youre doing
he looks like a child on the left
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
you're not playing the game, you're playing a game
hey jerma can you please play the game i'm watching
JERMA I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE
I'm sorry, but you can't be this bad at this game, Jerma
I wish Jerma would read my bit message :(
jermaPluto I just want to grill for god's sake
you just need to make a room with the bars
I'll give you 100,000 bits if you say yes
i think you should play the game
you need to let go of the button to make the bird noise
jerma your hair looks really nice today :)
have you seen the new resident evil game?
I mean it's not like it's gonna be a long stream
you were supposed to be at the end of the stream
you can get a mod that makes the "pick up trash" map a tier
if you fall into the lava again, you get a free revive
so how many channel points for you to play the game
I don't think you can beat this game
you have to go back to the main menu
Jerma is just like a regular person :)
he's gonna do a 10 hour stream
it's not a big deal, its a scam
that's not what i meant it was not a big deal

you're making me want to play this game
it was a very fun game, thank you for playing it.

Jerma do you have a filter for this?
it's a good thing that you stopped streaming

would you rather have a 3 foot penis or a 2 foot penis
theres a bunch of people on the other side of the bridge
this is what the game was all about
I think I saw something, but I don't remember what

I wish we had a Jerma985 emote :)
you know what they say, you're in the right place
have you considered playing Path of Exile?
The only way to win is not to play
i miss the old jerma, the old jerma
can you please say something funny for me
you have to go up to the top right of the screen
what about the "S" in the bottom right?
go to the top of the tree
this is just like the last jerma rumble
how many times has he gotten to the tree yet?
do you know what a tarantula is?
he should play it because of that one song
I like how the voice actors are doing the voice
this is like a shitty ps2 game LUL
he can't see the sun when he's at night
you can just play a different game, you can play as yourself
Can you please play some more of this
im pretty sure you just woke up
It's an excuse to do a bunch of shitty cooking mama jokes
there are so many ppl here right now
can i get a f in the chat for my high school project
you're like a kid with a toothbrush
Make a new copy of this game
Have you seen the new Black & White 2 trailer?
you have to get the main menu to look at the main menu
if you play the game with a controller, you can use it on the gamepad
I have no idea what is going on
Theres a really good story for this
I'm looking at the same thing right now
you can just click the thing
this is a good game for a stream
you're about to die of old age
That's what you get for not streaming
this guy is just a tool to the game
There is a secret boss in this game
i cant believe they didnt make the fish into the lizard
get the stone sword and get the key
you have to be in the top right of the screen
theres a secret level in this game
it's okay jerma we understand, you're just scared
LUL it's not the same with the music
if you leave this game you'll get the boots
you're really good at this game, you're just really bad at it
it's the same thing as the one you played
I dont like this game because it is scary
This game is better than the original, I'm going to go watch it again.
do you have a bag of sugar?
HE'S GETTING H
====================
i like how jerma is playing a game about to be announced and chat is already talking about it
You need to be able to click the map to see the map
I can't believe this streamer doesn't know that the door is locked
what's your opinion on the game awards this year?
I hope you have a good time with your family
i dont want to go to the bathroom
I made a video with the same title :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_h1Wn0aJiA
just had to get a new one OMEGALUL
how long has he been doing this mission
I'm sure you'll find a way around it.
You can get a nice rest of your time there.
He's not going to play this game is he
do you know how much I'm gonna pay for you to play this?
oh yeah i think he said he was going to play this later
I don't know if it's the game or chat
He was just trying to get a snack
I love how Jerma985 is the only streamer that can do a 24 hour stream
Why do you sound like a parent
jerma have you ever heard of an off-shore oil company
I think you need to restart the game
he got so high he fell off the cliff
it was the giant rat that makes all of the rules
the game's so hard to read you're literally a toddler
did you see the movie The Mask?
is this the guy who got hit in the head on stream?
you have to click the map to see the map
i think he meant that in the game
I'm sure he'll be fine. I'm sure he'll be fine
the most you can do is to not make the joke.
so much to do so much to see
You need to go through the doors in the first floor
I bet that guy was the one that got you to do it
i have to pee can you pause the stream
I'm watching this stream on the toilet right now
can you please do a standup comedy routine for us?
you have to use the same thing as the other ones
I'm not sure if this is how the game works
JERMA IS THE ONLY STREAMER WHO CAN DO THIS
YOU NEED TO GET THE BOOTS TO BEAT THE GAME
please do the 24 hour stream joke
this game is a lot like warcraft 3
I don't think this game is as fun as it looks
Hes gonna get eaten by a bear
Is this the streamer that got PISSED ON ON STREAM?
You're gonna get banned for saying that
its not that bad, but its a little hard
You need to play the DLC before you play this
You can use the B button on your mouse to change the speed
I just want to see you play it, just for a moment
please let me just get a sip of water
this game is boring but it is so good
I'll make you a hot dog if you do it :)
you're too short to get in the car
YOU HAVE TO PAY THE COURT A FINE
this is going to be a mess LUL
you can't just say the word "ladies and gentlemen" in your head, you know that
You need to go through the doors
I remember when Jerma didn't have a back brace FeelsBadMan
what do you think of the new Animal Crossing
I'm not sure if that was a reference
Jerma's going to take his shoes off and go to the store
the little guys are the ones that can make you poop
I'm still waiting for the stream to start
this is gonna be a 10 hour stream
how are you gonna pay for the bills?
If you don't beat the game I'm unsubbing
play the game, you know you can do it
You gotta do the middle one first @Jerma985
how long do you think this game will take?
You have to get the other two
jermaOtto "You are the best streamer on Twitch"
jermaOtto "The man who can't even look at the sun"
This is going to be a lot of fun
you got the nuke on the
====================
so you have to use the key on the top left to find the key?
I love how you've been in a coma for years and you still don't know what happened
you can still sell them for 5 dollars but they are useless
You don't have to be a millionaire, just be a good streamer
this is the best one but yeah it's not the best one
have you ever played the sniper elite series?
i feel like you should start with the older one
it's just a big lie to make us think you're a bad actor
jermaSun JERMA WE LOVE YOU FOR BEING A MEMBER OF THE COWBOYS jermaSun
I cant believe he's going to play this for the whole stream
if you dont do this i will donate
i love how chat is just a bunch of weebs talking to themselves
you need to watch more green screen stuff
you gotta get the boots first then get the boots
is this the streamer that beat that shark on stream?
you can take the ring and kill him
I just got back, did you get your first ever job?
try to find the one with the heart
the good old days were spent in the bathroom
Jerma i have to go to bed now, please finish this
I really hope you play this again
You gotta get the boots first so you can dodge the tree
how do you get your hands on a keyboard
I was going to say it was a good idea
this is a lot of work to make this game
I'd pay for a wink if it was free
Hey Jerma, how much do you pay for a prostate exam?
its the one with the heart on it
It was a trainwreck, but a really good game
"I'm not gonna lie, I don't know what you're talking about"
is this the guy who couldn't beat jump king on stream?
i want to see you play my favorite game, minecraft
i want to play the game but im not sure if its worth it
You are literally the only person who can do it
why would you want to do this, you're gonna die in like 5 days
that guy was doing the hardest, you know
do you have any plans to play halo reach again?
i cant believe jerma is still in chat
I miss the old Jerma, the one who used to stream with Ster in the morning
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
theres a checkpoint you can do it
Jerma if you're reading this, please stop. I know streaming can be stressful, but putting your mental health above playing this game makes it so worth it.
jerma is a weirdo but i like him :)
I think it was because of the internet
I just got here, why is your character doing a spiderman run?
jerma have you ever tried to be a real gamer?
You need to find the secret entrance
do you have to put the camera on to record the game?
Jerma if you dont get a 100 word essay i will unsub
this game looks like it could be a good stream game
you can go to the top of the sky and find a mini boss
you should be able to do a 5 minute deep voice with the game, you'd make it funny
theres a secret cutscene in the game, you need to do it
you can use the rocket nozzle to climb the tower
you can just run to the side of it
You can get the boots by going to the side of the tree.
This game is like an indie game, and you're gonna have to buy it.
if you dont do it i will unsub
theres no way youre playing this for 10 years
you need to let the dog eat
i cant believe he's playing this game for the first time
Did you know that this is the best game ever made?
that's the most cursed thing I've ever heard
we need to make sure that you don't get eaten
this is what happens when you dont do the left
I'm just gonna make a big mess of this chat.
you need to get the boots first
You know you want to be a millionaire right?
I cant believe jerma is playing this game
@
====================
Jerma985
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
how long has he been live, is it still 1 hour?
I saw a jup on my phone yesterday
I like how you just wanted to read the entire book
did he really just go into a panic?
you can put the monster in a crafting table
you can get a really good one for $10
I'm gonna have a heart attack if you don't do it
i just got here and jerma is still playing this game
i'm pretty sure that's what they mean by "cheating"
it's not the same with any of the other levels
if you turn on the lights in the room, you can see the exact time
If you do it again, I will be sad
you can buy a set of boots
did you hear about the new 2ndjerma video?
jerma is gonna lose it he is too good
go to the tavern and come back to it
it was just like a dream, i could hear it
you're supposed to use the swing on the two enemies
you should buy a keyboard for this
you can make the village into a zoo
what if you were the one that made that video?
why do you look like a monkey?? LUL
you should try to get the secret ending
can you turn down the music, its really quiet
this is the part where he dies
I hope the next game is the Simpsons Hit and Run
why is the music so bad please
you should play that low budget spider game
I can't believe you took the controller out of your pocket
I made a mod that adds you to the discord
I'm a vod boy and I just want to say I'm proud of you
Jerma has never seen a dog in his life
just let it fall off the cliff
I hate this game so much. I can't believe this is how it ends.
Why is there a fucking box in your room?
Do you know how many tickets to win tickets?
you can go back to the other level
you have to look at the screen for the secret
you are so dumb, you can't even do this
you can upgrade it to a better weapon
you can do it in the next one, it's not hard
you have to wait until the end of the game
You can do it in the next one, it's not hard
go to the bar, theres a guy behind you
It's not a bad game, but it's a shitty one
YOU'RE LITERALLY THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
you have to make the town into a zoo
it is the same as the other level
i love how the game is just making this an e3 presentation
You can use it to play the Contra Hard Corps
Just got back. Can you explain the joke?
JERMA YOU JUST LEFT YOUR COMPUTER ON THE STAGE
do you know how many people are on this island right now?
You are the best! You are the best!
I'm so excited for this to be a firewatch stream
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
It's so weird seeing people just like this in chat
YOU CAN BUY A NEW ONE WITH THE DLC
you can use it to play the game
can you make it to the end of the game
you can use it to make the town into a zoo
this is the final mission of the game, it's not worth it
theres a way to save it but you have to kill every one
I'm just waiting for the next one to happen
you can get one for $10 on steam
dont forget to change your stream title
I like how he's trying to convince himself he's not actually playing this game
can you show us the cutscene for this?
"i want to go to the movie theater"
I cant wait for the next stream :)
@
====================

DUDE THE COUPLE STAGES IS OUT ON STEAM

You have to have a dog to play this game
i really hope jerma streams the simpsons hit and run again
Do you think you'll ever play Half Life Alyx?

I have a big pizza for you
I want to see you eat a ghost pepper
I dont remember this game being this hard
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?

I can't wait to see Jerma do the spill joke again
jerma you're making me a psycho, you can't do this
it's the beginning of the second game
I want to see you eat a ghost pepper
you have to get in the water
I want to see you eat a ghost pepper
The game was made by Bethesda, it's the same studio as recently as they were doing a new Fallout game
you're the only person who's playing it
I'm just gonna say it, Jerma is actually a decent person
I'm so glad you're playing this game
You know what else is better than paper clips
You can use your other hero to get to the buildings
you need to do the opposite of the thing
He's gonna fall down the stairs again
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who heard that
Hey how many jumps have you done?
just keep holding it with your index fingers
I wanna be a spy in this chat
I'm just gonna say it, Jerma is actually a decent person and a good person
you're not a true gamer if you don't play online
The game was made by Bethesda, it's the same studio as recently as they were doing a new Fallout game
you can get a good one with this
I'm so glad I was here for the first Jerma stream. I'm so excited to see what he plays.

I was just wondering why you were afraid of showing your feet on stream

You've been playing this for 4 hours
I'm a sub so I can give you money
You can give it to someone you want
There are literally no rules on this game, you just have to do it in a certain order.
I hope you're having a good day
it's gonna be a whole stream of counting
He's gonna get addicted to this game and get divorced jermaPluto
i just got back, what happened to the last game?
this is literally the beginning of the stream
imagine if jerma was just a dog on a trail
I just got here, what is going on
I can't believe Jerma's just been stuck in the tutorial for an hour
I'm a mod and I don't like the game so I'm going to ban you.
you can do it if you just play fortnite :)
Jerma is in the chat and he's screaming
JERMA YOU ARE GOING TO FALL DOWN THE TOILET
can you please just go to the bathroom
I'm not sure, but I'd rather eat a ghost pepper than go to the movies

====================
I wish Jerma would play the PS2 version of this game.
I got a gift sub once and I didnt get any
Jerma should play the Neverhood at some point

You are a 7/10, but you need to eat a whole ass pepper
you can press ctrl+f to instantly get to the next chapter
I'm just happy to see you enjoying a game
i wonder if jerma will ever play a horror game
i think jerma should be allowed to play as a human instead of just a gnome
what are we gonna do if we dont get the shoe?
I'm glad he didn't want to watch a movie with joel
Make sure to take care of Otto too
you're a top 1000 streamer, you can't afford to lose him
you can use the fire, you just have to press it
i will eat my own ass if you do that
its a visual novel with a story
DONT USE YOUR MOUTH YOU'LL GET DOTS

Is there any way to fix it? jermaPluto
what the hell did I just tune into
so you can do the full jermacraft VR stream

it's an emote, it's just like the old twitch emotes
it's like watching a man play video games
I can't believe Jerma doesn't know how to play the game
I think the whole stream is just a little bit of a bit of a bit of a
jermaSun HE'S THE ONE WHO SAID THAT, WERE YOU
is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
you can make a settlement with those
I have a bunch of work to do, but I'm so glad I got to watch this stream jermaHeart

I'm going to have a heart attack if I watch this stream
YOU CAN GO TO THE STORE AND BUY THE BOXES
i just got here and i already know what is going on
I'm sure he'll have enough to give you.
I've never seen you in chat
You have to make the entire town
JERMA IS A CHAD HE DOESNT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY
Iâ€™m so glad Iâ€™m here to see this

We need to find the guy who has to change his name everytime he gets in a car
I don't like that, but I don't mind

it's a picture of you with the turkey on your head
You can just look up the first one
This is what it's like to be a child
how do i skip this part of the video
its not like you can be a millionaire
You should try to find a new town in the same area
you dont need to shoot to see the big guns
You could have just put a bottle over the dog's head
he's gonna fuck up in the second one
I'm gonna go take a shower, I'm sorry

youre making me very angry, please turn off the game
youre the only one who can do that
Why are you wearing a backpack? I think you're a hero

Can we get a "no racism" in chat?
I think you can use the bathroom in this game
You need to be good at this game
I'm going to sleep, you better start the stream or else
what's the difference between a movie and a video game?
this is going to be a very bad stream
why are you so bad at this game?
why does jerma always read the worst comments
The worst part about this game is that you're literally just a chef
I thought you were gonna do the whole game
You don't need to go down to the top of the tower
I just got here what the fuck is going on

you could play the new dr phil game
I thought you were playing this on the ps2
if you get in the car you can drive it
its fine you dont have to be a robot
JERMA NO ONE WANTS YOU TO PLAY THIS
It's a good thing you didn't die to pinwheel

You know what they say about a man with a little boy voice

====================
I know you have a lot of friends
This is how Jerma feels when he gets hit by a car
Jerma is just using his "I didn't do anything" speech to make himself look bad
I would hate to be your friend
you should play the whole game now
You're making a lot of noise dude
you have to go to the other side of the mountain to get it
I've never seen a room like this
hey jerma if you're reading this just know that I'm really really really into it and I'll be okay with it
This is why we dont talk about the Jerma stream anymore
you can see the tears in his eyes
he's not going to stop streaming until you do it
Did you get the boots from the game?
can we get a "F" in chat for the red and blue :)
LUL I feel like I'm having a stroke
I hope you have a great day, Jerma

I hope you know I just joined and I'm a big fan of your streams
this game is only for the DLC

I heard a rumor that you can't buy the boots because they're too expensive. Would you be interested in seeing what happens?
jerma please play the music this is really helping
dont forget to check your items and equip them
You're playing a game where you can't aim your guns
this is the worst thing you've ever done
i love how the game is just a bunch of generic action figures
this is a weird game why is there a quest
what are you going to do with the $50
I just got here, is this supposed to be a puzzle game?

====================
how long is this joke going on for
jerma is a robot so he can do the voices
if you want to know what the secret boss is just try to look at the map
I think you're gonna get stuck on the first part of the level
You can only get it if you pay the toll @Jerma985
you're not a real gamer unless you have a gamer license
can we do the funny chicken joke again?
you have to finish the game again
it's gonna be like that one game where you're a kid playing with his toy

I think you're doing a good job at not making the bad decisions
You're doing a great job. A GREAT JOB

you have to play it for at least a week
i can't believe you did that to my father
dont forget to get your water filter
you can't just leave the house you dummy
I think you can be any of a number of things
HE'S STILL IN THE SLOW MODE LUL LUL
You have to beat this game with your own hands
You're gonna lose to a pinwheel game PogChamp
this is the best stream youve ever done
You should really invest in a cow bowl

Theres a glitch where you can buy more masks
You can use the spear to kill the dragon
You can use a bow and arrow to hunt and you can shoot at a higher rate
You can turn on a flashlight in the options
you have a single usb controller that you can use to play this game
you know that game of thrones episode where they get arrested for tax evasion
I thought you were gonna finish it OMEGALUL
you could play it with the controller
why don't you just play the game
you should just do a full playthrough of this game
it's all a ploy to get you to play more of the new games
you can look up what it's like to be an ant
Jerma you should play the GTA online casino
when are you going to play as Sans?
you have to go to the other room
jerma please start the stream, i have to get to bed

You can get the chests by grinding the rocks
jermaJex jermaJex2 can you please be my personal mod?
I'm not sure what to say to that
Jerma this is your doctor, he can't read chat
You can't even see it with the binoculars
I'm glad you're playing this, it's one of my favorite games
get the mic to mute the game audio
you can change the music with the bttv addon
you can go back to the main menu
Oh my god he's still on the same level
why is this the same song over and over
what is this "joke" you're making
I think I heard the audio in a different voice
Hey, I just wanted to say that you are very handsome. I like your hair.
Jerma, please, you are the only streamer I'll watch this year
you are the only streamer i watch
you could just make him a monkey and have him be happy
you don't have to grind up the rocks
You have to tell them to stop
this is the guy who beat pinwheel on stream?
You have to do the game's tutorial, it's worth it
jerma you're the only streamer I'll watch this year

put a bed on top of the fireplace so you can hide in there
I'LL TAKE A SHIT ON YOUR HEAD
you look like a child mowing a lawn
jerma you're gonna get so mad at this game
if you beat it it's not even worth it
i dont know what any of these do
If you want to go into the closet, you should try the first level of the next level.
I'm so glad you're playing this game Jerma :)

You can use it to get to the edge of the universe
Jerma, you are the best, please do not take this anymore, it is not worth it
didnt he say he was gonna do a hulk game again?
i think theres a reason why its called the hulk game
you have to get it on the other side
how do you do that with a controller
JERMA IF YOU DONT STOP THE STREAM RIGHT NOW I WILL CRY
that's the one that gets you to the edge of time
you have to beat the game in first person, it's a lot easier if you don't have a second controller
You are a true gamer, you know that?
i'm so glad you're playing this jermaHeart
You need to eat a whole turkey to make it to the top of the food chain
I think you need to take a break

Hey Jerma, if you don't beat it tonight, you have to play it
this is like a nightmare i had the whole time
Jerma why did you choose to play this game
There is a thing in the menu that is just for you
theres a part in the game where you can speedrun this game
I think you might be able to get an A-
Is this the streamer that was banned from twitch for playing Nancy Drew?
Why does this game look so much worse than the last one

jerma i love you but theres no way youre going to beat this game
you can use it to get to the edge of time
why do you have so many shirts
How are you so bad at this game
this game is just a cheap knockoff of last year's shooter
@Jerma
====================
I have no idea how he did that
YOU NEED TO START OVER WITH THE SHADOW
you just have to build a new town and fill in all the gaps
your character looks like a character from Iron Man
there's no way you'll beat this game in one go
You can tell when people are being weird by the way they say the word
You need to get the other ending
jerma you've been here for 5 hours and you're still in the same place
can you turn up the volume on your mic?
i have a corsa headache and i can't hear it anymore

I got it for my 13 year old son.
hey is this what you do in your free time?
This is what happens when you don't have the boots
THEY DIDNT EVEN TRY TO CHEAT YOU DUMB IDIOT
This game was made by the same team
you can't get to the first level without the boots
you can use the spear to stab them
what are the rules of this game?
why are you doing this to us
its because you're not a child and you hate this game
you can buy the boots from the merchant
Jerma please play the new game, it's called Paper Mario
there is a secret level to get boots
you can just go to the other side and attack the one that you didn't save
The only way to win is not to play
you can just make a new town and fill in all the gaps in the existing one

jerma you're a good guy, you deserve to die
I think I have a bad case of the rib problem
It's almost like I'm not a real gamer
I think you can use your special attack
is this the guy that beat the game on stream?
can you just go to the store and sell it
the guy on the right has a gun
it was a good idea to play it
you can just hit the dude in
====================
I am so glad to see this game still.
I can't believe you'd do this to us jerma
you should play the game it's called Space Channel 5
you were supposed to be in the closet
This is the most hype train stream in a while
you are going to get banned for posting that
I think he just can't take this anymore
you can see how much they sweat on the monitor
Are you going to do the "Boomer Game" stream?
that was a cool joke, now we can go back to the duck game
if you dont do it in one go youre a coward
can you do the click to speak voice please
You don't have to play this again
I heard you said you were doing a "lleyo"
this is the most fun I've had watching a stream
I can't believe I watched this live, I feel like I've missed out on a real life Jerma
I have a feeling that you can do this
I dont want to be the one guy
you need to get a new mic
You need to play the game to see the ending
I remember when Jerma said he was going to do a stream where he would go to the bathroom and come back and do this again
theres a video of a stream where you did the voices
you can turn it off and on again
this is a lot like a radio stream
It's going to be the same song again
If you die to the other zombies in the tutorial, you die to the boss in real life
why are you playing a video game?
this is like the "you can't do this" joke
i'll be back in like 10 min :)
you don't have to do it for free
the only way to win is not to play the game
are you ever gonna play the second game
i wonder what jerma's goin to be today
i'm so happy to see the stream even though i don't have a sub
I'm just waiting for Jerma to finally finish the game
you're a fucking psychopath you know that
this is the one that got me into boston
you cant get more than a thousand dollars
you should go to the store and buy some more
he is gonna play the game like "what the fuck"
The first level has a locked door, use it
you can use the slow mo to skip the cutscene
there is a cheat code for this game
He's gonna be playing the game for 7 hours
you can have a high iq with chat
is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel on stream?
What if you had to leave your car?
I thought you were gonna play more Kenshi?
I remember when Jerma said he was gonna do a stream where he would play a game where he would pretend to be a real person
I'm from the future, and I can tell you that the dream is a lie
JERMA PLEASE DONT DO THIS TO ME AGAIN
YOU CAN'T KILL THEM WITH THE BOSS EITHER
jerma you are so bad at this game
jermaOtto jermaHeart jermaHeart jermaHeart <3 <3 jermaHeart <3
have you tried the Wii Sports 3ds?
I don't know who that is but I'm glad they are here.
theres a secret in the center of the room
I'd like to see Jerma do a cooking stream
I'm so excited to see how this turns out
you can get a new mic if you don't have one
he isnt even a dog he is a dog
"I'm sorry, my son, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
you cant be serious if you dont know what is happening
jermaOld I want to have a nice vacation
You have to get the keycard to get the ending
have you ever played any of the classic Halo games?
you have to go back and pick up the red portal
Jerma has a brand new mic. He's just got to do this one
if you don't finish the game right now I'm going to puke
i have no idea what a jerma stream is
make one of those "and you
====================
this is what happens when you dont read chat
YOU NEED TO GO BACK FOR THE BOSS
can you say "we love u" and not "we hate you"
jerma is really using a gamer chair right now
this game has a lot of stuff you need to know
please do another challenge stream with etalyx
this is a jup storm, you have to be ready to react
you can only go in the room with the elevator
this is a game where you have to figure out the puzzles
you have to get a new account and a sub
Jerma this is your mother speaking, you can't play this
you need to get a new controller :)
is this the streamer who did that cooking stream?
He can't hear us, he's got airpods in
what do you think of the new Star Wars movie?
Can you play the new Animal Crossing OST please?
what if you made your own house?
You know what the fuck, Jerma, you need to stop
this is just a rerun of the same level
You have to be in the "A" range
you need to be in the "A" range
you're gonna be hearing that in your sleep
I think he's gonna have a heart attack
why does your character look like a bandit
that's what you get for not having a pet
"dont worry i have a great time"
play animal crossing new horizons or i will cry
You need to play the game in order to beat it
Jerma you're just a bad joke that makes no sense
You have to shoot the red thing to get the green
you can go to the store and buy a new gun, and then the next day you can get the blue one
I can't believe Jerma is playing a video game
YOU NEED TO DO A NEW GUY
you have to touch the ring to get it
I hope we can get a new Jerma Rumble
just buy a new one and play it on stream
Why is this guy wearing a backpack OMEGALUL
You didn't beat the last boss, you're fucking BULLIED
this game is actually so good holy shit
jerma you can use the jetpack to move faster
I cant wait for the vod to be muted
Jerma, you have a big glass of water and you're still peeing
This is how you get a bad gamer license
you should do a room with no doors
i want to see you play this game
Jerma is gonna play a different game tonight LUL
You have to put the food on the floor or else they'll just eat it
I can't believe you've been playing this game for so long
you can also make your own water source by making a pump
put the big ass axe on top of the mountain
this is just a horror game LUL
its not like you're really having fun
I don't know what is worse, the game or the stream.
i can't believe you got banned from twitch for this
Hey Jerma, just got here, what's going on?
I'd like to see you play the game in the same order as the game
You don't have to hit him to win
Your camera is so far out of focus
i dont know what its like to be old
hey jerma play the game it's called, it's a good game
I can't believe you think this is a good game
i would bet a dollar that you'll die to pinwheel in like 5 seconds
did he really play that level for 5 hours?
"Don't hurt me, don't hurt me" - Jerma985
I'm sure the only way to get to the top is to go through the store
You don't need to jump on the red thing
The entire chat is just a bunch of teenagers
I'm sorry Jerma but I'm gonna be really disappointed if you don't play a card game today
it's not that bad if you don't use the bow
is this the game where you can make people go bald?
I'm getting sleepy, have you guys heard of this guy called Jerma985?
you can use the rocket launcher on the ship
you can check the top of the screen
@
====================
 I just came back after like 20 mins and I'm still pissed
there are so many jerma vids out there
he is a big fan of the late 90s
you should probably stop playing this game, its boring as fuck
the only thing that has made me happy is when my dad beat me
this is a lot easier than the first level
is this what a Jerma stream looks like
that's a lot of money to buy a mansion
YOU HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING AND DO IT
he's just pretending to be bad at the game
i think you have to go to the closet to get the boots
you have to put the gta casino in the background
The game is about to start and Jerma is already losing his mind
That is a shame, you should have made it up to us
jerma will you be streaming for the next 6 months?
There are no more deaths in this game, it's just a tutorial
the only thing I know about halo is that it's not open world
jerma is mad because he cant hear us
I'm so glad he's back to playing the new games
why are you so obsessed with this game
Jerma is a big boy and his mom is a little girl
I got this game on PS1 and the code was in my name.
this is just the Simpsons Hit and Run but with actual football
i wouldnt be surprised if theres a single jerma in this game
this is just a really short version of the game
how is this game so much fun to watch
Can you make a tier list for the best games
you're just being mean to this chat member
you need to play as two guys
Hey, how much longer do you think the stream will be?
theres a room down there, its for storage
I just got here, is Jerma doing a Funko Pop Stream?
if you want to see a video just watch that one
this is the first time i've ever seen someone actually use jerma's chat
why do you have a full head of hair?
Play a different game, you can't stop us
you can get a boost if you level up
You have to buy the house with your channel points
If you have a spare mouse you can use it
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH IT
I'm afraid you don't know what a "stinky" is
you can get a free ublock in the shop
you can upgrade the weapon to a better one
"I'll just get a new mouse" - Jerma
You have to shoot the dog to save the game
If you're good at something never do it for free
you can get a free ublock in the shop
would you rather eat a whole lasagna or eat a whole lasagna
i feel like jerma is just being a goth goth
you can get a free ublock in the shop
I'm getting a headache from this game LUL
I know you can play the first one on the disc, but it's not a good game
i bet that was a good joke LUL
You can use it as a crafting table
I didn't know this was a horror game
can you play the old sims 2 ost please?
This game is way better than the first one
dont worry about it you can do it
you don't have to make all the models
you have to eat the fish now
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE MANSION
You can use it to craft a rocket launcher
you look like a drunk guy from a few years back
the only reason i like it is because of the design
HE'S NOT STILL IN THE FUCKING GROUND OMEGALUL
YOU HAVE TO USE THE RING, IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU USE THE RING
That guy is gonna make you pay for the insurance
you can get a free ublock in the shop
you can get a free ublock in the shop
the only one that matters is you
HE'S JUST A GNOME, WE'RE ALL THE GNOMEs
The only thing that matters is that you die.
It's the only way to save your life
this is what happens when you don
====================
Are you sure it's not just me
I think you can break a guy's legs if you don't have enough strength
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, see you later
did jerma ever say what game he was going to play today?
so far i've only gotten one sub jermaPluto
you know you can buy an actual box right?
you're just going to make the whole place go up
I think it's because you didn't buy a new controller
You can do it in the pen
if you have a gun, you can shoot people
I'm going to eat a piece of this shirt
you know what they say about big balls?
That's what happens when you sit down and play for 2 hours
you know what jerma? you are still a god gamer
I thought it was a big mac right
jermaSun i'm not gonna tell you how to do it
You're the only person in the room, you can't be late
I just got here, did Jerma eat a shoe?
I hope Jerma plays this game and doesn't just play it for the next 3 hours
I'm not sure if I want to see this
what if i give you a million bits?
jermaOld I remember when Jerma was a good boy
what the fuck is wrong with you
you're not the only one who is gonna die
You should check out the new star wars game
Chat has Bashed 22 Seagulls, use !bash to help
jerma has been live for channel is not live
your brain is so small you need a magnifying glass
Jerma the real question is what's the point of this game
you guys are all mimics, copying everything someone says
i wish i was a mod :( I'm just a mod
jermaOld jermaOld I'm in my 40s and I can't play anymore jermaOld
you have to do the boss fight in the arena
if you want to see how the game works play this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p-HnKp3xg
you can find the first "steal" by looking for a group of guys named "Gandalf" and talking to him
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
It's not like you're the only one who's got it.
i'm pretty sure you're missing the coin
you can do the other thing
I'm back, why are you still playing this?
Hey Jerma, it's me, the director of "Dr. Smoixan"
Jerma, you have to get the boots to get the next mission
I'm glad he's not playing this anymore PepeHands
I can't believe he's playing the same game for the next 8 hours
I'm really disappointed in you, Jerma. You're such a good streamer.
you're not a real fan if you don't have a birthday
I can't wait for the carnival stream FeelsGoodMan Clap
I can't believe Jerma would do this to us
Would you do the dlc for the other games?
this is like a kid getting their homework done
i wish i was as good at video games as jerma is
what do you think of the new pet rat?
we should have a timeout for this jerma
jerma why are you playing this game you know you're gonna do this
Jerma can you please explain the game to me, its really boring
what if we kissed in the jerma stream? ðŸ˜³
YOU WERE JUST A GUY YOU WERE IN THE SHOP
Oh my god he's still going this is so much
I bet he never even got to the final boss LUL
jermaWalk I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS jermaWalk
the AI is kinda way ahead of it
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ HE'S A MAN IN THE WALL jermaChomp
I am now officially a sub jermaGrin jermaGrin
have you ever been to a park in your life?
how does it feel to be the #1 TF2 streamer?
you can go to the second floor of the basement
you can just walk around in the snow
I was gonna post a clip of it but I forgot to post the entire stream, can you please play it?
its like the original nancy drew in the rumble
@Jer
====================
TheIlluminati
you need to get the boots for the DLC
you can just play the game with an emulator
I just got here, is he doing the same thing again?
youre going to get so mad at this game
he has an extra arm, you can use that to get up and get into the car
Hey Jerma, how about that "I'm your dad" joke?
what are the chances of a spill joke?
jerma you're making me pogchamp right now jermaPluto
you can just get one of those
are you going to play the new smash brothers?
This is just the dark souls of a first person game
you can use it to get up and get into the car
i think you mean "DO NOT USE THE FIREBALL"
Hey I just wanted to say I love you and that I hope you never leave this chat ever again.
you should play more sam and max
the last time you went to a restaurant you had to call someone to order a plate of food
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
you should play the new smash brothers, it's the best one
i think i know what that is but i dont know what it is
Just play this with your neighbors and see what happens
You can get the boots by the way
you have to do a regular voice
you have to go into the other side
you can get the boots by the way
you can just copy the text to save time
Do you know how many bits are in the wallet?
You know what they say about a man who knows how to take a hot air balloon
there are only a few ppl who have done that
I hope jerma is still playing this LUL
You should probably check the main menu, it has some mods you can look at
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what a jpeg is
he has to buy a bunch of gourmet meals
why is this game so fucked up?
I'm just here for the vod, and I really like it
Play the mario yahtzee music you cowards
this is the most generic game ever made
you can just copy the text to save time
you could have been playing the game
that's why you don't drink from the fountain
what if you find the last room in the house?
I'm gonna go get a drink and watch the stream.
you can find a table at the bottom of the screen
theres a table in the second floor
i think its just a thing you need to add more
did you know that you can fly?
jerma you need to be in the right mindset
just use the voice of the guy from the dark knight rises
Theres a table at the bottom of the screen
you have to get more from the tree
PLEASE play the game i want to watch
This is just the original Dead Space.
I just came here what the fuck is going on
This is a fucking disaster, Jerma, please stop
I think it's time for a change of scenery
DONT WORRY GUYS HE HAS A SOCKS LMAO
this game is so good and you know it
How can you not like it? It's got candy!
You can use it to get up and get into the car.
you can look at the logbook to see how to use the bike
you have to go into the other side
if you die in the game you die in real life
have you seen the new cooking mama video?
the house is in the sky
I remember when Jerma was playing Mario Maker 2 on the Dreamcast
Jerma you are so bad at this game
imagine if jerma was real and he was naked
you have to get a lockpick and a bunch of stuff
I hope this is the last stream ever
you have to get the boots to get the boots
this is the worst stream of the year
that's why you use it to get up and get into the car
It's a good thing you got that thing
====================
i just got here can you pause the stream?
I feel like you just saw a car crash in this game
It's not really a game, it's just a TV show
it is, the character is also a cartoon character
i would love a dos game right now
i'm sure you can just use the one guy voice
just get the boots, they're pretty cheap :)
There is an easter egg in this level
i have to go to bed, goodnight everyone
you can skip the first part of the game and save the rest
do you have a range of how many tickets you want to give out?
do you know about the hidden room in the room with the chair?
he didnt even know he had a gun
I'm just here for the OST, not the game
I've never seen a streamer so bad at this game
I love how much they were trying to make this a fun game, but it was really not that fun
I remember when I had a fully working phat ass as a kid
this is like the dark souls of mario
Jerma is a GAMER and we all know it
you can get the boots in this game
Play some dark souls games tonight
you should go to the mountain and fight the cavemen, they are very good
have you ever played the new pokemon games
you can use your channel points to buy new socks
its not a video, its a game
you can change the camera, you don't need to aim
you can use the sniper scope to kill them all
its a joke about the guy in the closet
you can use your channel points to buy new socks
I'm gonna go watch the VOD tommorow, it's pretty good
I'm getting real sick of this game
I bet he's just making a wish for the game awards
How much would it cost to rent out the front of your house?
I remember when he said he had to stream it
I'm sorry I'm late, but I can't tell you how I feel
you can see the gasses in his stomach
have you ever been in a restaurant and people are literally screaming and farting
I can't believe he's still playing this game
this is just the original Dead Space, with a new engine
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8
oh god oh fuck theres a tornado in the sky
You need to find a new backpack
I think you can make your own pawns with the pawn skill
you can't just pick up the food without having to go into the kitchen
jerma is actually a gamer now, he's playing the game for fun
you know what they say about a gamer with a big brain?
This is a children's game. The guy is literally just a fucking robot
why is he so obsessed with this game
please tell us about the time you got a stroke
why are you so bad at the game
jermaOld oh my god i have to go to bed
He's a video game streamer, he's gonna be late
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, I'll see you all later
There's a way to get out of the map
I'm so glad you can't make a good game
jerma just like he promised us he would play this
you need to do the purple leash to heal
why are you doing the poo poo joke again
you can see the blood in his stomach
You can do the Nude Ritz challenge, it's a game about running a dating app.
I'm gonna have a heart attack from laughing
you can just tell a guy to type something
this is the same streamer who beat the shit out of his computer in an arcade
jermaSour when you don't know what a penis is
"I don't know" - Jerma, after that one time he died
this is the best thing youve ever done
imagine the mods are just going to leave their base and come back
i'm glad you're not getting mad at this game
@Jerma
====================
i'm just here to make jerma laugh :)
I hope he plays the new Zelda game
how many channel points for you to eat a shoe
this is the most boomer thing i've ever heard
The eye of the universe is closed jermaSun
you need to talk to the woman
That was a really good joke, thank you!
that was the worst bit of the year
you need to beat it on stream so we know what youre talking about
he was playing it with etalyx the whole time
When is the next green screen stream?
its a baby you can get pregnant
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -144. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i dont have a switch yet im gonna jump off a bridge
I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
you dont have to buy it, just bring it
jermaSour when you don't know what a pie is
This is the most fucked up stream I've ever watched
I'm not sure he knows what the game is
Jerma if you don't stream soon I'm gonna scream
can we get a "1 hour slowmode" for the stream
you can also pick up and drop items in this game
i can't believe you died to pinwheel
you can see a centimeter in the top left
I'm sorry Jerma, I didn't mean to say it
You should check out the Deep Rock Galactic amazing game that came out today
is it true you have a 6th grade education
jerma just look at the top left jerma
jerma you can't just say no to people asking you to play the game
why are you wearing a full headwrap
I'm not sure if it's just me or the game is a little off
The only way to win is not to play
there's a clip of the guy dying on stream
I'm gonna eat my own ass for this stream
you need to get more heroes for the other zones
i dont know what this is but its great
you can't just tell us you like it
Jerma would you ever consider playing a new game?
Will you play the new Stardew Valley?
I think he's going to end up playing that game
This is like a 2d version of a 3d model
I'm sorry I can't hear you in the next room
This is the most detailed graphics I've seen
you could be the new TF2 Scout
this is like the scariest game ever LUL
you know it's a game about money and games
I just got here what the fuck is this
it's a good game if you get into it
it's a really good idea for a stream
you need to use the flame thrower in this fight
you should be able to beat the level in the tutorial
You got me into this game, I hate you
You have to do the dishes or else you'll get sued
You can probably beat this level without boots
why do you still have the boomer brace
You know it's bad if you get a positive score but bad if you don't
You can't just tell us what you want to play. We'll pretend to care for you.
You have to get to the end of the game first
you have to get the boots to win
if you were a giant enemy spider, what would you be?
do you have any tips on cleaning up your shit?
you should get a different person to play it
You should have gone for the head, it's a higher damage
can you say that I am a sick fuck?
you can literally make a whole game out of this
You have to find the middle of the road
you can also pick up and drop items in this game
you're gonna get hit by a car in the other room
I am going to kill you with my bare hands
I have a pair of socks, they're great
why is there a torch on the top left
you can also pick up and drop items in this game
I'm playing mine
====================

put the hair on your head to reveal your hairless face
I had a dream about you in a carnival and you were just standing there in a sandals and screaming
put on the carnival music for the rest of the stream
I want to see jerma play the Vinesauce soundtrack
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I would say a few days to the day after, but that's just me.
I'm in the middle of a huge roundabout
Can you do the robot voice over again?
You have to do it to the end
use the catapult to open the door
you can't say its not the right way
you have to get to the top of the tree
i'm new to this stream, is this the same game as last time?
You can see the rage in his eyes
that's a lot of points for you to get a new car
jerma im gonna go into the bathroom, please start the stream
I can't wait for the real game :)
that's why you're so good at it
you're a professional karate master, you're gonna need a lot of practice to master this one
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 no jups for a long time jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I've never had a cold before in my life.
I'm gonna have a heart attack if he plays this again
I don't want to hear that voice again
I will never forgive you for your crimes
i want to see jerma play minecraft :(
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DIDNT GET BANNED FROM THE THING
my dad just got the internet fixed at home, he still doesnt have it

What's your favorite kind of tomato soup
Just take a look at the bottom right
I can't believe jerma is actually cheating on us
I love that you keep the room clean, it's actually great
Why don't you just get a new mouse?
I think it's just a bug with the camera
he doesn't even know what a jpeg is LUL
i bet you're the only one with a keyboard
you can get a lot of good loot in this game, you can just get a lot of bad loot
I wish I could just take a dump like that
you gotta do another one, this time with the same mechanics
I'd like to see him play that red dead redemption game
why do you always say the n word
jermaSun I'm just here to watch the vod, not actually to read the chat
I can't believe you got shot by a drone, please make the VOD over

This game is the best thing to happen to this stream
Jerma you have to do a voice changer

The same people who made that game got paid $50
I am so excited for the stream to start
I have never seen anyone so bad at a game
jermaOld you can't just ignore chat. We're here for you! jermaOld

I'm out of the loop on the first game, it's been 5 hours
He doesn't know you're streaming, he's just making fun of you
I would have beaten this game without the boots

please do a facecam so we can laugh at you
He was a real clown, he could be anywhere
You need to use the secret room in the closet
this is a boomer game, play the baby game
I think he might be in a coma
I just got here. Is this game boring?
He has a dog, what the fuck is this
that's not how it works, you just have to say it
this is the worst thing to come out of this game
The amount of clicks is based on the number of viewers, not the time it takes you to do it
you could just send him back to the last floor
i like how the other guy is literally a robot
you can check if the other guy is still alive
theres a random set of walls you can see
you should play the new doom ost
i'd rather be a virgin than be a mother
you can get to the final level
do you know how many times jerma has been banned?
jerma i have to go to bed soon can you start the stream
theres like 4 games in this game i think
just open the game and type "game over"
Is this the guy that beat Dark Souls on stream?
you can tell you're gonna be late when you're at the end of the stream if you don't do the boss
this is like a mmo version of the pacman game

did you try turning it off and on again?
The Pawn is on the lower right
I wish he would come back to the stream :(

They are looking for a lost cat
It's the same game as the last one, but it's got some new features
Why is he so fucking confused about the japanese accent LUL
I'm gonna be watching this for the rest of my life
The same devs that made the sonic game
i want to see you get strangled to death
what if they have a full moon on the 21st
YOU LITERALLY COULDN'T EVEN DO THE LAST LEVEL
The only way to get the real ending is to try to get the DLC
What about the new mic you have
this game is way too easy for you
Have you seen that one dog at the zoo?
I'm not gonna lie, this looks pretty cool
You're gonna need to install the game now
theres a secret room in the closet you can sneak in
you need to go to the end of the game
this is like the dark souls of kinect games
this guy is gonna have a mental breakdown
I can't believe Jerma is a cancer patient
You can turn off the console and back on again
i would buy a funko pop if it werent for the cost of 1 month

YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
i hope you can find
====================
I'm a bit of a Jerma watcher myself
i hate that jerma is a streamer now
the worst part about the nancy drew streams is that you couldnt even tell what the game was supposed to be
I wish I could live on a beach
it looks like the thing from the first game
you can just click on the old one
You're just a character created by the dev, they're all in this game
I think you can get a good weapon if you do it right
I can't believe you died to pinwheel
you have to go to the store and buy another one
you can also use the mushroom mushroom to craft stuff
jerma you have to pay the taxes, you have to pay the court
you have to buy the mansion first then sell it
What if you're a new viewer and have no idea what you're talking about
that's why you're the only streamer who can play this game
I can't believe I'm watching the stream without my headphones off
This game is for people who are bored
that was the worst joke of the decade
do a backflip to the right of the screen
Why are you playing a horror game?
you can't have a happy meal without a salad
just like in the movies, you have to win
you could have gotten a double kill on that boss
you can just take the fish and leave
I'm not a fan of you but I hope you're having fun!
I don't think you can get it in the game.
its time to give up on this game
This is like a 3d model of you
I'm going to watch the entire VOD. I'm going to take a shower, come back and you're still streaming.
I dont think this is what it is
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
I can't believe you would lie to us
why did he put the camera in the room?
Jerma you need to get the boots and get through this level
are you gonna play more of this?
it's a good game but it's not for everyone
if you want to see my favorite meme of all time iâ€™m on youtube
I'm not going to lie, this game looks pretty good.
The only time I've seen a house that was built in this style was the last level of Monarch.
what did you do to your dog?
imagine if you had a jerma sub badge
I love how the music changes with the time
this is a bit much for me, but it's not really worth it
play simpsons hit and run instead :)
you should get a real gun and just shoot the zombies
You're gonna die to Pinwheel, you should try to get a gun
i just got here and i have no idea what's going on
Have you heard of a new game called "The Monkey"?
if you had a cat you would be a great cat
have you ever played the new games?
I just got here, is this a childrens game?
that's the same thing as when you got a quarterstaff
If you don't play a better game than this I'm gonna be really mad
you could have just played the other one
You don't need to put up a fence
I think this is the worst stream of the year
Jerma is this how you get on to the stream?
This is a great game, not sure if it's as good as the others
You don't need to be a Boomer to know the game
did he just get his eyes surgically removed
you can just press the button to speak in the game
you're the reason we have this problem
you should play the new BBS game, it's on the Epic store right now
I can't wait for the next one LUL
This is a lot of work for a game with a bunch of buttons
you dont even need to have the game running, just turn it off and back on again
how long does it take to get into the bathtub?
you can do it. I believe in you
they're going to come for you and you're not gonna believe it
You should play the other game, this one's a bit better
you're playing this for the first time and you're
====================
just look at the other side of the water
You know the problem is you have the best hands right
do you have any plans for more Kenshi?
it's a fucking surprise for you jerma
I made a joke about a fake frog and you said it in a private moment
I'm so glad you're not doing this now
I'm gonna be honest, I don't really care for this game, but this is cool
you just need to do the same thing over and over again
its like a really small square on the screen
the only game you know how to play is you
If you have a gun, you can shoot your teammate.
remember when you said you'd play that mr bean game on stream
i dont have that much time, can you do the coin game for me
this is why you are the best streamer
i dont think i have ever seen someone so bad at video games
you can use a wrench to remove a chunk of floorboard
if you don't get it it's not worth it
have you ever played the doom ost?
how is this game supposed to be played?
i think you have to have a bunch of health to do it
I think the streamer is kinda tired of this game
you can do a quick end to end stream
you can use the mouse to control the hud
"I'm getting a job at the end of this month"
hey guys I'm a new viewer here :)

I'm the only one who's ever played this game
Jerma what's the best way to eat a ghost pepper?
this is why you have a back brace
you can use the wrench to remove a chunk of floorboard
just press buttons to grab them :)
I've been wanting to see you play Sekiro, but you're too busy playing it to see that game :)
I love how he just started a new game
make it so you can just do the same thing over and over again
that's a real thing, that's what you do
I'm in the bathroom. You should probably stop.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO KILL THE HEDGE
this is the most jerma stream I've ever watched
they're called bloodborne bosses because they have a fucking lightning attack
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SAY THE WORD
YOU COULD LIKE TO SEE ME GIVE YOU AN OIL BAG
it's like watching a child play this
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
it's just a code that says something like this
I was just checking on you, but I'm not sure what's happening
I dont know if I should be ashamed of myself
its like jerma hasnt played in like 2 years
JERMA YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN USE THE TUBER CAMERA
I made this game when I was a kid.
I hate this game so much I can't stop farting

You're on the front page of twitch right now

Just do a prerecorded stream for the last 2 hours
you can just put the tesla in the box
What if you can't reach the top shelf of the fridge?
You have to collect at least 75,000 points to win the game.

Just remember that this game is free on the switch and you can play it on your own.

You can play as the two dogs
I wish I could be this much of a dork

"Jerma is now in violation of the MEGA MILK rule. You are now in violation of the MEGA MILK rule"
I'm not sure what the fuck is going on

It's a bit hard to watch a game for the first time but you're doing a great job.
jerma you can't turn off the audio please
Can you please sing a lullaby for us?
you need to add a small amount of salt
I'm not sure I like this game as much as this game

theres a way to get the other one for 100 dollars
you are the only person to have that voice
you gotta get the other one for 50 dollars
It's because you're not on a plane anymore
The time it took for you to do that
It's a bit hard to watch a game for the first time but you're doing a GREAT job.
how is the game so bad, but not the most recent
I think you need to get the other one for 50 dollars
You can't sell your house to

It's okay, I'm just having a hard time finding the right moment to hit the buttons
you're not even 30 minutes in and you're already on time
This is the only reason I'm here
do a stream where you play the game
you're in the right place, just take it easy
Do you know why the last game was so good?

You were saying you'd do the voice
He's the guy that's supposed to get you out of the basement

this is the last time you'll be able to play this game
this is a good game, this game is just boring
you can use the boots to get the boots
Jerma is literally a bad actor in this game
This game is way better than a lot of the other ones
This is the hardest Iâ€™ve ever seen a man play a game.
do you have any plans on playing any other games today?
i have to watch jerma die on stream
remember when you said you had a 5k a year ago
I want you to play this game for a week
what is the best game
====================
Jerma, I don't know if you realize this but you're streaming from your new office
you gotta find the pin from the lab
theres a hook in the box if you hold it
why does the cow look like a prune plant
just play the entire game in the background
you can get it from the drug store
theres a knife in there and he doesnt even care
you can buy it from the drug store for like $5
so you don't have to clean your house every night
I can't believe Jerma is playing the same game over and over again
This is the game that makes you hate everything
there's a reason you had the money to make this game
jerma your character looks like he's wearing a wig
If you're so good at something never do it for free
this is like the end of the game
It's like that one movie where all the kids are just in their parents basement
you should play the new fighting game
"I'm so glad I didn't get hit"
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
you look like a piece of shrek
You should have known what you were doing
use the new spell to negate negative numbers
hey jerma play the newest game the new game
you can see the sweat on his face
There's an alternate universe where you were the one who wrote that
try the new level "GRAB" it's like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCw2t7y2U
Can we have a 5 minute slow mode please?
You should do a playthrough of the first game
Jerma you're the only streamer I watch jermaHeart
you have to do a roll to the right
Jerma, I can't believe you actually hate the game
why are you making these noises so much?
jerma is a streamer, he is not a chatter
I'm really tired of your shitposting, you better not have any more of my shitposting
You gotta find the secret card on the bottom right of the screen
You're gonna get a heart attack
if you dont finish this level i'm gonna lose my mind
You can use the rainbow leash on the dog to help her out
That's what happens when you get addicted to gambling
you are in the store with your mom
you can click to skip the cutscene
You need to be careful when you step on the poison vineStank
it's a good game, you should play it again
it's a little less than a year
do you remember that scene from the old dark souls game where they shoot him with the shotgun
I think you need to be in the sewer
Please go back to the first game I think you missed a lot of stuff
I can't believe he's fucking dead jermaPluto jermaPluto
You've got a pretty good sense of humor
Jerma if you're having fun just play the game
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure you're the most genuine streamer on Twitch
he is taking a break from fighting this game
"You didn't do anything wrong" - Jerma985
jerma you have to play the game or i'll fucking eat my own ass
what's the worst joke that took more than 5 minutes
jerma you're an old man and you can't even read this
this is what the "streamer" is like to talk
theres a secret room under the ship
Jerma can you say "I love you" again
theres a secret room under the ship
do you know what aight is? jermaOld
is that the one you saw in the dentist?
you can play as many as you want and you can have the same time
you can use the leash to walk on land
are you gonna play the new Half Life?
I know it's an old joke but he's right
you can see the sweat on his face
are you going to do the katamari stream again?
YOU CAN PICK UP THE LEFT HAND TO
====================
please do the Cooking Mama voice for the rest of the stream
Can't believe they gave him a big mac
but I've never seen someone so good at a game
it was the hardest i've laughed in a long time
that's not how you type it either LUL
I'm pretty sure they have a different version of the game
you can tell jerma's not tall because he's not a gamer
you could have just moved to a new house
i've been playing the game for 3 hours and i still haven't gotten the boots
why did jerma get rid of the middle one?
you have to get your own place in the world
The rest of the game is going to be a bunch of people
I'm so glad I didn't miss that bit
it's just a level on the first level
if you're so smart why are you still doing this
is this the streamer that played for 7 hours on stream?
this is what happens when you don't eat your vegetables
You can have a sub sound if you want
if you can't beat the game you're a fake gamer
they will only attack you if you try to fight them
I can't believe you're a gamer jermaPluto
It's like a slow motion boss fight OMEGALUL
you can't go back to the lab if you haven't already
jerma is the top cop of this city
you need to turn it off in the middle of a fight
You can use a portal to the underworld to get the tickets
i don't think it was supposed to be this way
YOU CAN JUST USE THE PRERECORDED TRAFFICKER
this is the best game ive ever seen
i'm trying to learn how to do my taxes and i just want to know how to do it
I'm waiting for my favorite streamer to stream for like 3 hours
I'm not even gonna go to the bathroom
I think they used to just do this in the movies
You can do it, you have to.
jerma, you're the only one who gets to see me get eaten
You'll never be able to play this game
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
Why does your character look like a fucking baby
jerma is a smart streamer, we're just lucky
You are the only one that gets to see me get eaten
you have to put the axe back in
this is gonna be like a week long shitpost
play this game again, it was fun
you could have just gone to the dumpster
Dude, that was a good one, you're not even in the game anymore
He's gonna put the old video up OMEGALUL
Jerma, I'm so sorry that you've been such a bad influence on me and your children
i got a gift sub to this stream
You can use the portal to the underworld
if you dont take it you're a fake gamer
if you get a bad end, you lose the game
do you even know what a vase is
I'm sorry but I can't get into this game anymore
I'm sorry but I can't get into this game anymore
do you want me to have a look at this guy's ass
if you want to play, you can play it on your own, it's like this
I am so confused, why is the music playing
you can do the same thing to a whole village
Make a hotdog stand in the middle of the street
put the stream on your car radio
jerma is just a boomer who has never played a video game
You can also buy a lot of subbies, if you want.
do you know why you're so popular?
You can do it, but only if you pay taxes
I can't believe that's been a full month
I think I'm just a fucking big brain
can you please just do the whole thing again
You can also buy subbies, if you want.
jermaWalk Clap Now That's What I Call a Jerma Walk
you can use the portal to the underworld

Hey, how about that bottle of wine you're drinking today?
This is what happens when you eat too much tuna
The first 30 mins are just a blur
I'm going to watch the VOD and see what I missed
I think you can do it. :)
can you show the rat movie from the movie?
this is a very long tutorial LUL
what if you hit the wall and arent wearing clothes
I am only here to witness the true end of the JermaCrafting saga jermaVenus
get the good ending, the bad ending is too painful
I just got here, what's going on
How are you supposed to know what an upside down symbol is?
you can do it with the boots
Is that a reference to the game Resident Evil 2?
this game is too good for jerma to play it
there are so many you should just not play it
you have to have a package
If you were to make a movie that would be it
If you don't get a refund I'm going to scream
im glad to hear youre doing well, have a good night and stay safe
you need to take the bonus from the first level to unlock the other characters
is this the streamer that made a mistake on stream?
this is a really bad strategy for that
i dont know what hes talking about but its a really good song
I can't believe jerma is dead, chat has been in coma for 30 years
imagine if he was like "can i have some of your money"
I hope you have a good time with Kim
I'm here because I love you. I'm here for the funny
you're going to have to make a new account for that
what if we kissed in the labo stream
imagine not being able to see jerma at work
YOU WERE GOING TO THE MAZE BUT IT WAS A PLUMBER
I thought you were gonna say that for the rest of the stream
That's how you get a 7/10
the sound design in this game is fantastic
what if we kissed in the labo stream
That's why you don't use the chainsaw
I can't believe you can't be a professional baseball player
it's a really good game, i'll give it a try if you play it
i can't believe you're still doing this
i love how you said you'd play ace attorney on the 21st

i hope he plays monster hunter again
you can get the boots by picking up the right stick
you can get the boots by throwing dynamite at them
you can use the axe to kill the ladders
you can use the boots to kill the ladders
It's a little bit hard to read
You're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOOB MAN!
What if you play the other game
you can't just say "oh hey" and not show up
Please play the game that came out like 10 years ago
You can just turn it off and go to sleep
this is a classic, all the cool kids are gone
if you're not gonna play this game, why not?
the voice acting in this game is so bad
jermaSour when you drink the water and get a cold
I wanna see what you have to do
I can't believe he's still playing this game
There are multiple endings, you just have to beat it
is this the new super mario sunshine?
its like playing a game with a controller and its just a big circle
you can only get the boots by throwing dynamite at them
you can use the axe to kill the ladders
The boots are for the secret room
this is a fucking mess, I can't believe you're still playing this game
I don't like the sound of this game

====================
I'm watching a guy with a keyboard play this game on the phone
this is like one of those games where you just play the game, and then you play a different game
I can't believe you got the VITAMINS from the GRILLERS
Jerma is like a zoomer, he cant play anything
you can click on the chat to see a list of things you have done
is that the one with the burger king ass
jermaSun i want to play this game again

he's gonna be playing diablo 2 again jermaPluto

This is just a different version of the same mission
this is just the tutorial to get a better weapon
i have to see that one again LUL
just got here, what is this game about?
the game is called jump king and it's like 2 hours long
you can make a bunch of people homeless to make money
would you say that if I were you, or if I was you?
You can't put a whole pizza on the grill
I hate the way you keep saying "SOMEBODY"
i want to play this game now and be disappointed jermaPluto
can you play the music so we can listen to it
imagine being a chef and seeing this man eat a bagel with a fork
I hope we get a spill joke for that
I just got here and I'm already upset
please play the new minecraft update, it's coming out soon
i think you should put the other one on
Hey Jerma, what's your favorite color to match with your personality?
you have to make the other characters have the same hair
i want to see you play more of this game
theres a lot of secrets in this game
I like the way you're holding your phone
it's like a middle school playground game LUL
that is the most american thing you can say
you can't just say "Oh yeah" and put it out
You're gonna die and be replaced with a fucking clown
is there a way to do the same thing
You know, this game is pretty cool
Jerma985 would you ever play one of the sims games?
i can't believe you've been playing this game for 12 hours
Can we get a new Jerma in the chat?
i feel like im in a fever dream
You have to save the world and use it for a few years
The same reason people play games in the nude
you can change the font in the settings
are you going to play the new Animal Crossing
You can't keep saying "Oh god" it's a meme
hey jerma can you please make a song
this is the most stressful thing youve ever done
jerma your going to lose all your viewers
I've never seen someone so bad at a game
When are you going to play the new Animal Crossing?
do you have the wii u games collection?
I'm glad you're playing this game, Jerma
I hate that there's no way he's not actually paying attention to this game
you could put the other 2 in there
I'm so glad you're playing this game!
You're supposed to save it in the safe place, not the safe place
if you could actually kill a human right now
please look at this image for an hour

Jerma is the ultimate boomer who can't even win a game

====================
the game awards are gonna be a big shitshow
he's gonna beat it on stream, the game awards are gonna be big shitshow
why did the game music make him laugh so much?
what if jerma is a weeb and he's playing this game on stream?
he did that with the one shotting thing
he had to break a vase to get the key
i thought this was gonna be the funny stream
this is like the 3rd time i've seen this game

why is it always a mirror in the house
i wish i could watch this live, it makes me feel good
Jerma, do you think the next video for this series is gonna be called "The Bionicle"?
jerma you can't make a coaster that has no name
you can walk on the ground from the main lobby
i thought it was a gta but it was actually a stream
is it still the same? Youre streaming it at the same time
this is like a nightmare scenario for jerma
This is the most compact game I have ever seen
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
can you pause the stream i need to go to bed
This is the hardest thing in the world
I'm so tired of this fucking game LUL
Jerma do you know what a jup is?
Jerma you can stop playing and play the game
theres a jup in the chat, it's jup :)
I think he got the wrong game for the wrong reason
have you played this game before? I've heard it was harder than the original
why would they be trying to kill you
Just because you're not a psycho doesn't mean you aren't a cool person
I'm still waiting for a special guest to get on stage.
Jerma is getting so bored of his own stream
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not even gonna watch the stream
I feel like this stream is like a fever dream
make sure you have the world record in that game
you look like a little girl at this point
You can just go to the dungeon and get it
i'm going to eat a whole sleeve of oreos
it's because you didn't wear the mask
are you sure you don't have a bald spot?
jermaWalk ANY DREW CREW IN CHAT jermaWalk

can we go back to the beginning
I can't wait for Jerma to stream all of these

If you want to make a new viewer, just watch this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk4q_7JbVpc
i'm going to get an ad for the stream now

Jerma is gonna be the next hot topic on this year's agenda
Just do it, you can do it
there is a high chance of you dying
you can also do it on the second floor of the arena
this is like when you go to the dentist and the dentist says "why are you fucking around in the bath"
I am so glad that Jerma has a more active and productive chat. Thanks for the entertainment Jerma <3
i want to be a mod :) jermaSun
You're gonna get shot, you're gonna get eaten

jermaJup1 jermaJup2
====================
'

You can change the setting to custom music
you can move your mouse up and down while in the air
i've been gone for 2 hours, what happened to you?

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4

I'm really excited for this stream! I'm excited for Jerma to be playing a game!
he's already a boomer, how can he not understand what's going on
He's got a literal poo poo poo collection
You could play Dead Space VR, but VR is still the best game
You'll make it through this game without dying
you don't have to hit the switch for it
You're getting old, Jerma. You gotta take a break
you dont have to run away, you can just jump
you're the one who gets things done around here
Jerma i'm so high i can't watch this stream without peeing my pants
you have to bring the body back to the hospital
oh god, oh fuck, I'm gonna fucking die
I don't think you can skip the cutscene
hey jerma, just wanted to let you know that my 3 year old son died this morning.
Jerma it's a picture of you kissing yourself

You have to get the good ending
I can't believe you thought this game was good
how do you do the rat voice?
Jerma, you have to do the Q R S
you're making me want to go to bed
It's all over the place with the music
theres a hole in the wall behind you
you need to do the other quests
You can make your own game, but you can't make your own movies
how did you know what theres was?
get the gun from the other room
have you seen the new Disney movie, "The Good, the BAD, the ugly"?
this is the one with the "kid"
I think it's a game where you are a drug dealer
you have to get the chainsaw from the other room
I had a dream where you just ate a whole ass burger and then you just let it sit out for hours
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE THE DIAGONAL LINK
you can get a free copy of Dragon's Dogma right now
I think you can do a better job at this one
you have to jump when you hit the ground
just watch the end of the stream
you have to get the chainsaw from the other room
have you ever considered doing a cooking stream with your brother?
is there a clip of the last stream?
i thought you were going to play this game for the next 4 hours
You got rid of the first one
You need to get the boots to use the boots
You can do it if you don't have a dick
you can get the chainsaw from the other room
That's the kind of game I'm looking forward to
You can use the chainsaw to make a chainsaw that makes chainsaw ammo
you just need to be able to walk
It's a little over an hour, but that's a lot
if you didn't have a dick, why would you have it
you can put an arrow in front of the main quest to get it
i think i saw a clip of that one

You should try to get the boots, they are really good
he's a cow, he's gonna die at the age of 28

Why would you want to do that when you could just do that?

YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING I DO
What if we get a rat on the nose
I can't believe they made a game like this

You need to get a new monster
jerma you should stream on a more regular schedule
please play more of the super paper mario stream
can you please play the goddamn vr game
theres a chance to drop a bomb in this game
why does he have so many lives ?
I'm pretty sure this is a good game
this is gonna be the most boring stream ever
just a couple of guys walking up to a random dude with a shotgun and they're like "HEY GUYS WHERE ARE MY KIDS?"
jermaDafoe I like to be liked by people who I'm not even trying to be
I cant believe this streamer is STILL playing this
Is this the guy who beat Mallow on stream?
he has a timer on his back jermaPluto
Dude I'm so fucking high right now what's going on
you have to place bricks on the edges of the gravel to make it look good
you should play as the horseman of this game, he's a god of a gamer
chat im so sorry to hear that jermaPluto
This is the best game you've played in a while
is that the song from the mario game
if you're good at something never do it for free

he was just trying to save himself from death
they just need to get a new driver

You can find the rat in the Egg's home
this is like that scene in dracula where dracula goes to the bathroom
jerma can you do the "fuck you" voice
you should try the katana zero ost
can you do the voice of the monkey from resident evil 2?
i have no idea what is happening
i mean it has the same settings as the last one
this game is so good, but so bad it's boring
If you do it in the movie, you're going to get the ending
is it true that you are a fake gamer?
It's so easy to get into the restaurant
you need to get the boots now
I'm so glad you're playing this game, it's been fun
you can sell them to a merchant for 100%
you should put a checkpoint in the middle of the arena
they are just picking up their legos from the arcade
you guys need to go back
====================
I just realized that the game looks like a cooking sim
its funny because you are playing the game in front of a live audience of people
do you remember the best song in the game?
I can't believe Jerma would just be like this
jerma what if you were a small child and you had a little brother
the only reason people keep using it is bc it's a joke
Jerma will you ever play all the nier games?
I'm getting flashbacks of that song from the first movie
You have to get a new keyboard, there's a new one in the back of your truck
he's gonna need the infinity stones to get through all of the bosses
Jerma is a cat, he can't see chat :(
jerma has to get a new chair in the store
they dont need to be a few feet apart, its not a lot
i will eat a shoe if you play this
JERMA FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST DIE
you can tell he's a good person :)
you know what they say about a good streamer
You were on the phone with your dad.
You can just use the cheat engine
You know what they say about a good streamer?
They're like the ones that play in the backseat of a car on a highway
he can't see it because it's already been 20 years
he's gonna stream for like 6 hours
i think the main channel is gonna be in the new year stream
I have no clue what you're talking about
how many channel points for you to beat the game
jerma can you go to the other room
JERMA I KNOW WHAT IT IS I KNOW WHAT IT IS
hey jerma can you please play minecraft on stream :)
you need to be in the museum
You can get your own village on the map
what if we kissed while we were camping
you know what they say about a good streamer
do you want to see the ending of the game?
I love the farts and screams in the background
I'm gonna go get a glass of water, you're welcome
don't worry, I'm just joking, he has a game called Deltron.
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
you just made a million dollars off of this
Jerma I think you can't see it because the game is already on the front page
JERMA'S ADDICTED TO THE OLD WAY OF STREAMING
we're all gonna be so disappointed in a few years
you need to use your special moves
JERMA YOU NEED TO START BUYING WELL PICK THE RIGHT TIME
YOU HAVE TO GET THE MONEY BACK
he said it's gonna be a 6 hour stream
this is a game about killing people
You can get the boots by killing them all
you're on the edge of your seat
so why do you keep saying it's a movie?
you just beat it without any prior knowledge
You're not even that bad at this game
i will give you my brain, it's only a dollar
i'm back did you get the boots
you're playing this game for the first time
you can do it, you just need to be a little more patient
I think you might be able to find the tickets
you're making the wrong choice, you have to play the game for the whole duration
Theres a different kind of turkey
he's gonna keep forgetting he's been streaming for over 5 hours
you can just put it in the vod
theres a new game you can play
is this the streamer that said he hates seagulls on stream?
I'm starting to think this is some sort of cult classic
You can't escape the fact that you're a boomer
you can build a town and explore in the town you built
jermaSun JERMA FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST DIE
Jerma will you be streaming Animal Crossing on the 21st?
YOU NEED TO GET THE MONEY BACK
wouldnt it be funny if you put the door open and it turns green
This is the only game you'll ever play
you need to start with the top right of your screen
you gotta eat the shoe to defeat the boss
@Jerma985
====================
i'm gonna go to bed, goodnight everyone jermaHeart
what are you talking about? i'm gonna take a nap.
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I'M GONNA PLAY BUGS LIFE jermaChomp
Jerma you can just do the "I'm not a boomer" bit and leave
you have to clean all the dirty spots on the floor
i was going to ask what is going on but now i'm wondering
Is this the guy that ate an entire mcdonalds mcdonalds
you can get the bionic boomer with the coin
what if you're playing an old game?
it takes you a full minute to look at them
you can change the number of bits to whatever you want
you have to download the addon for it
that guy is a fucking clown, i hate it
you are now a paid wrestler
You can tell you're doing this by the way the game
you could have just watched the stream LUL
why do you keep going to the sewer again
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 where the FUCK is my JUP jermaJup3 jermaJup4
this is the worst part of the game
Jerma can you please get a glass of milk
jermaOtto "The only thing that is in the mind of man is his mind and body"
They were all bots, they're just people trying to make money
what the fuck is going on in this game
It's so fucking funny to hear you get your ass beat in a game of football
Is this the guy that beat Sekiro on stream?
I just got here, can you do the "what if" joke again?
This game is going to be the entire stream.
you can play this game with keyboard and mouse
You can do it with the guide book
This is the best game ever made
this is like a sequel to the same game
you're gonna end up like the centipedes at the end of the movie
I can't believe Jerma is gonna be late to work on his stream jermaPluto
I'm glad we finally got a clip of the mic and then he just said "I don't care"
oh god he's gonna be so bad at this
if you are good at something never do it for free
You have to use the scroll on the other side
this is a puzzle game it's not a puzzle game
you can use it to find stuff in the game
how does a baby have a big rat
I like how Jerma985 is only playing for one minute LUL
this is like the dark souls of oblivion
you can get a good wii for this
i want to buy a jerma water bottle
you can just ask her to make a new one
"I dont want to go to bed"
I wish they made a VR game like this.
The game awards are still in February
you dont need to move your mouse when you're on the ground
the way the game is said "WHERE"
You know you can just go out to eat at a restaurant and eat an entire lasagna at once, right?
jermaOld Jerma is the first person I've ever seen
hey guys im new here is jerma ok
what the fuck did i just tune into
you can play the game with the guide book and keyboard
if you don't do it you're a fucking child
you are a top streamer, get it right
I would've had to go to bed right now
This is the hardest boss in the game, Jerma
i want to go to bed but i don't want to miss the stream
this is like the half life game from the early 2000s
you got it right, you can do it
You can go to a casino and gamble it all away
You can't get a good PS1 controller for this
you just wanna be the one guy
the other guy is literally the main character
I love that the theme for the game is the theme of my nightmares
you have to get the golden boots
You're gonna get sick of it when you go back to the main menu
Did you know that the ice cube in the background is a robot?
i love how theres a dude in here
theres a secret ending if you beat the game
====================
I am so glad you are playing this game :)
that's the reason you don't have any food
I just got back from dinner, whatâ€™s happening
i like how jerma's chat is filled with normies
If you're good at something never do it for free
I can't believe jerma is still streaming this game
I'm not a mod I'm a pleb
jermaJex jermaJex2 I can't believe you're still streaming
I can't believe he's still streaming this game
just got back and I'm so confused LUL
It's a hard game, but the bosses are fun
why does this game have a 0 on the joke score
you should be able to go to the bathroom and get a glass of milk
I'm gonna say it, Jerma's the best streamer ever, and he's gonna have a blast
The stream is going to be so boring LUL
you have to do it to the whole screen
youre doing a great job and a great job
this is a lot of work for a baby
you're not a real gamer, you're a cow
it was fun but I'm going to watch that vod
you can change the date in the options
jerma can you do a voice command
you're really making it sound like you're not even a real gamer
if you get in the blackhole, it's going to hurt you
I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean with a fishing boat and no fish
why is he playing this game in the middle of the desert
JERMA I WANT TO GET OFF MR WOODS WILD RIDE
this is so fucking good at this point
I just got here what the fuck is happening
If you're good at something never do it for free
how do you even know what you're doing
Is this the streamer who lost to Pinwheel?
play the game and beat it, it's not hard :)
you can make a paperclip store in the yard
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THIS ONE
I can't believe you just admitted to eating ass
you got some good vibes dude, just not as good as the other two
This is the most genuine Jerma is having
hey can you explain the fuckface movie please?
i'm sorry jerma i have to leave now
you can make a paperclip store in the yard
It's because you got trapped in the middle of the water
jerma you need to stop streaming it's time to relax
I like how Jerma985 is still playing this game
it's a really good game, but it's not a good stream game
can you explain the fuckface movie please
Just wait for the wind to kill you
You can get a free copy of the game with that one
can you please say pee pee poo poo
i think you have to find the disc
I can't believe Jerma thinks this is real
That is the voice actor for the character
it's like a cave with a bunch of skeletons
i feel like im in a fever dream
you can make a paperclip store in the yard
you can make a paperclip store in the yard
are you gonna play this game for the entirety of the next week?
theres a lot of stuff on youtube that you can do
I just want to know why Jerma doesn't play the Simpsons Game
theres a secret in the closet that you can use to unlock the secret door
he's gonna get a lotta people killed
you can make a paperclip store in the yard
i'm not paying attention to this game, what is going on
you guys are just pretending to be bad
i would get so many e3 presentations this year
what do you think of the new Blizzard character?
why do you keep talking about getting rid of all the wink emotes
if i were to donate $10 would you pay it back?
I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean with a fishing boat and no fish.
jerma you need to stop playing this game
what the fuck does this even mean
Jerma just call the stream and tell us to be quiet
You can't just sell your soul to them
====================
it's like a small phone, you can call it
You should put it on a table and then let it sit for 20 minutes
What are you doing today with your schedule?
You can hear the anger in his voice
that's what you get for not getting the boots
We are just watching the stream in the bathroom
You can get a lot of good items for a lot of money
you can turn off the radio for a while
I'm so glad I was able to catch one of these streams
You're not gonna get past the first level, you're gonna get to the last level first
It's been a long time since I've been here
jerma, if you don't do this tomorrow I'm gonna tell my mom
it's because you didn't get the boots
This is the most casual thing I've ever seen
Do you have any plans for the Halloween stream?
you need to remember you can always tell when a stream is happening
you have to do the right thing and cancel it
Jerma please play this game with a controller it's so good
I'm so glad you're playing this game, I'm so glad you're playing it
this is the first stream i've ever watched
oh yeah, I played it a few days ago
if you can do that you can do that
he cant make a good game that's not a good game
You have to eat a shoe, it's a lie
I would not be surprised if the devs made this game
its not the same guy who just said it
he didnt say that he doesnt know that
theres a secret boss if you do that
This is the best part of the game
Jerma you've been playing this game for a while, you know that?
How much is this game for? How much is this for Jerma?
jermaWalk BREEDER BRIGADE WE ARE THE SHIT jermaWalk
i can't believe jerma is doing a livestream of his colonoscopy
is it true you're a furry now?
It's ok to have a bad time Jerma
i hope you know you're not a boomer
theres a new one coming out soon
They can't keep you from throwing stuff at them
They could just do a ton of roads and shit
you can get the boots for $10 :)
just make it a "imagine being bad at a game" stream
I thought it was supposed to be the doom ost
jermaOld I've got a big car to drive jermaOld
theres a secret boss if you do that
how much does a bug have to eat?
I have no idea what this game is about
if you can do it in under 5 seconds it will be a huge achievement
I hate you Jerma but I love you <3
I have never seen a person so angry in their life
jerma its only 3 hours, why is it still going?
how does it feel to be the top clown in the land?
you can use it to craft things out of scratch
You're gonna die in the first 3 minutes
you need to put down a key
it's not a bug, it's just that your controller isn't working
jerma your eyes are so fucking blurry right now
you can get a lot of good items for a lot of money
why do people have so much shit in their drink
this is the only reason you'll ever be a successful streamer
I'm glad I could catch one of these streams
I've been watching you for like 2 hours and I can already tell you're fucking terrible at games.
you have to take the world record in this game
You are doing a great job! A GREAT JOOOB
i just got here, is this the game with the random deaths?
is this the streamer that played a shitty game on stream
what are you going to do with all these timeouts?
If you don't give us a free pass, you're a fucking asshole
you're actually the best streamer on twitch
jerma you just said you'll never play a video game
Jerma you should of just played with that and learned how to play the game
jermaOld I'm not gonna let this game distract me from the fact
====================
YouTubers that never stop streaming, you're so funny
What about a stream where you are in the closet?
theres a secret ending if you don't pay the lady

I was hoping you'd play Bloodborne but it's not on Steam right now
I'm a bit disappointed you didn't play the new half life on stream jermaPluto
you need to find a way to make it work
i think theres a spell to make you kill people
i'm gonna go watch the vod, i don't want to miss anything
I'm back. I'm watching the VOD and I'm not disappointed
you're not even close to the top of the tower

i think i saw a star in the distance
what's your favorite sour candy? mine is lime
Hes doing a comedy tier list, I'm excited for that
Why does he look like he has a full head of hair
You're gonna make it to the first level
That's why we have to go to the bathroom
it's the first game in the series, and it's a lot of fun
i love how you can just sit on the toilet and hold a button down to do this
did you know that the nuke is going to kill the entire human race
Hey buddy, you're doing a great job
i'm sorry you have to deal with this, i know you'll be able to handle it, but this is my first time here and i'm very disappointed
I remember this game, it was so bad LUL
you said you were going to play it a few days ago
just let it be known that jerma is the best streamer ever :)
i cant believe the red skull is in this game
Jerma you have to get all the medals
Can we get some jermaGrin for the hype train?
you have to do the voice again
stop using the magnifying glass and look at the screen
you should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
its like a mall in a different timezone
i love how it makes you feel like an adult
this is the worst game ive ever seen
it's a game about a computer, it's not about the games
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY "no" AND MAKE IT AN ANSWER
Is this the guy who got addicted to Monster Energy?
That's why you don't drink water. Drink it from the tap
you know what they say about a man with short legs
it was a good game for a good stream
you could always do it without that one
I swear this game is my favorite game
you should just go back to where you started and do a game again
I heard you can sell your soul to the devil
I think there's a secret ending if you don't pay the lady
there are more than 5 notes in the game
I just got back from the dentist, how many times has he been stuck on this level?
he has to be in the next rumble
you're gonna be here for an hour jerma

I just got here, what the fuck is happening

i'm going to go get food, you better make it this time
you gotta use the brown noise
Please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
This game is so much more fun than I expected
What if you need to change the oven?
is it just me or does your voice sound higher pitched?
The game is so hard you're gonna have to learn how to play it
why do you have so many enemies LUL
If you want to know what game this is, just look up the ending
if you're good at something never do
====================
 Jerma985 is doing a bit where he has a full mouth cam
i thought that was a phone call from jerma
i wanna see jerma play animal crossing :)
remember when you were gonna do a cooking stream?
"Why would you let me play a game I hate"
i thought you were gonna play the game
he's going to die of an aneurysm
you need to get the other ones
You're a boomer, you don't know what a plumber is
hey guys i got a phone call from jerma and hes telling me that he got the game
how does one man be so good at videogames
he's a scammer he can't even beat the final boss
i feel bad for this streamer now jermaPluto
I was here for the carnival stream, so I am jermaVenus
it's just the same engine that was used for the PS2
"I'm gonna take this one out of the bag"
jermaWalk Me walking to the bar and buying a beer
didnt you have to finish this game on stream?
it was just a joke, why is he not playing the game
how do you even do the math on this?
LUL this is a prerecorded stream he was just at the end of the stream
YOU HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 30 YEARS OLD
the game is called "Duck Game" and you can beat this game with your bare hands
you should play the sequel, it's called "Slots"
You need to be at least 30 to beat this game
why are you so nervous about talking about your height?
Are you gonna play KENSHI on stream?
you could say you're the best streamer on this channel
PLEASE LISTEN TO THE SONG BY ED EDD AND EDDY
I just got here. How's the stream going?
they're just trying to get rid of the meme
The only way to get rid of the meme is to just do it yourself.
so when is the next horror game coming out?
he didn't know what he was in for
if you're in a coma, can you sing for us?
can you explain the bingo card please?
He's gonna get so mad at this game he won't even remember the first one
you need to go back and get the boots
I'm gonna head out, good night everyone jermaHeart
you know what they say about a good game
you can play as a cat in this game
what if you got a quarter eaten?
you have to get the item from the merchant
he can't even do the final mission OMEGALUL
I've been watching you since you were like 4 years old
How many times have you said you're gonna do the new Animal Crossing game?
You should check the new Animal Crossing if you think the game is bad
i would have been so mad at this game
What if you have a better chance to win?
You can build a building that's worth building
you can hit A with the staff
you can make your own characters by making a custom character creator
this is the most unplayable game of all time
are you gonna do more cooking stream?
If youâ€™re gonna be here for a while, be sure to give us a chance!
this is just a way to distract you from the game
you can shoot him with the staff
jerma what the fuck do you mean by a scooby doo
I'm starting to think that you're a serial killer
You should do a "Is This the Streamer Who Mangled by a Wire?"
please try the new Animal Crossing song :)
you can do a second jump later
i want a green screen stream, let me show you my profile picture :)
It's the same engine as that one game
you can do it now :) I think
this is the most depressing game I've ever seen
he is just sitting on his toilet jermaDisgust
I really hope you're ready for the next boss
i wish i had a sub to give to my friends
We need to tell you that
@Jerma
====================
Can't believe jerma is actually playing that game
jerma theres a man who will make your life better
I just got here why is he playing a scary game
what are you talking about this game is great
the game lets you make your own private messages
do you have the latest version of windows
YOU NEED TO SHOOT THE GUN TO SAVE THE GAME
this game is so cool and so good
It's a lot better than you I think
you're gonna be in this one for a while
I'm like a jermaOneguy trying to get a friend
you're not allowed to get a gift sub
how many times have you been a sub?
I just got back, what is this stream
I'm gonna go watch the VOD now, thanks for the entertainment Jerma
This is like the worst thing you could do
That was a bad decision, it makes no sense
how many of you guys have been here to watch you play this game
i'm not even sure you can do that
The game was fun, but the story was ResidentSleeper
You can use your boots to make it so you don't get knocked down
jermaWalk I want to go to bed jermaWalk
there's no way he can keep this up
did you know that there are over 1000,000,000 games?
how do you know what your going to do
You can change the time in the menu
YOU NEED TO TAKE THE CREDIT CARD
can you turn off the music please? i cant hear it
you have to do the red sox
they're really good at keeping the ball out of your hands
you are in a coma and the only thing you can hear is your own voice
JERMA, THE GAME WAS TOO GOOD FOR YOU
you know you have to get the ending
they're gonna be like "you're playing a game"
I'm really excited for the carnival stream, I can't wait to see Jerma playing with his friends and see what happens
I've never seen a game this good before
he said he would do it once before
I'm so excited for the carnival stream, so excited for the carnival
You have to get all 3 keys first
hey i think you got the wrong door
you know what they say about big ass bones
this is a fucking OLD MOMENT LUL LUL
jerma's not gonna stream for another 4 days
you can just make the sound you want it to be
there is no way he's gonna do it
you can make it so that it becomes infinite
this is just a bad dreamcast game LUL
he has a dong for every new viewer
you can make the music as much as you want
JERMA IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT YOU NEVER PLAYED GAMES
you can make the music as much as you want it to be
this is like that episode of season 3 where they go to hell and end up in the grave
I mean, you can get all the weapons, but not the gun?
can you turn the sound down, my volume is too low
he's gonna get so mad at this game
He's just doing a stand up comedy routine
i wish i could just walk around in this car with a guy driving around in it
you're supposed to press the buttons first
you gotta bring your own food. It's not the same thing
I'm sorry jerma, I can't get you to play more animal crossing
jerma is going to die in the end
this is why you're the best at video games
you have to make a hand for each claw machine
I have to go to bed now, please finish this @Jerma985
i was gone for like 30 minutes and he's still here
you have to get the ending first
You should play Team Fortress 2, it's got a lot of new maps
you can get more than one gift sub from this stream
theres a mod that fixes it, please do it
you can make it infinite by using a cheat engine
you can make the sound you want it to be infinite
you have to get all the weapons first
I'm a pleb but I'm a pleb too
Hey @
====================
 BACK ON THE FRICKS
you should try and play more Nancy Drew
do you have a clip of that?
I remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT ALL AT ONCE
"I'm just gonna play this game for a couple of hours"
You guys are like a bunch of losers who have never heard of this game before
please beat the game i want to go to bed
He said he will play DMC2 one day
Jerma, what's with the "he's not streaming today" meme
theres a lot of blood in there
jerma, you can put the door in the fire
Jerma is a very handsome boy. :)
you can turn off the face cam now
you need to get more heroes to fight the other side
that's the only way you can get there
You don't even know how to play this game
Jerma the GBA had a full letter grade system for games
it's not a stunt, it's a trick Kappa
you know you can just play it for a few hours
You can't let them get to you
theres a way to do that on a phone
imagine not knowing what a pentagram is OMEGALUL
You are a fire hydrant, you can't even get to the water
do you have a pool of water?
i love you but your character is just a cute little girl
HE'S GONNA GET KICKED BY THE COW jermaVenus
I heard that theres a sex scene in this game
I swear if you don't talk about otto I'm going to have to go to bed
if you die in the game you die in real life
When you are doing a tutorial, press the left trigger to aim
When will you play the "I'm a filthy filthy animal" game?
it's like when you're trying to do a puzzle with a controller
Just got here, is this game boring? I want to watch Jerma play it but I don't want to watch the vod
You should play the original Dead Space, it's like this.
there's a lot of good games on there
I got my wisdom teeth removed, what do I do
i'm gonna go watch your old vids jerma
I think you have to talk to the chef
I'M SORRY JERMA I JUST WANTED TO SEE THE VOD
how does the floor have a different color?
You can do this by clicking on the settings
It's okay to be a little quiet. :)
I think it's because the planet has a huge gas leak
I have no clue what's going on.
HEY GUYS! STOCK MARKETING IN THE NEAREST PART OF THE WORLD, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA PLAY
you need to buy more heroes to fight the other side
its been 10 years since you last streamed
you should play this game again, it's amazing
please play ace attorney its free on steam
just make it like the old guy
can you make a new sub sound?
jermaJex is the only one I've ever seen that isnt a redditor
This is the best game you've played all year
Just wait until he gets to the top rope
you are a little too close to the mic
are you going to play The Adventures of Tron Bonne?
jerma is gonna eat his own ass :(
i'm so glad you're not playing this game
can you do the "I'm a dirty little slut" voice
jerma is the only person in the world who doesn't like the game
You're so bad at this game, that I don't even know how to play it
He's gonna get a bong stuck in his ear
if you dont go live right now im unsubbing
if you dont get to the top rope im unsubbing
just wait for the ball to touch the ground
you need to pay your taxes first
play the whole game on stream please
If you ever do a face reveal, make sure to wear a wig
it's the only
====================
I can't believe he's still playing this LUL
that's the fucking nose on the back of your head
this is what happens when you dont clean
You should play the original Dead Space on stream, it's good
I got a bad feeling about this one
the only reason you can get it is because you got it in the middle of the last stream
just make it a mod and show us your art
I'm a huge fan of the POG myself
jermaWalk NANCY DREW IS GOING TO BE SO EPIC jermaWalk
Jerma is going to play DR2 but not the first game
have you ever played the latest darksouls?
just make the entire house a fake house
I bet you're a little anxious when you get knocked out.
this is why you dont have a dad
this is how you make a movie in real life
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
is this the streamer that made an E3 demo on stream?
I'm just here for the live chat, not the streams
please play that one game from your childhood
I'll give you $1,000 to beat this game
jerma I know you are a fan of this game but what if you were a clone of yourself?
you can put a bullet in the bullet and shoot it
The cat is in the top bunk jerma
You're not allowed to have a bad joke
I was never able to do it because of this
if you do it again ill donate $50
Please do a funny voice at the end
just keep going back and forth for a few hours
jerma is the only thing keeping me sane
it takes a lot to make a lot of money
you can do it with the ps4 controller
you have to have a lot of room
theres a way to get more stuff from the shop
this game is just a ripoff of skate 3
I just got here why is there a hole in the wall
you have to get out of the way first
you can use the bench to get up there
you need to learn how to read
Jerma is gonna do a stream where he looks like the protagonist of a children's book
you need to get more stuff from the shop
He's going to beat the game first try, you have to beat it first try
the last one is the best one jerma
I mean, he was a gamer, he could've played Hearthstone and made it to level 100, but he didn't
you can have more than one way to do a mission, and also it will be faster if you have to go back and forth between the missions
i have to do all the work jermaPluto
he just wants to be a normal human
"I'm not gonna leave" - jerma to the other kids
what if you're still playing this and you're playing this on your own
i think you're doing a great job :)
jermaOneguy is a mod of jermaOneguy and he's here to help
you can do that with the ps4 controller
You can use it to get to the next area in the game
Jerma is just trying to find a way to be in a room with only 3 people
I bet you can't even beat the first level
i'm gonna go eat dinner and get back to you
this is just the shitty story from the last game
you can make a full deck of cards from the game
you're like a really big guy in the house
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I want to go to the bathroom right now
do you have a 20$ clip of you saying that
I'm surprised this game doesn't have the fear of a zombie mod
The last thing I saw before I was stabbed
is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel?
you can use it to get to the next area in the game
don't forget to get a new set of clothes
can you say a swear so I can post links?

@Jer
====================
This is like the simpsons hit and run stream
you can switch it to 1st person if you want
it's the actual movie from the movie night
JERMA YOU JUST BOUGHT AN ENTIRE EARPHONE ON STAGE
if you were a cat, you would be the cat
they're trying to get you to move
how do i check if my account is live
when did the stream start? i was gone for a bit
you need to use the cheat engine
you could play this game for like a week
can you just make the whole game of the game
it's like the part where you get the shirt
they're making the family guy house in the new house
You need to get the boots to beat the game
this is the equivalent of a snail eating a shoe
can you make the dog like it's food
you have to pay the loan, it's like a million dollars
I'm so glad you're playing this game :)
Hey Jerma, can you tell me the story of when you shit your pants?
You need to change your name to Jerma
Jerma what's the name of the character from the show "The Mask"?
Is this the streamer who lost to PINWHEEL
Please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
what if you are a bad guy monkaS
i would do it if i was a mod
The fact that you can't change it is the real plot of the game
Jerma you're making me so mad. I'm going to smash my head against a wall.
I can't believe Jerma's dying to Pinwheel LUL
you are in a coma, please wake up jermaPluto
you can get the boots by jumping off the cliff
Theres a secret boss in this game
he's just a guy on the beach
you are not going to beat this game, you are not going to beat this game.
theres a secret boss in this game
it's a very different game. you can't see it
"Why are you here? I'm going to leave"
what if you actually bought a cool bracelet
you dont need the boots you can just get the boots from a shop
HE'S LYING HE'S GONNA HURRY UP AND STREAM IT
the only way to beat this is to go to the sewer
can you play that shitty minecraft game again
you're making me so mad. im going to smash my head against a wall.
This is the most frustrating thing I've ever heard
There's a secret boss in this game
I have to go to work in 2 minutes
how long has he been on this level?
That was a really good joke, Jerma, you're very funny and very entertaining
I made a new account just to mess around.
it's the same thing with the mouse
when you go to the top, press R to go to the bottom
did you see the trailer for the game?
If you do that again I will eat my own ass
please finish this or i will unsub
you should do a cooking stream where you just serve food and it's just you cooking it
is that the best you can do at the game?
that's the first time i've ever heard that
you have to do the tutorial again
you have to give him the boots to beat the game
You can also find the part in the town where the ghost girl is
theres a secret boss in this game
He's going to do that in the next room
oh my god, i just noticed this game, i hate this game

this is a fucking psychopath you're murdering these people
You can use the boots to get the boots
you're making me lose my mind

I'm a huge fan of the old guy in the bottom right
I have a bad feeling about this.

please turn off the face cam its distracting me
hey jerma can i get a pic of your feet
you know it's not a bad idea to have the game in your area
is there anything else you could do?
That's not the same as that video
you can do it, you just need to see the data
i want to see the show otto
this is like a mmo game right now
Jerma is a pretty good actor :)
jerma should play all 3 games at once
I'm so glad we got this game last year
theres a way to make your own road
i'm not sure what's going on but this is great
I miss the old jerma who used to do that
why are you wearing a diaper on stream?
i hope you have a good night :)
you need to be a chad to beat the game
I'm going to call the cops on you
Do you know how to play Death Stranding?
the new font is too small for this stream
is that what the webcam is supposed to be
you just said you are bad at this game
You know, you can be anything you want to be, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun
You need to find the secret room first
you should have just read the bottom left
we will all be dead when you get back
I'm just going to wait for the next stream.
The new song is called "Bare Hand"
You have to do it again next time
You should play this game again, this is the best game ever made
You guys are all leaving, we need to talk to Jerma
if you dont eat the ghost pepper you will be in hell
This is the part where he dies of old age
This game is a bad idea, play the game instead
he has to go to the doctor jermaPluto
It's not really a game, it's a joke
you gotta find the secret room first
will you ever do a live rumble?
have you ever considered playing with the hulk?
can you imagine if Jerma just ate the entire food chain and then just gave it away and never ate again
I've been gone for 2 hours and he's still here?
jerma please do a better roleplay, like the character creator
Hey guys, sorry I'm late to the stream. Can I get a quick rundown of what's going on?
make sure to check the trees and shit, it's kinda important for them to get food
why is the game music going all the way up
it's the face of a guy you killed in the first 30 seconds
just play the game you can't stop playing
hey jerma, i'm gonna take a nap and then come back and you're still here
how is that the most expensive thing in the world
YOU WERE LITERALLY JUST A JERMA SENTENCE IRL
How many people do you have to kill to get a prime subscription to the channel?
i remember when jerma did a stream where he was playing with his friends
that was a mistake, the way you said it wasnt real
jermaSour when you're on the toilet shitting in the shower
why does this sound like it's from a mobile game
You have to play a level after this
it's not a lot, but you can get pretty cheap with a few months worth of upgrades
You have to buy a whole house to build it
I think you can get a good idea of how much you're making with that money
jermaWalk I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE WR
====================
, we need to get that out of the way
it's the same exact song from the simpsons hit and run stream

you are the only person who can do this
I love it, I would be so proud
jermaOld the thing is just a sledgehammer and a gun
i don't know if I like this game
I think you need to do the "look at me" thing

why is there a penis on the top right of the screen
you can just hit the blue button on your controller

There's a mod that adds a graphic of a snake to your stream
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT LIPSTICK YOU ARE TRYING TO TELL THEM
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
I can't believe you're gonna be late
it's the same noise as the teacher's voice
Do you think you're going to play this game for another couple hours?
this is what you get for buying a clown car
You guys are all so mean to Jerma :(
you have to play the song again
I think the voices in the back are just his voice
i'm back, why is your character a cat

just joined, what is the worst noise of 2019
There's a mod that adds a text to speech function for stream chatters

The game is worth it if you're into that kind of thing
theres a mod that adds the rat emote
Why did they let you use the gun
I'll give you 100 dollars if you do it

oh my god you got a couple of bad games in there

no one will know you ate a whole sleeve of oreos on stream
Theres a bug in the game, try refreshing
It's the same as the last game
Just dont play the game, you can't stop playing
Why did you turn into a green giant in the first place?
You have to go to the lower area
how many channel points do you have to donate to start the stream
just in time for the end of the stream
HOLY SHIT JERMA IS STILL IN THE PAST
I hope he gets to the end of the stream
imagine going to a restaurant and they make a sandwich for you
"What are you doing? You're not a real doctor. You're a fake doctor!"

how long has he been playing this? jermaPluto
this game is like a form of a cult
This is just the same game but worse voice acting
so you don't have to buy a house to live in Vegas?
the guy on the left looks like a cat
It's not a copypasta, you can't say it's yours.
I didn't know this game was so complicated
jerma is a lazy boy who knows nothing
you need to use the catapult on the second floor
you can make your own character in this game
this is the last one, i think you can do it
Have you ever tried getting into a casino
You gotta do the bonus levels in order to unlock all the DLC
this game is way better than the last game
This is what happens when you play Fortnite
This game is gonna be so good LUL
I don't want to be a boomer now
what do you think of the new console?
You can use the catapult on the second floor
you have to put the catapult into the building
How does jerma not know the lyrics to the song
jermaWalk I'm not going to sit here and wait for this stream
are you sure you don't need to use the magnet to get the coin?
I'm not going to lie I'm kind of scared
I want to see you get that coin
The only thing I can think of is how to get back to the sewer
I'm just a catboy, i'm happy to help you!
you can use the catapult on the second floor

guys my friend and i have to go to the store, can you please do the jup again
I hate the game, I want to watch the stream
you got a lot of money for this
I think it's time for a jup storm
The only thing I remember is that I'm in a place with a population of about 4,000 people and theres a pool of 6,000 people.
imagine not being able to wink with a twitch prime sub OMEGALUL
What is your opinion on the current state of the AMD market?
that's like saying you can't give me a kiss
imagine if you could have just said "well, you don't need to see me"
you can change your own fuel to prevent crashes
this is like a boss battle between two characters
I cant believe jerma is fucking dead
put your face on the image and you will see it
you can use the gamecube to emulate the game
You can use your mouse and keyboard to select the button to type :)
How many channel points for you to make a new malding noise?
you can also get a saddle for a long time
play the DLC at some point, you're in the early game
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
LUL I'm so glad Jerma is playing this
How much of the money you made was from the carnival?
You have to make the fart sound again
This is the worst stream of the year
that's a really cool thing to happen
Can you give us a good thumbnail of the video you are editing?
it's a lot of work to make sure the kids are ready for college
you can get a pikachu costume from the hulk
you should do a strawpoll to see if people want it or not
this is just a fake game from the early 2000s
I think you need to stop smoking
It's a little hard to tell which is which
you can use the same thing to make a new character
dont forget to turn on your webcam so we can see your ass cheeks
it's literally the same thing as the first one
i love how the game is literally just a loading screen
you dont even need to say anything LUL
LUL I've been here for like 4 hours
I will not stand for this
what the fuck is going on in here
this is the worst game youve ever played
you can change your own fuel to prevent crashes
I dont know what I want to do with my life now
I just got back, why is he still doing this?
I'm still here, waiting for the stream to start
he didnt even get the gun that was in the bottom right
I have to go to bed, can you stop pretending?
he is going to get the boots jermaPluto
are you planning on playing more Animal Crossing?

do you know what a pinatas is?
I'm just gonna watch the VOD for the first time

Hey Jerma, do you think theres a way to get back into the ship?
i cant wait for the stream to start :)
You can get the boots on the first floor
you can use your mouse and keyboard to select the button to type :)
you have to do it in front of the truck
this game is so much better than the first game
you can sell them for more than a dollar
there is a secret ending to this game
you should be able to take a picture of it
Please turn off the music its distracting
you can use your mouse and keyboard to select the button to type :)
I have never seen a game so fun and interactive, I am so excited for
====================
this guy is a fucking psycho he has an insane voice
oh my god this is a really good game
oh god i have to go to sleep
you can use the radio to talk to her
That's what you get for not taking the toll on the highway
you are just a crazed gunman and a killer
the 5g tower was designed to give you the strongest possible resistance
this game was made by a boomer jermaOld
this game has so much stuff in it
You are a fucking idiot, you know that right
we just have a bunch of garbage in the room, theres no way it works
is this the streamer that ate his friend on stream?
theres a whole new generation of streamers, theres no reason to keep them all
it's not going to be an hour LUL
you should play the newest sonic game, its called Sonic Adventure 2
He's gonna make a big mess in the next room
jerma you have to get a haircut now
just use the restroom or something, we want to be safe
he's never gonna get this far LUL LUL
the only way to win is not to play
I have to go to sleep at 3:30
You know what jerma, this is a real shame
this is a very very important message
i hope they have made the music more soothing
i can't wait for the next stream :)
what the fuck is the point of this game if you can't see it
That's not what a dog looks like
HE'S BEEN STREAMING FOR A WEEK, WHAT THE FUCK
how do you know if theres a spider in your house?
I'm waiting for my BILL to be called
you can just jump off the bridge
i think you're supposed to do it first
You need to learn how to train your army
There was a guy that said "I'll take down the server" and then started playing a new game
this is the most epic gamer moment of the year
Jerma is a psycho because he doesn't like to interact with chat
you can upgrade your weapon in the main menu
you know they all say the same thing
how are you still playing this game?
Have you ever been to a zoo in your life?
Jerma, i have a feeling this isn't going to be a good stream
I'm not sure if it's a new game, but if you don't mind?
you can charge up a special attack
Why are you so scared of the red thing?
You can sell the broken items in the shop
You can drop items on the ground.
you can do that with the sword
he's not gonna be streaming for a while
we are all watching jerma on the toilet right now
you're not supposed to do it with the halo mic
it is a super long bit, if you dont finish it im unsubbing
i'm pretty sure that's why he said it
if you get 100 jumps you can use the boots to get a super jump
he's gonna do the "go back to the beginning" bit again
Is this the guy who died to pinwheel on stream?
you have to beat the game to use the item
The final boss is just as bad as the first boss
Why does this guy look like a serial killer
you're making this a lot more complicated
Have you heard of the new Star Wars game?
I'm not sure if you're correct but this is actually a good movie
this is the hardest boss in the game
oh my god this game is so easy
the fucking headless thing is the best boss in the game
You're gonna have to do a lot of work on this one
you have to get the boots before you can use them
I've been here for 5 minutes, what is this game?
you can buy the broken items in the shop
the only thing that's stopping him is that the server is too slow
do you have a katana, a sword, or a shotgun?
This is the best song in the game
JERMA THE CHAT IS PRETENDING TO BE BAD
how many bits are you paying for this
This is why you dont stream in the mornings
you
====================
I have been trying to do this for 5 hours
its a good thing you didn't leave your house
you know what, you should play the new star wars game
the more you use the more you die
did you hear that the new smash character is named "Mister Mosquito"
just remember that you're the only streamer that can read chat, you can't just stop talking
I dont want to go to bed, just to watch the stream
why is the voice actor in this game so fucking good
I hope jerma plays this again because this game is so good
you can do it you can do it
Is that what you do when you're late?
It's a good thing you didn't leave your house
Just take the game to bed, it's fine
It's okay Jerma, you're the only one who's had to deal with that
you could do a twitch playthrough of this game
you can make a dirt dick in this
you said "I'm not gonna do it"
the sun will shine down on jerma's head
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
play the actual game you will have more money
It's a well known fact that your mic can hear you say that
i'm not gonna lie you look like a complete psycho
the only time jerma gets to see the chat is when he's not streaming
I mean, I'm sure it's a lot of people
I'm pretty sure you can just turn the volume down, it's louder
this is the most expensive game ever made
You've been playing this game for an hour.
if you use the axe, it'll do more damage
go to the middle of the map
You just spent 50 dollars on a bowl of peanut butter
You can play it at the same time as the new emote
put on the new Sam and Max song please :)
It's not a bug, it's a glitch
you can get a shotgun with the free gun
you can jump into the pipes to get up
i dont think theres a tutorial at this part
I've never seen someone do this in my life
what is your opinion on the quality of this game?
i hope we get to hear this song again
i feel bad for this guy, but i want to see his brain break down
why do you have a mustache?
is it just me or is this game really hard
I really like the stream today Jerma :)
oh shit its a new emote i never knew
do you know that this game came out in 2008
Jerma do you have a plan for when you're done?
You can do it in one hit, just a few hits

I'd be so happy to play with you :)
Is this the guy that beat Dead Rising 2 on stream?
you know who has the best head? Ster
how many times will jerma get mad this stream
i want to be the one guy
Have you tried the new Smite mobile game?
if you do it again, you can do it again
can you play some of the music from last night?
That was the last thing I expected to hear in this chat
you guys are like the most genuine people I know
I want to go to bed, but I can't watch the stream :(
Have you played the new Metro Exodus?
we're all here for you please keep streaming
They have to be in the same state
I love how this game is just an elaborate version of the original Deus Ex:Human
Hey when are you gonna play Red Alert?
you need to be in the right place
I've been waiting for a Jerma stream for over a year
why do you think you're the only streamer that can read chat
oh i thought it was for the vod
the carnival stream is like a 5 hour
====================
THEYRE GONNA BE THE SAME AS ME IRL

You're making me want to play this game more
im trying to get a laugh out of you, please stop
do you have a plan for the carnival stream
You're not supposed to be naked at this point, just turn around and walk out
I just want to say that this game is amazing and you know it
he's gonna do a stream where he just lies on stream
Is this the streamer who killed Santa Claus LIVE on stream?
you can make a new character with the axe
put a picture of you on the poll
you need to remember to enable the emotes
what if they say you're in a video game
I didn't know you were a sports announcer
Did you see the new Super Mario Bros. 2 trailer?
oh my god I just came back, what the hell is going on

The only way to win is not to play
you dont need to be in the sewer
he's gonna have a stroke live on stream
you have to do it in the air
Jerma, you need to finish this level. It's too long.
Jerma are you going to play this game again?
Jerma you're gonna be in debt for this

you need to cut the trees down

I thought you were going to get drunk

I'm looking at this guy's chat right now
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE JUP jermaJup3 jermaJup4

You can turn it off in the settings
you need to go to the black hole
if you like this game so much why not try more of it?
you can make a new character with the axe
I hope you play this game with a controller :)
The word "cringe" is a reference to "Cringe"
youre gonna have to put on a hat
what did you think of the new monster?
jerma i'm eating some of your poop right now
this is why you don't eat grass @Jerma985
you got a pet rat, you can get one with a mouse
I'm from the future and I'm sure you have a dream about you
You can do it! You can do it!
I can't believe you threw the controller out the window
you can make a character with the axe
what the fuck did you do to your hair
its like a chicken or a ham
You have to go up the ladder
hey jerma can i get a -2
You know what the fuck are you talking about
you have to turn it off or else it's gonna get stuck
How much did you pay for this game
you have to jump and hit the wall
what if we kissed in the Jerma Rumble
YOU NEED TO GET THE CARTOONS TOO BIG
Your camera is on but not the game
you got a good rung of hair
What is the objective of this game?
I've only ever watched a single episode of the show
It's a new level, you can't beat it.
the next one is gonna be a sequel
i can't wait to see the rat movie
you guys should be like "YEAH! HE'S THE ONLY ONE"
YOU CAN MAKE A NEW CHARACTER WITH THE LADDER

====================
TOES
What's the joke of you not being able to figure out the puzzle?
can you play Mother 3 OST please
you could be a voice actor for any character in this game
Theres a mod that changes how you can summon villagers
you should play team fortress 2 at some point
Jerma, you can't just say "this is great" in the beginning of a stream
I remember when you played this game :)
you should play with ster for the coop stream
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I LOVE YOU AND I HATE YOU
This is a really good game, please play it!
Jerma, you're doing great. It's the only way to progress
Do you have a copy of the new Call of Duty?
why does jerma have a room full of toys
you can give him the other red heart
you just get a bunch of new ones
I bet you could have been a poptart
this game is so weird to watch but so fun
you just need to have a better idea
I thought it was a good idea to get the other one
I thought that was a cartoon for a second
you can do a speedrun of this game
you can make a channel point reward
theres a new one you can click on the screen
He's just going to play it forever
I just got here what the fuck is going on
I think it's a bit too much for you to handle
there's a secret room on the second floor
this is just the wizard of oz
Jerma you need to stop trying to sell your soul for money
do you have the "reload" button?
can you play the new game, it's called Black & White
I hate this game it's so fucking boring
This game is just a compilation of jermas old videos
Jerma your voice is so bad its making me puke
You can see the sun in the top left
I think you can just use a shield or something
i'm so glad this is a live action "revenge of the sith"
I've been watching your streams for like 6 hours and I'm still not used to it
Hey Jerma you have been playing this game for 6 hours
you can get a new one with the bonus room
have you ever played the new dlc of this game?
I'm so glad I came back and Jerma is still playing this
you can make the other one of the same color schemes
Are you gonna play the new hulk game?
I think you should play more heroes of might and magic
I think he said that a few times
You know the one where you played this for an hour?
you can't even see them if you don't have your facecam on
what if the dog is just a guy named "Jack"
did you forget about the ice level yet?
I'm glad Jerma is finally getting to the point where he doesn't have to deal with the constant spam of sub noises
theres a secret room on the second floor
I think you can get a chainsaw with that
you can use the jumps to go in the water
why do you keep putting your head on the top of the table?
theres a secret room on the second floor
its a good game, you gotta play it
can you turn your mic volume up?
I can't believe I missed the stream, what's going on
You can make the other one of the same color scheme
I was just checking out the stream and came across this
you can get a chainsaw with that chain
I remember when this was a Lifeline stream
you can make the other one of the same color scheme
If you want to know how to play the game just download and try it out
im going to try and get a high iq test
if you have to use the "play music" thing it means you have to turn your volume down
you know you can do it right
This is just like that one time Jerma said that he was going to play BOTW
this is like the first time that stream has ever been delayed so much LUL
I thought you were gonna say "I
====================
.
i hate this game and all of chat
just joined and am so confused as to what is going on
i feel like im in the bathroom right now
why do you keep saying the word "M"
you know what they say about a good boy
You can go to the river in the map and wait there, it's a shortcut
I can't believe Jerma got so mad at a game
i think you're about to fall off the cliff
we need to have a new jerma face
you can go to the pond and wait there
JERMA GETS LATE AND GETS BANNED FROM TWITCH
Just got back, what the hell is happening?
you should play the first game of the series "The Movies"
Jerma I just got here and I already have over 40 hours of sleep.
what if i just like the game :)
I'm going to go to bed now, you're late.
why is jerma so bad at this game
you can use it for a number of things
you can find a list of all the games in the archive
you can put a village on the world map and it's really easy
you have to hit the start button on the gamecube version
I can't believe I'm gonna miss this stream
I'm glad that I'm not the only one that thinks this is cool
you can just go to the pond and wait there
can you tell the story of how you beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
you have to pay the debt before the debtors arrest you
Why does this game look like it came out of a mobile game?
make the facecam bigger so it looks like you are talking to yourself
you should watch the new resident evil movie
I want to see the first 15 minutes of it
I'm not sure if you're familiar with this game, but it's basically a game of chance
the music in this game is so good
play the dlc or else you're not a true fan
You're supposed to use the car to get to the store
You don't have to do it every time
do you know how many jerma coins you have?
please tell me you actually didn't have to do it
we know you have a heart monitor but what about the time you tried to put your hand over your eye
This is just the "Boomer tries to do not know" bit
you can go to the pond and wait there
they just have the same kind of buildings as you
He's gonna lose it like he did the last game
you can go to the pond and wait there
JERMA PLAY THE WHOLE GAME RIGHT NOW
It's a good thing the game isnt trying to make you play it
put a tentacle creature in the middle of the camp
If youâ€™re gonna play the other games, youâ€™d have to play the original
you can get a new car with this
what is this game, is this the new Smash Bros. ?
you can go to the pond and wait there
jermaSour when you shit your pants in the shower
what do you think of the new Super Mario RPG
can you go back to the beginning of the game please
I remember when jerma wasnt a fuckin chad
Are you doing a bit with the old people?
I think you just need to find a ladder
hey jerma can you turn the music down a little bit
jermaOtto "Moms Making Cookies" is a good song
why are you playing this game? It's not good
you can go to the pond and wait there
imagine paying for a 3d movie maker game
this is the most boring thing youve ever done
why would you want to take the extra time to get the boots?
you should do a tier list of all the games you have
will you ever play Odama on stream
I would be happy if I got a kidney stone
you can do it in real life Jerma
you can use it to go to the pond and wait there
Just look up the controls, it's the same as the PS2 version
Do you know what a M

 Jerma985
"I'm not a boomer" - Jerma as he reads chat
Iâ€™m a big fan of jerma985 and Iâ€™m 6â€™2"
I've seen the worst places to fish, and I hate it
this is the last thing jerma sees before he dies
you can kill the dragon in the lab
you know he's gonna do it by accident
i hope he plays a lot of undertale
i think the title is the song from the metal gear rising stream
jerma is the only streamer that makes me laugh every time
theres no way he is going to beat it
I wouldnt say he's bad, just not as good as you guys
It's gonna be a 10 hour stream
Do you have your bingo card? I'm curious to know
why are you wearing a diaper?
i cant believe the only thing i got was a sub
the vod is gonna be deleted from the vod
you can get a free copy of this game on steam
youre gonna get arrested for fraud monkaS
why does everyone want to see the most fucked up thing
I'm getting a bit of a mental break from this game
you've done this before but you know it
Hes gonna have a heart attack guys, I'm hearing that from my ears
I can't believe he's playing a game about getting lost
i dont think jerma is going to be able to do it
The problem with building a city is that it doesn't have any people to collect taxes on
I would be sad if I was getting a sub.
we can see your toes in the video
you need to buy the boots to be in the party
he's not playing for a long time, he's gonna be playing for 6 months
You can make a dollar off of that
you can get a free copy of this game on steam
hey can you turn down the music
Jerma if you do a 24 hour stream I will send you a present
it's a really good game, just not very good for 2 year olds
Iâ€™ve been watching jerma since 2013 and heâ€™s never played a video game before.
theres a reason you can't use the railgun
you don't know what a radio is, right?
you know you can do it if you have the time
why do you keep running into the wall
This is just the Rat Movie from Rat Movie
put on the horned cap of a griller
How do you feel about the death of Santa?
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
this is just a really long mission LUL
you're too tall to be a dog
JERMA YOU'RE GONNA BE BOPPIN IN YOUR MOUTH
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN HELP YOU IS A BEAUTIFUL CHAT
i mean if you say "yes" you do
I would never let this happen
he doesnt know about the dialogue, he already has the dialogue
it's the same as the first game LUL
Jerma you just got arrested for shoplifting jermaPluto
I thought the whole stream was this game
what if you were doing the same thing but you're not
I would be upset if I was watching this
why is there a filter on the bottom left
your vod is gonna be muted.
This is going to be a 6 hour stream
jerma is the only one who gets to play the game
I would like a hand to show you my boomer brace :)
I think you need to do a voice
YOU HAD THE BOOTS FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES jermaVenus
Jerma, you don't have to be a doctor, you can just say "I know what you did"
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I want to see you play the game, play with your friends
it's your birthday today! cake and ice cream is on its way!
don't worry, I have a sticker on my door that says "YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS"
they are a little bigger than you
You can get a free copy of this game on steam
It's like, the same as the first game
====================
do a tier list of your tier lists
jermaOld Old man with a gun to my head
you know i'm something of a scientist myself
I've been watching this stream for an hour and a half and I've never seen this game.
it's not the way you're supposed to play it
I just got back from dinner, what's happening
we're gonna be here for an hour and a half
you need to watch the movie jerma
i dont understand why people are saying it sucks
it's just a reskin of the game :)
they're just messing around with the game so far
he said he was going to play the next game tonight
Jerma please stop playing this game it's actually boring.
jerma how do you not know the game
I can't believe you fell for the ghost pepper joke
i dont think you can play this game
I'm not sure, you should get it sorted
That's what you get for the new raid
Jerma I just got here can you turn it off
Jerma should play more of the old games
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2478. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i'm not a mod, im not a jerma fan
youre supposed to be using the right stick
I thought he was gonna say the next hour
why do you have an AEWO on the screen
it's a real game how do you not understand it
I would like to see you play the original Dead Rising 2
i feel like the stream is just gonna be prerecorded
You need to get to the part where you die
you're supposed to be streaming the final fantasy games
I'd rather watch a grown man play a game for the first time
you can shoot the gun with it, its called a gun
I don't think this is the right place
I can't believe Jerma would do this to us jermaPluto
I love how much he knows about this game LUL
YOU SAID YOU WOULD PLAY THIS GAME
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY TO GET OUxton
that's the worst thing i've ever seen in my life
I got one of those from the yard sale, and it was a great looking game
it's the one in the back
I'm gonna go watch the vod from 3 hours ago
oh wait i thought he was gonna say "hey guys"
How long has he been playing this game?
i wanna see if i can hear that
I feel like Jerma is like a small child learning to read
Jerma you've been playing this game for an hour
if you're good at something never do it for free
you have to get all the stuff in the top right to make the right decision
THE KEY IS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE START OF THE LIBRARY
you can use the cheat code "TUBER" for a free copy of the game
you have to do it again if you don't
you gotta go to the last area
You're the only streamer I watch that isn't a VR game :)
I'm in the bathroom can you pause the game?
He's gonna get so mad at that game
why are you trying to pretend to be a clown
You said "Let's get a new job" the whole time
The last game was good, but this one is worse
you are in the middle of a room
I think the last game was really good
I'll be honest I don't know how to deal with chat
it's a good game but it's not good enough to have a stream to justify it
why is jerma playing a bad game
You can't say that, you're gonna be banned from every game ever
You can just do a few voices at once
You're gonna get the bad ending because you're bad at the game
jermaHeart jermaHeart I'm just going to sleep, thanks for the stream
Jerma I'm so tired of this game and you're playing it.
I'm waiting for the stream to start again.
there are a lot of games you can play, but this one is a bit buggy and I'm not sure if I can get into it
I love how the speedrun is like 6 minutes
you can use the cheat code "TUBER" for a free copy of the game
you can
====================
 but they never got it
you dont have to hold the buttons to open doors
Can you turn the music up a bit?
Why do you have so many guns you can only have 1
I have a high iq and i'm an adult
Hey, first time viewer here. I'm really excited for the stream.
We need you to make it to the next room
You can tell me if you need to
if you die in the game you die for real
i think this is the most difficult game to get into
I can't believe he got a sub right now
please make a video of it for the awards
you should have just made a playlist of all your videos
i think its because you were supposed to be streaming for 3 days straight
you can go to the sewer level
I'm on mobile, and the stream isn't working
You're just saying it because you're bad at it
Why does he look like he's from the original Dead Space
I just got here, why are you playing a childrens game
I'm the one who wants to see you beat this level
we're on the top of the mountain
I've got my own stream for the week
I'm going to have to get some sleep too
are you gonna do a stream of just talking
I think you need to get a new mic or something
you can't just say that like that LUL
if you can't get a perfect perfect, then you're a moron
have you seen how they're doing it?
theres a secret door on the second floor
theres a little bit of water on the roof
I'm not even sure if this is a joke
Did you ever play a demo of this game?
im a friend of the creator of this stream
you should do an IRL cooking stream @Jerma985
you did it by putting the camera down and blinking in the dark
you don't need to go in the water
can you turn up the music in options?
i love how they're all really great for the first few hours
you need to put the gun on the table
I mean, you don't have a lot of time.
jerma is gonna be in a drunk rage
can you explain the story of this game?
You can literally get the perfect on any given day
I'm begging you, I've got the greatest gift of all time
they were supposed to be like 10x bigger than they actually are
i mean you could have been playing the original game
you can go into the sewer and pee
The game is not working, please restart
Go to the first part of the game
This is like watching the stream live
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I'm a little annoyed that I'm not the one that got this
there are people who would watch you play this game
I am actually going to do something bad if you don't play Nancy Drew
Oh I get it he's got a virus
You can play both if you want to play at the same time
I can't believe Jerma died to the tutorial boss in lifeline jermaPluto
if you don't beat this game i'm gonna cry
I can't believe they added a toilet to the game
jerma, when is the stream with the world record?
What's the joke, is it that you're all on crack?
You need to get the red and blue coins
I'm a little more annoyed that I'm not the one playing the original game.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 14. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I think the first time you died on this boss was in the last game, you get a bad ending.
I dont think you know what a toothpick is
I want you to play the game so bad
He doesn't know about the secret door on the second floor
we got the whole point of the game
The only thing you have to do is get the right one
that's a lot of blood you guys
You need to get the boots first
You are going to die in the next 30 minutes
I think you're making a terrible joke
hey jerma, it's me you're talking about. I'm doing this
Jerma's current
====================
 I just got here what the fuck is going on
You need to go to the next room

So when are you going to play Fistful of Frags?
This is a lot of work for one guy
he's just gonna play a game where he takes a shit and it's funny
i dont think youre gonna play this
Oh god, we're gonna be here for hours
this is the dark souls of house flipper
you have to go in the mirror to unlock the secret
I have to use my wink right now
you need to be a sub to post links
you can make an extra hero in the town
you can also make it so they can keep their own place
it's not a joke, it's a crime! :)
If you don't finish this, I will kill you
I think you can hit the ground when you are too close
i cant believe you would do that
You just need to grab the big one
jerma i have to go to bed please hurry
you can also make it so they can keep their own place
this is like a fucking movie game for boomers
you can get them in the town
theres a ton of them, you should check them out
you have to set it to 100k
I can't believe the moon is a lie
How can you get to the bottom of a mountain like that
If you get this to 100,000 I will donate my life savings
I wouldnt be surprised if you have a criminal record
you can get new heroes with the rez
I'm from the future, can you tell me what happened
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE ABILITY TO TALK TO TRANS PEOPLE
i bet you're wearing a tshirt on stream
He's been here for a while and he's already lost it
this is the most boring thing youve ever done
why do you look like a fake doctor
I dont know what game this is but im going to play it
HahaThisisfine time to get the fuck out of my life
Jerma, the game is over. You can't leave now.
This is like a childrens game. You are playing as a 13 year old.
you have to find the water source first
I'm going to go to sleep and wake up to a new year
oh my god is that a seagull PogChamp
I just got here can you get me a follow?
I'm not a redditor but I'm here to say hi
I'm not gonna say it because I'm not a sub

are you planning on playing the new pokemon game?
I'm gonna get a drink, take care of yourself, see you soon! jermaHeart
you can get new heroes with the rez
I can't believe this guy beat DARK SOULS 3 on stream
this is like a fucking train wreck
"i'm not gonna do it" "no" :)
Jerma will never play the game that's on the PS2
he's doing the same thing with the new costume
I'M SHAKING. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S STREAMING THIS
you can make a town and make your own army
You have to go to the fountain first
theres a ton of secrets in this game, you can get them from chests
YOU CAN GET NEW AIMS WITH THE NEW AIM
you can get new heroes with the new icon in the town
you should get a new hero. You can get new heroes with the new icon
you need to find the water source first
I hope he gets to the secret boss
jermaPluto I think the green screen video was muted
I've been waiting for you to play this for so long.
I don't know if you've played this game before, but it's a porn game
you can get new heroes with the new icon in the
====================
TheIlluminati @Jerma985

i got a new burger, what do i get
jerma is a god gamer and he is going to beat this level on stream
can you play the game that's on steam right now?

Jerma, you don't have to play this anymore.
do you have a cooking mama mod?
hey jerma I made a video on my birthday about you
Are you going to do the vr streams in the future?
they dont do that so its not worth it
why is there a guy running over a truck
why does he look like he has a super bowl hat on
The only thing that gets me is a wine glass
you could have just bought the game
you can use the building portal to get to it
You have to get the free car
you don't have to be a boomer
I love how you say that, I love you
YOU CAN GET THE CARNIVAL STREAM WITH OTTO
"I'm not a weirdo" - Jerma 2019
This is the worst game I've ever seen
why is the voice actor so nervous?
just wait till you get to the final boss
You don't have to walk the whole way
why did you think that was a good idea
What the fuck is wrong with this game
I don't want to go to bed
you can see how much fun the game has having fun
you gotta win the game or the stream is ending
You can change the color of the icons in the settings
you can unlock the secret ending after this
You got a few more hours of the stream
Can you please say "Yeh, you need to go to the doctor"
you're so far ahead of the game I love it
you can't just start doing them all at once
there is a bunch of them. there is a couple of them that are easier to do

i can't believe you died to pinwheel

can you please say "pepe" im trying to study
this is the most generic game of all time
You can change the color of the icons in the settings
Is this the streamer who can't make an angry noise?
It's not a joke it's a fact
You can get the new house by doing the village hall quest
you don't need to talk about that
you could have just done it on stream and gotten the game
i cant believe i did that to my face
you should be able to get a save
It's a bit late to be honest
You have to talk to the police
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
this game is so much better than i remember
i want to see the part where he goes into the cold war room and kills all of the civilians
you can buy the next house in the village
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2506. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you can make the entire village look bad
I'm just gonna say it, Jerma's the best streamer on Twitch.
I want to see the fucked up face
I can't believe Jerma's going to play another game for the next four hours
@
====================
"
do you want to play on hard mode
you know you can always replay it if you dont like it?
jermaPluto he can't see us, he's lost all his brain cells
the one guy in chat is the streamer
I'm so glad jerma is playing this game
you can just leave the game and come back and come back and you'll be fine
this is like the one game i was working on
jermaOld do i have a deep voice or something
the sun is the only thing that matters
it's like an actual air balloon or something
Please just play the first one, it's actually good
you have to go all the way
did you see the new Twitch layout?
I'm not sure if he has any idea what's going on
You need to get all the way to the safe room
I just got here, did you see the new Jerma lore?
you know you can just go to the casino and gamble
you have to talk to the guy next to you
Can you please turn up the music?
please turn the game off im trying to watch the movie
this is like the only game that uses the same soundboard
just make a level and have it auto-save every time you play
you can only buy the ring from the merchant
YOURE A LOSER AND YOU ARE THE WORST LOSER
i was gonna tell you he was a dong
jerma please beat this so i can go to sleep
you have to have the boots to kill him
you can see the jump in the bottom right
If you eat a shoe how many teeth do you have?
You can always go back to the lab to get the boots
he was a top 1000 streamer for a while
this is like that scene in the movies
you're gonna die in 3 days and we're not even halfway done with this game
imagine if he actually got the boots LUL
i wish i could watch jerma play minecraft anymore :(
That's because the game is a big, 3d game, so you need to sculpt it
jermaPluto I want to play this but I'm scared of him
you should try to get the boots
the fuck is this guy talking about
theres a secret area in the game
theres a secret item in the game
you're not even halfway done with this game
I'm gonna miss the stream this month, i'll be back soon
You should try to find a community made game with a better soundtrack. I think you'd like it.
You can put the shotgun in your pocket and carry it around with you
This is the most honest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen
have you seen the new Scooby Doo game?
what is the point of the store?
just do what you have to do
go to the bathroom, the game is over
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen
how does this game even have a social security number
Jerma you can't do anything about it, you just beat it
it's not a bad game, but it's not great
The game is full of that...
I'm gonna be so disappointed if this doesn't work out
you're like a 5th grader, get a better job
You don't have to tell me it's a lie
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel
you can make the house out of taffy
You're not gonna get to the first part of this game?
didnt jerma say that he would play persona 5?
you have to do the other side
I'm gonna miss the stream this month because of all the shit I gotta do with work, the stream is cancelled jermaPluto
YOU HAVE TO KILL THE MAN AND EAT HIS ASS
i remember when he used to stream from the bathroom
you should play it with etalyx sometime
I'm sorry I'm late but can you please start the stream and tell me how to finish my chores
play dmc2 ost for the game
I can't wait for the chat to grow ever larger
you're supposed to get them out of the way
I think you
====================
 This is just a meme of course it's a meme
i was a kid and this is what you get
You should play Sam and Max for the Nintendo Wii
You don't have to say it, it'll be a good joke
This is like if the Simpsons hit and run
I think you just saw the worst thing youve ever seen
If you're reading this, you're fucking DYING
you should play a game called Glueman's Song
you were supposed to shoot the grenade in the gun
Why is this game so much more entertaining than the original
you have to have a few people in the crowd
jerma you're gonna get sued for this game
i really like your stardew valley streams
will you ever play the next game?
What the hell do you mean by "slap"
you can keep the ones with the hook
do you have any plans to play more Kenshi?
I don't know what the fuck happened but I'm excited for him to play it
You can take a load off with your regular attack
you can only take it off with your normal attack
It's not a part of the game
put on the new fortnite ost, it's the same song
i'm playing diablo 2 right now and i've got a long list of heroes
You don't have to do anything, just press A+B
remember to run the ball when you have 2 seconds left in the clock
i bet you would have won if you had a million dollars
the real deal is you need to have the entire cast in the same room
if you wanna play more, just have a discord server
you can go into the black hole at the end of the map and go to the black hole
Jerma, you need to be on a specific schedule for this
Hey guys, Jerma here, with another gaming commentary. I'm going to give this video an 8/10.
you can eat the ghost pepper but you cant get the ghost pepper
JERMA YOU CAN DO IT I BELIEVE IN YOU
How can you not like it? Its got candy!
you can't use it, you can't use the shotgun
This is the best stream of 2020
no you need to use the boots
I hope you're having a good day :)
This is so much better than the first one
you can do it, just don't do it
this is the best stream of 2020 if you dont know what youre doing
you can use the shovel as a weapon
this is a really good bit if you missed it
You have to get out of the way
this is a lot of fun to watch
you can do a fake death counter
what is the point of this game if you can't beat it
This is the best stream of the year
do you have any idea how much money you are spending on this game?
play the game as a joke i want to see it
theres a guy who lives in vegas and he doesnt want to see you
You just lost all your money, you have to refund it
you got a good chin and a good back
I'm gonna go watch the stream live now, thanks for the entertainment :)
I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
I'm having a good time, I'm not gonna watch this stream anymore
can you turn the music down please
youre just trying to get away from the camera
Jerma, you can use the shovel as a weapon. It's really useful for farming
jerma you should get a grip for your controller
You can see it with the webcam though
do you have any idea how much money you are spending on this game?
you just got to the end of the map
you can use it as a melee weapon
you can't just say "nope" and not be able to figure it out
you just had to do it a few times
Jerma I was gonna ask if you have ever played The Quiet Man, but I just realized it's a shitty game
I think you can get them off the ground
The first part is really good, but you have to finish it
You can find more in the options
====================
This is just the dlc, you can beat the game now
what if it's the last game of the day?
you can use the torch to make torches
It's just a guy who made a video about a guy named Jerma
you got a lot of viewers when you played this
you should watch a live action jerma rumble
You should make a new character, he's kinda cool but not very good
You're gonna be in the desert for years, and years, and years
just make sure you get a good set of teeth
i cant believe you beat this game on stream
you just gave me a heart attack
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS THE POWER BUTTON
when you get to the point where you need to get the boots
I think the last time I was here you were still playing this?
Why is it so hard to tell which ones Jerma is talking about
i like to just listen to music while playing this
imagine if you were in a movie movie and you just had to fight the director
theres a funny clip of you playing a game
you just said that you were going to do the game awards this year
are you gonna play the next game?
we don't have a twitch, we have a reddit
It's a good game but it's too hard
it's not a mirror, it's a sphere :)
You should probably get a camera for this
he's going to fucking die, what a sad little human being
you're really missing a lot of content, do you really want to watch this stream
Are you going to play the new Animal Crossing
You're looking like you have a heart attack
you can stack the buckets on the table
you can play the piano to this song
you need to turn off the light in your room
I'm still trying to understand the link
He's going to get out of the ring
Do you think you'll ever play TF2 again?
is it true that you're never coming back to this game
I'm just glad you're not a streamer anymore :)
you can see the top of his head
jerma is the only person in the world to have a rat
You need to get the boots for the boots
you can get a lot of xp in this
I'm sure you're not the only one who doesn't like it
you're still playing this game? I thought you were doing a stream with a new game?
why do you keep putting the fish in the ocean
jermaJex jermaJex2 jermaJex2 jermaJex2 jermaJex jermaJex2 jermaJex jermaJex2
just the dark souls of star wars
Jerma you're a redditor, we know that you have a bad sense of humor
he was just trying to find the way back
Iâ€™m so happy Jerma is finally playing games again
You can use the torch to make torches
is this the streamer that got 1/10th of the way through the game?
why do you look like a human?
you should play this for the first time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NmVhFnSzU
Jerma is the only one who didn't buy the game
have you considered a team fortress 2 remake?
jerma is going to go to bed now
you can use the torch to make torches
I would watch this game for a solid hour
that's why you're so good at it
jermaVenus you can't be a teacher, you're a GAMER
if you fail that joke you'll be in jail for life
i want to see your feet on my face
he's not going to eat your shoe
It's like the beginning of a video game
This game looks like a shitty Spiderman movie
you need to get the boots for the boots
jerma's gonna die from a heart attack
theres a secret in the closet you can unlock
you just need to make the right side big and left side small
@Jerma985
====================
This
jerma would probably be able to kill himself by himself
DO THE FINAL SONG YOU WERE JUST TOO FAR
You're supposed to go through the portal in this game
this is just the halo 1-10 thing from like a few years ago
You can get the middle one in the dlc
the water is in the bottle for you
do you have a date set for the carnival stream?
I love how the little girls have so much power and are able to turn into giant, spider-man
I love how you have been playing this for hours and you just keep playing
You're gonna get 100 points from this stream.
its on your first try, its a real thing
how does this game have the same weight as mario 64
You can do it Jerma, you just have to do it
this is the second time youve said that
you're the only person who would do that
I wonder if Jerma has a spotter to the left of the road
You got a really big sword, yeah
you were really wrong about that but I'm glad it's over
you have to buy the gamecube one
If you die to pinwheel you get a free copy of Mario RPG.
that was the worst thing i've ever seen
He's gonna use it on the next mission
Jerma is a man of his word :)
I'm so glad I got my sub this stream
you can do it again you have to finish this one
It's so bad that you could only get one in a week
I'm not a sub, but I'm a sub so I can't sub
you could have just said you were gonna play something else
you've been in a coma for a week
You know that's a big game when you hear it
I'm playing Darkwood right now, I'm so excited
you can use a bidet to make a sandwich
i've only ever played the sims so i don't know if its really that good
i wish i could be a vr mod
You need to get a good understanding of the game
this is gonna be a 5 hour stream
you can get a lot of health items from the floor
you look like a child playing with a mouse
I don't think he's ever gonna get past this part
When are you doing the sims 5 level?
imagine the person who made this game was jerma
jermaWalk THE WALL IS THE BEST PART OF THIS STREAM jermaWalk
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2488. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
Jerma i have a new sub badge please send it to me jermaPluto
what do you think about the new vegas area?
play the vr game it's free on the Epic Games store
you have to go back to the beginning
the game looks like it was made by a group of people who made it
you can do it for free if you have a gamer license
I think you have a lot of them
jermaOld Old boomer voice i cant read anymore
do you think you'll ever play the new Animal Crossing?
I'm glad I got a sub :) thank you :)
you need to know what you are doing
You know what I'm saying? You're getting old.
you look like the evil boomer dad from that old ed edd and eddy movie
You need to be in the left room
you should play the game in order
i think you can play as many as you want
what do you think about the new vegas area?
If you die in the game you die in real life
This is not how you're supposed to play this game
YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING AND NOT STOP
you can buy other items from floor
Jerma you need to make the cow eat
You can get other items from floor
is this the streamer who was in a coma for a week?
I'm out of the loop, but what the fuck is happening?
i'm glad you like the game :)
the only way to stop him from being too drunk is by saying he sucks
@Jer
====================
 on the radio
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOU IN A SPIT
i wanna see jerma play an actual game and be like "Oh god I'm gonna die"
when are you gonna play nancy drew
There are people who watch this streamer in the kitchen
theres a dead body in the corner LUL
i love how he just said "get a job"
You should try to finish this game with a blue shirt
imagine not being able to write something down in a document
I wish I was the one who said that
It's not a penis, it's a penis! jermaVenus
it's not like you can tell us what you're playing

Just got here, is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?

This is going to be a disaster
he had a whole week to recover from the colonoscopy
You know, you can't just tell us what to do.

You should play the original Dead Space. It's a great game.
This guy is literally a giant rat LUL
I don't think I've ever seen someone so bad at the game
this game has an extra level of difficulty

It's really easy, just do it a few times
i love that they do this when they're trying to play
what about the time you said you'd play this for 5 hours?
I think you need to go to the bathroom
jermaPluto I'm sorry Jerma I'll never forgive you
if you have a cold, do you need to go to the doctor?
I can't believe he got banned from Jerma Rumble jermaPluto
hey jerma can you do a regular stream for the next few days?
do you have the game from yesterday?
I have a 4 year old and I've never seen a controller before.
i can't believe this guy died to pinwheel
I'm getting scared by this game. I'm scared of being watched
"i want to see you kill people" jermaOld
you can just walk to the ladder in the lift room
you should play some of the other ones
I was born in 1884, I'm a bit old

I'll give you $20 to beat this level
it's not a rocket launcher, it's a rocket
I think the way you're describing it is a lot like the way that you're describing it is a lot of the same thing
I'd rather watch a bunch of people play this game than a jerma stream
you can't just put a different place for it
I don't know if you're joking or not, but that was my favorite
If you do the tutorial again, I'm unsubbing
i will be so mad if you don't play the DLC
I'm trying to get to work, can you please restart the game?
when you have no clue what you're looking at
you cant be a mom to your kids
you can use the grenade launcher to get back up
How many times have you died to pinwheel?
Are you going to play the sequel?
I'm glad you decided to play the original game. It's been years of amazing content and I hope you enjoy it.
Have you ever played Black and White 2?
if he doesn't show up in 15 minutes, we're legally allowed to leave
You have to pay for the other channel
Please play the rest of the game please

Just do it until you're a full time streamer
i just came back what the fuck is this
you have to get the seeds from the trees
if you don't beat it, I'm going to sue you
I want Jerma to play the original Dead Space
imagine not having a good time with your family
it's too late to do it again LUL
you don't need the boots, you can just jump off the bridge
jerma why are you so obsessed with your internet
I have the same issue, they keep re-using the same thing
do you have a clip of the old lady in the bottom right?
the only way to win is to not stream
Jerma what are you doing you psycho
you can't just come in here and say "I'm a boomer"
You can get a permanent badge for 1 cent
it's a little late to call it a night
get some water and start drinking
i think he meant that he wanted to save his sister
"im gonna play dead space 2" - jerma
I can't believe I got a gift sub while this was happening jermaVenus
you can just get a new one
this is like the last boss of ace attorney
theres a stream on the 2nd channel that has the whole tutorial
oh my god it's the same voice actor

just keep going and getting destroyed by the first boss
did you ever play the new nancy drew games?
I had a dream where Jerma was trying to say the B word in a children's game and chat just spammed it
why are you so bad at this game
I think you can get an upgrade if you use the cheat engine
the trick is to not make any mistakes
JERMA, DO YOU KNOW WHAT A VIRUS IS?
You can do the same thing in the next area
it's okay, you can just use the save menu as an example
i thought this was a sega genesis game
you can go to a town and have a little party
YOU NEED TO BEAT THE GAME QUICKER
i'll give you 10 dollars if you play it
What about the time you ate your mom's spaghetti?
you know you can do a nice one right?
I can't believe Jerma actually doesn't know
you missed a few key items in the last level
you can use the save menu as an example
i think you can get a new one here if you try
its like that movie from the get well soon card
I'm gonna go watch the vod, get some food and then come back
why do you have to do this to us
there is a huge difference between the two
you can use the save menu as an example of what you want
this game is like, 2 hours long
why do you have so many health bars
you can do it now, just take a break
it's not the game it's the people in chat
How much of the game is left? NotLikeThis
you can do it with the little girl
go to the planet and look for the door
what the fuck did I just tune into
theres a save menu as an example of what you want
i wonder if jerma has a mom of his own
That's what happens when you don't do the tutorial
im actually so confused what is going on
theres no way i'm gonna beat this game
@Jerma
====================
I've been trying to get a job at a mcdonalds since your stream
I dont know what youre talking about but I like you
Are you gonna play any other games today?

You can only have so many subs right now
You're not gonna play the game if you don't
You can only have so many, and they're all worth it
I can't believe he died to pinwheel OMEGALUL

This game is gonna be so boring.

You can hear his heart racing in his voice

Jerma, if you're reading this, you're probably about to die
you just need to look up the menu
you'll get it when you use the power of the light
you can use the spear to go faster
jerma i think you're a chad, you need to be a chad

YOU SAID IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER
you can hear the pain in his voice
what the fuck is this guy talking about
make the facecam smaller for the videos
what if the streamer is a troll and then he gets in a rage
you can set it to auto-fill by going to the options menu and then clicking "Check Engine Results"
Do you have any idea how many subs you have received?
it was a bit earlier than i thought
why is the second floor of a casino so dirty
you can use the power of light to get to the edge of the pool
can you play the original Nancy Drew game please?
I think you can just grab the portal and let it slide out
you can use the light to get to the edge of the pool
why do you hate the game so much

====================
I remember when jerma was a Vinesauce streamer FeelsBadMan
i can't believe you've gone full jex on this stream
You can jump over the gap in the center of the building

Can you turn the music down a bit
jermaOld What is this old man supposed to do

I can't believe you beat the first part of Fellowship
There's a lot of people on the Twitch chat that don't know about the other games jermaPluto
You have to get the other stuff first
You have to finish this game in a couple of hours
you can walk into the boss room in the last area
jermaOld im gonna go get a drink, and then come back to the stream
hey jerma I'm glad you're here. it's been so long and I haven't even started
you are now the #1 jerma streamer on twitch
I'm sorry I've been here for too long :)
I'm glad you're having fun! I'm not sure if you're enjoying this or not, or if you just don't enjoy the game
you should be able to get a whole bunch of tickets for the next carnival stream
It's not a full moon, it's just a long night
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 I'm so hungry, can you please just eat my ass?
It was a very funny joke, but you really should have done it
he's going to get so mad he's going to actually die
get the sword out of the way
You know what is worse, the time you spent trying to save scumming
it's a really good game, but its not for everyone
you're a fucking psycho, but you're not psycho
You guys dont know what a max combo is
I wish there were more interesting streamers, I'm bored of Jerma's shit and want more fun streamers
that was a joke, you got the wrong door
I've been watching for like 2 hours and I'm still confused
how do you think the jup thing works
i hate this streamer and chat, and i hate this streamer
I'm glad you're playing this game for the first time, Jerma. :)
This is the most time wasted stream in a while.
You're not even doing a good job at this game
you can go back to the start of the level
jerma why are you still playing this game
did you do the thing where you said you were going to play Ace Attorney?
it's not a full moon, its just a long night
can you turn on the facecam and do a sexy pose
JERMA YOUR EYES ARE BROKEN IT'S TIME TO PUT YOUR EYES BACK ON
you should play the game with the healthbar
It's not a full moon it's just a long night
It's just a bad joke that's going on all night
this is like the dark souls of mario maker
he's gonna spend all of his bits on a carnival stream
he's not a real gamer he's just a "scam artist"
this is the best stream of the decade
You need to go to the room that you were at
You can jump over the gap in the center of the building, so it's a lot easier
you need to use the light gun
You can make your own pizza and put it on your own shelf
You should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
Why would you want to play this game?
you can go to the center of the building
You can kill enemies from the front of the building
Are you gonna do the Toon Town stream
this is the best game ever made jerma
im just gonna go watch the vod of the last game

I bet you don't even eat your own ass
i love you jeremy it's my favorite streamer ever :)
he was like "haha, I don't have a gun"
I just want to see you play Nancy Drew
he's gonna get a little sick from this
I would love to see Jerma play the new adventure of the spider
====================
he is a kid now, he can't even use the internet
its so easy to use a modded version of this game
what the fuck is going on what the fuck is happening
im a cop and i cant do this jerma
why do you have a chad neck?
theres a hole in the ground, don't forget
you should probably make a save file of all the times you died
jerma doesn't know what a slur is LUL
you dont have to go there on purpose
jerma, you're supposed to be doing this in real life
you're going to get the final boss
the game was like 10 years old
Just make sure you don't put a single grain in your food
You can do it, you just have to be patient
Is this the new Resident Evil? Resident Evil 2
Jerma you need to do more to make up for the fact that you're not a streamer
I can't believe that this guy beat dark souls on stream
how do you know what a duck is
is this the guy that beat dark souls on stream?
your casino is like a trainwreck, its rigged
theres a hole in the ground, don't forget
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP
the first stream was really good, chat was bad
YOU WERE DOING A GREAT JOB :)
please do the "I'm not a zombie" voice
I've heard about this game before and it's so good
why does he have a gun in his hand
jerma i'm begging you turn this game off
what about that guy that made the furry movie
if you dont have enough, you have to get the cow
I've never seen a game that doesn't have a toilet paper holder
Please tell us what you think of the new Outlast 2
you need to get to the end of the level
The green one is the best one
Are you still playing this game or is it over?
i think you can turn off the car in the options
Can you play the new resident evil 2 ost please?
I like how Jerma985 is pretending to be bad at this game
LUL they can just send the message back and forth
jerma can you play some more of that music
it takes like a week to get to the end
this is the hardest level in the game
you need to get a bunch of tickets
That's not how the game is supposed to look
I have never heard of this game. This is a classic
"this is the only one" -jerma
you can do the bonus level in the right one
Why is the hand in the game not a dick?
You can use the arrows to check the shortcuts
try to figure out the puzzle with the mop
I'm gonna take a shower, can you pause the game?
jermaOtto "It is not possible for us to complete this task without the assistance of a number greater than the power of two thousand one hundred eighty-five."
I've been gone for like 30 minutes, and he's still playing this game.
I like how Jerma985 is pretending to be bad at this game and pretending to be bad at the game
Jerma can you please turn the music up please?
its a good thing they did not make a shitty sequel
"I'm not going to buy this game"
are you planning on playing any more of the dreamcast?
You know what you want to do?

you need to be in the right frame
what's your opinion on the new half life game?
You can make any number in the options
we know you're not a fake fan but you can do it
This is the easiest boss in the game
you'll need a ladder to get in the pipe
The new version of this game has a lot of extra features
you can't use the right hand button, it's not working
Play the newest episode of Rick and Morty!

jerma is the type of guy to go to the gym
That's like the lowest I've

JERMA you can use the shield to block projectiles
Hey remember when you said you were going to play ace attorney?

jermaPluto I'm not sure what I want to watch now
you're not gonna beat it on stream, it's a secret
I know you guys, but that would be fucked up
I just got here and I'm already confused
you can buy it in the shop
You need to use the nunchuck to wipe
you can move it in the bottom right
That was a good stream! I'm glad you had fun!
You can now buy the DLC for GTA
It's a way to keep your brain around
is it too late to try the new version?

I dont remember the last time I had this much trouble with it
I'm actually surprised Jerma hasn't done a full playthrough of The Thing yet
you can do a 24 hour stream
jermaDisgust why is everyone here at this point

I'm glad we got to see a very cool game
I just got here. What is this "Jerma" shit?
I think you can beat it on stream
you gotta do the secret missions before you can do the secret bosses
how does he know what a microwave is
I've never played a game before and I don't have a clue what's going on
you have to make the castle your own
I'm so fucking excited for this stream, I can't wait for the second part

You have to stand on the right side of the room to dodge
you can see the buster in the bottom left
I'm going to eat a whole sleeve of oreos
it's okay to be angry, just remember that you are funny :)
If you don't get the coin, you are a fake gamer.
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
Your voice is too low for the game

This is like a child's game. You play as a monkey.

You know what else is a bad game
you arent supposed to do this joke
You should play this game, it's really good
i just got here is this a death stranding stream?
you need to find the keycard in the middle of the room
I got a second copy of this game when I was a kid
you're supposed to use the grapple to jump over the gate
just to see if it worked and I'm done with this
you can see the new emotes in the top right
imagine the evil that would come to you if you asked for a fish
do a stream where you do a "get well soon" card
I think the only good thing about this game is the story
I'm watching the first episode of the series and it's pretty good
how many hours until jerma dies to pinwheel
I think the game is just for your health

i think you can just click the button
do you know what a top bunk is?
just buy a bunch of assholes and show them how to make a city
you can't leave the game, it's like a cave
This is a lot of effort to be fair
the real answer is you are not a real gamer
you should play with etalyx in the back :)
you can make the riddle the whole game
You should play this game with your friends
That's not what you meant by "you have a problem"

I can't believe he didn't get the boots
I don't know what's so good about this game
you know what would be funny if i actually did that?
I'm playing this game right now and I have no idea what's happening
theres a bunch of dlc levels you missed
What if I'm just a living robot?
if you wanna talk about the tf2 thing, I've got a plan
do you have to be in the middle of it?
Jerma please play DMC2. It's a good game.
I don't think the devs knew how to properly do this
you are literally trying to tell us to stop
I don't think the old lady knew about the secret
I have to be honest, this game is pretty fun
you know what they say about a man with a girl tits
i think you're gonna get beat up by the guy who beat this level
Did you try to get the ring from the guy that gave you the ring?
that was one of the funniest streams ever LUL
why is there a shitty hard drive in the background?
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
what are the odds of getting a win?
this is like a max and a goober
I'm watching the movie "The Big Lebowski" right now and it's pretty good
how do you have enough room for an entire town
i would watch the vod of that
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1470. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
You're gonna be a voice actor for the next jerma rumble
What if the game is like 5 years old?
I can't believe I missed the stream :(
you can take it easy if you dont play it
I have to make a jerma laugh
this is the only time i've ever had a co-op stream
just get a gun and shoot them
What the fuck are you talking about, chat?
you have to kill the tree to get the gun
You can buy the actual gamecube one
This is the most disgusting game you've ever played
there's a blue thing on the wall
you have to go to the next area first
jerma i think you've been playing this for like 30 minutes
i can't believe this streamer can't even win a game of chess OMEGALUL
you need to listen to the song again
if you're playing a game for more than 1 day you're a fucking loser
this is the worst fucking thing ive ever seen
you're gonna need to get the boots to climb that
Jerma do you have any idea what the fuck is going on?
You have to do all the other floors
I want to see this man get executed
i have no clue what this game is but i can tell you what to do
I hope you're having a good day
You'll be fine. You'll be fine. :)
put a little more than 1 inch of dirt over the top of the edge
I think the game was rigged from the start
the amount of jumps you can do is ridiculous
I'm glad you're doing this, Jerma! I can't stop farting!
jerma why do you have so many friends
I think it's the devs who made the game
Jerma do you know what a JUP is
i would have had a lifeguard if i had known
you are a part of the problem
I can't believe you guys are still here
when are you going to play space channel 5
When you hit a rock, you can move it to the left
that's why you can't get a girlfriend
you need to put in the effort to get the boots
can you explain the plot to us?
Jerma, you're the one who got this game
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE TRIPLE JUMP
I've been in the hospital for 3 weeks, are you ok?
jerma should play a game where he streams
jermaOld I have to pee pee, come back
"Hey guys, don't be rude" *sounds of piss*
I'm still waiting for
====================
how does he have enough money to buy a house
he was actually gonna do a stream for the carnival stream
jerma's gonna get banned from twitch for using the peepeepoopoo spell
This is the only one I've ever seen
I don't know how much of this is on the screen
can you please just get the fuck out of the way
jerma please play as the rest of the game
Why is the music so weirdly fitting for this game
if you press the start the stream button you'll get a notification that the stream is starting soon
just get some pizza and do a stream
YOU WERE GOING TO BEAT THIS IN ONE TRY
You can move the chainsaw in the middle of the room
This is the best game you've played in a while
it was the same game for the last hour
The guys with the black belt dont wear helmets
you are an expert, and you have a buttplug
How do you feel about your mom being your wife?
you have to do it at the end of the game
When you go to the Casino, you should talk to the dealer
What's the longest you've laughed this entire stream?
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR @Jerma985
just make it a floor, not a straight line
you can get a diamond sword in this game
jerma you're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOOB
this is a really bad idea for a stream
Jerma you can't stop me I'm trying to kill you
I can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR
you have to make a new account
theres a reason they call it a "dummy"
jerma, you're supposed to be a very tall boy
Why does the music sound like a car alarm
i wonder if jerma knows how to use the bulletproof vests
I know you have a lot of health, but do you still have to be in a vehicle?
theres a secret level in the tutorial
I have a bag of all of those cards
oh god oh fuck he has to be in there
i think it was a really good stream
I have no idea what is going on
just do the same thing in the mirror
I can't believe Jerma is actually playing the game
you can move the chainsaw in the middle of the room
how do you like your shoes so much?
The only way to defeat the final boss is to use a chainsaw
the game is designed for this and it works
you can get an iron sword in this game
Theres a secret level in the tutorial
that was your best stream ever. thank you for streaming this game for me.
what the fuck did i just walk into
Jerma the only way to defeat this boss is to use a chainsaw
you have to go through the water and land on it
I got an ad on the news, you're gonna win
we should make a collab where the streamer has to talk to the community
you have to make a new account for the stream to be public
I remember when you streamed your colonoscopy with Joel
You need to put the hose on the gas
You need to make a new account for the stream to be public
how do you even say you hate this game?
how do you get in the shower with that thing
Just a reminder that Jerma is a clown
do you have any plans on playing more Kenshi?
Hes going to sue you for that LUL
It's not a hard mode, it's just a better way to play the game
i think he said you can dodge the knock
Please go to the store, there's a loot room
please turn off the music it makes the voices so much better
it's a real way to play the game
I really want to see the ending of this game
stop talking about how good you are
you need to take the chainsaw out of the middle
they're not the same they're the same
i think the mod is just making you a character
I am a sub and I am not the actual streamer
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not sure
@Jer
====================
Oh my god i can't believe jerma is fucking dead
you need to put your mouth in the microwave
you can throw the grenade by holding down the button
I'm so glad that there's a SUS command for the song
you can hold right click to go to the next level
dont forget to change the language to japanese
Can you get a "jerma" in the chat
just put a log in the center of the table and put it on the top
when do you get to play the new pokemon
can you just say "hey guys" like you have never said anything
you can put the lights on the living room
Ster is just playing some weird game and thinking it's really good LUL
Is this the guy that beat the whole game on stream?
this game is gonna make me fall asleep
I have an ad in my name
would you ever play tf2 with ster?
what's the plan for the next 10 hours?
I hope jerma plays the next sekiro remastered
You should play the new animal crossing music
It's a bit slow but not that bad
this game is actually a better version of this game
you can just go to the "show feet" option in the menu
There is a bunch of people in this town
jermaWalk GIVE US THE JERMA WALK jermaWalk
Would you like to see my tattoo?
i have a hard time with the first level
I dont know what the fuck that is
You need to get to the top of the tower
you are too old to know the truth
I'm going to take a nap, take a pee break, come back when you're back
It's like a high school dance for girls
it looks like a kids game where the teacher has a big dick
You're too old to know the truth
YOU HAVE TO BE A SUB TO GET IN
The whole thing is just a compilation of clips from the past few streams
I can't believe Jerma killed that guy in the hallway of blood
You can put the lights on the living room
I cant believe you're gonna go live with this one
you dont have to get rid of everything
you should check out the new patch notes
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
THE SPONGEBOB IS ON THE WAY TO YOUR HOUSE
You are never going to beat this game, this is why you're so bad
I can't believe he's not a mod anymore
Jerma I just got here why are you playing this game
The game is bad, you gotta go to another game
you have to talk to the other players
you should try a game called "The Binding of Isaac"
you can always just click on the next menu item
The sun is a symbol of our souls, Jeremy
I'm just here for the gameplay, not the gameplay FeelsBadMan
how many people has jerma killed in the past 10 minutes?

the mr. bean is in the room
How much did you pay for this game
I'm so glad I'm here for this stream
you need to get the boots first
you look like a sicko to me

You are playing this as a child
If you don't show Otto in the next 30 minutes, I'm gonna personally unsub
you gotta get the boots first so you can get the boots later
Hes gonna go through all the rooms
Why does this guy have a fucking heart
do a sidequest to get the boots
i'm going to make a shitload of money off this stream
You can put the lights on the wall
you just had to get the boots first
you can literally use your voice to call your mom and dad
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk

I hope Jerma's lost his mind after this
you're in the wrong order, there is a shortcut
you can always talk to the other side
you can't just let them do it
jerma im watching this stream in my room rn
Please say "A" in the movie. It's like a big voice
i've never heard you say something like that
hey jerma, do you think you could make a house?
the rats are gonna get the good ending
Can you play a different game please
Jerma you just made my night. Now I'm shitting myself
It's not even an "A" it's a "C"
you need to find the one that drops them
i've been waiting for this stream for a long time
you could have just played the game, you'd be doing fine
how many months do you have left in the life of this guy
you can do that on your own LUL
What the fuck is wrong with this guy

There's a secret room in the castle
The only thing you can do is not have a job and not have a job
jerma it's not a bad game, it's a bad joke
I thought it was just for one stream

i really hope he does the doom ost
this is the most fun ive ever had watching you play this game
i don't have the time to watch a vod, but i watch the vod :)
I don't think he knows what a keycard is
You should try to get to the bottom of the game before you start
there are a lot of different kinds of games
I'm not sure if it's a joke or if he's really fucking serious
What is this about the dog eating guy?
this is going to be a long one
you have to do a joke about him dying
hey guys i just joined the stream, why is he so angry
do you know how to play animal crossing on the switch
it's not like the game is bad, it's just that it's a little too easy for him
my friend used to play this game with my parents. It's so good
I think you need to bring the filter
How can you not like it? it's got candies!
why do you have a brown filter
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA, DON'T GO HOME
I just got here, what's going on?

I think the stream will be more interesting than the game

====================
you need to get a better boston accent
i just came back to the stream, is he really playing this game again?
this is just the original boston arc with the new intro
can you show us your feet and make us laugh :)
you know you have to do it right
you're not supposed to get it right
this is a little too fast paced for me
I'm gonna go watch the vod after this
you could get a BOTTLE of that and make it taste like shit
my dad just said "what are you doing" and i just choked on my food
you know you need a little bit of sugar?
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB JERMA, A GREAAAAT JOB
I think you're supposed to use the shovel

It's like a child trying to eat a shoe
I can't believe you've been playing this game for 12 hours.

You can use the hammer to open the door
I don't think you're supposed to use a shovel
you can buy it from the vending machine in the basement
You can tell theres a lot of them
Why is Jerma doing this to us? PepeHands
I think it's a zombie because it's in a zombie costume
I want to have a bath with you guys
your ship's morale is low, you should be able to get some more
you should have said that when you said "no"
no you're too high to drink, drink it
why is it that you can't find a way to use your mind?
theres a secret in the ring you need to get
I wish he would stop being a bit late

This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever heard you say "I'm not gonna do this"
what if you get a new account and then no one else will have one?
you should play the game with a voice changer
You need to play the music again
how long have you been streaming? I just came back
you have to go to the big door
the bad guys from the first game are the real bad guys
you should be playing the one game with the camera
you need to do a 20 minute slow mode stream
That's a good one, hope you have a good rest of the stream
There are a lot of different ways to play these levels
this is what happens when you dont use your shovel
I think you need to look at the top of the castle
you need to do a side-by-side, if you're running on the wrong side you're not

You can make a head with this one
I can't believe you were born in 1985
you got your ass kicked by a man in the middle of the street
if you're reading this, you're probably about to pass out
if you're gonna play the game, you better play something else
It's so fucking hard to get people to talk in chat
I would like to see you finish this level
jerma is a zoomer, he knows that LUL

theres a wiki page on this game
What are you playing tonight? I'm gonna go watch Vinny
Jerma is the only one who thinks this is fun
you can't beat the first level, you'll just lose
You know you can just tell them to go to the inn
this is a good way to get a wife
I'm here to tell you that you're not a real gamer
There's a speedrun of this game, it's like 1:13
Please do the dance to Yachtzee @Jerma985

I think this game is really boring to watch
This is why you shouldn't buy a bracelet, you'll get heartburn and die instantly
the mods are doing a good job of stopping the copying and pasting trolls
I remember when Jerma was a funny man

It's been an hour and Jerma is still in the tutorial?

I think it was like 5-6 hours of this game
I'm glad to see Jerma is having fun, even if its not fun for everyone

The bot can't see it, it has to be enabled
there are some new games coming out
You just need to play the game
I'm trying to get over it but I'm too scared to talk about it
would you ever play a good game
I think Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 110. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you need to get the boots first
are you sure this is the last level
this is just like the "I dont know what this is" joke
you gotta play the second one too
when you were a kid you did that

you can find some really good items in this game
It's because you're the one doing the joke
you should play the other one, it's really good
this game is good, but it's not good enough to watch
you are in a cave with a bunch of giant rats
the only thing you can do is do it
is this the streamer that couldn't beat a puzzle on stream?
Have you ever played Noita? I really like it.
This is just the beginning of a horror movie

you're making me want to buy a new computer
You could just make a new game with the music
so you think you're a robot and not a human?
i think jerma's having a hard time keeping up with all the rick and morty
when you're not streaming, you're always at the top of the stream
You can't tell me what to do, Jerma
you should try to do a cooking stream with etalyx
why is he holding the camera like he's wearing a backpack?
you should do a cooking stream like you did with cooking mama
I'm watching the new half life alyx trailer right now
PLEASE do a cooking stream where you cook in front of a live studio audience
That's why you're the only streamer I've ever watched.
you're not allowed to do that, get the bad ending
you need to watch the vod to see your funko pops
I've been following for like 2 years now
its the worst thing you have done

I was playing the game and I missed it
I'm sorry for being rude, but I want to refund this game
I can't wait for the next community content night
this game is just a ripoff of the dark souls of strategy games
the only thing i remember is that you would have been able to get the boots
I don't think he knows what a city looks like
I thought you were supposed to die already
you should have played the new doom on stream
this is like the final boss of a kotor game
what do you think of the new Half Life?
You're not supposed to play this game on stream
you have to do the tutorial again
You have to go to the main menu
You can make your own castle if you have the copy of the game
I hope Jerma gets back on the clown car ride and has a fun time with us.

Jerma is a funny man, don't listen to him
i remember when i was a kid and i cried laughing at the gta vod jermaOld
what if you have to get up off the chair
Jerma i love you but can you stop pretending to be bad at the game
I have the exact same thing, but I'm not a doctor
He doesn't even know he's on the first floor
I'm so glad I caught the stream :)

I love how this game just makes me feel like I'm in a fever dream
You're gonna need to go back to the lab
put on the ring to summon the ghost
I've been here for like 15 minutes and he's STILL playing this
I can't believe Jerma doesn't know about the secret slime action LUL
What if the dreamcast is like a 2000s thing
Jerma have you ever considered streaming on Twitch?
this game looks like a shitty mobile game
Can't wait to see Jerma's massive bellybutton again
I'm not gonna lie, this game looks great
I've been a fan of this game since it was like a PS1 game
How many channel points for a good joke?

how is he this bad at this game
Jerma do you know about the secret slime action?
If you're gonna stream Darkwood, do so at some point. It's been a long time since I've seen you play that game.
I love how he's trying to put it down
You can tell he's just a top 1000 streamer
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
it was a lot of fun but i hope the game gets better
why does he have the backpack on, he's scared
you could have gotten rid of the controller
the first time i've seen someone die on stream, it was a scary experience
HE JUMPS ON THE TRAILER, THEN DOWN TO THE ICE BELOW!
you can do a bit where you just have to beat everything but that's the whole game
you dont need to be a millionaire
I was watching you at work, could you please play my level?
the person below has a heart attack
what is the point of this game if it's just going to be a VR game
You can use a smart click to add and subtract points, it's really useful for your deck
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
Do you know how much you owe us?
You can do it. I believe in you.
I hope Jerma gets the ring for the puke joke
you gotta use the shine on the guard towers
I think you can do the soundboard joke again
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM NOW, IT'S THE GAME
jermaVenus he's gonna end up being a lord of the rings character
This is the most accurate depiction of the American Medical Association I've ever seen
when you get to the hospital it's a bit easier to get in because you can't keep jumping over
i've never seen someone die on stream
I'm here for the streamer who made all of the rules jermaPluto
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
You can do it in a bit to get it in
you know the one in the bottom right?
you could do that for free with like 1 dollar
LUL I don't think Jerma is gonna be able to handle this again
You can put a bounty on whoever gets them
You didn't get the Big Bosses yet
DONT DRAW THE HAT YOU FUCKING NERD IDIOT
can you turn up the music a bit?
you could do it on stream and have a facecam, then you could do this all the time
I'm gonna say the n-word and have it read out loud
jerma you dont need to be a millionaire
its not like theres a lot of people here
this is what happens when you dont make your own cheese
You can use the bombs to heal
You have to find the one who lives there
i think you're playing on the first
====================
you know how to play this game right?
You can't eat a fucking shoe you fool
I saw you at the grocery store, you could've given me some of that snack
you have to have the most energy for the boss fight
If you don't beat this I'm going to fucking scream
I think it's a bit late but it's still a lot
You need to set up your own private channel
I got my first sub in a year!
they can hear you farting but not hear you saying "oh, no"
This game is so good, it's really fun
Make your own show on twitch.tv/drew
Are you gonna play the new Half Life?
i think you just put that on the same day
why do you think that? I'm a furry
jerma doesn't know what a JPEG is
jermaWalk BREEDER BRIGADE WE'RE THE SHIT jermaWalk
you know theres like 2 other streamers that do it
did you know that mario kart was a hit game in 1995
I'm sure the stream is going to be very fun
I don't think you know what a JUP is
I'm pretty sure this game is a ripoff of the original Sonic game.
I'm telling my doctor, you're the best
jermaOld i remember when i was a kid
you can build houses and stuff in this game
This is the best game I've ever played
if you're reading this, you're a very cool guy :)
the part where you have to look at chat isnt funny anymore
You can always watch the VOD on youtube
theres a spot you can find where you can buy the boots
"i just got here" -jerma is late
I can't believe Jerma's playing a game he hates
I can't believe Jerma is losing his mind live on stream
You can make it so it's in the top right
you can use the pogo stick to move
I dont think this is going to be a good stream
you need to do it with the rat
DONT LET YOUR FRIENDS IN YOUR CITY HAVE THAT MUCH
This is the best game ever made holy shit
If you hold shift you can change the game to faster
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
i'm going to go to bed, take care of my body
I'm gonna tell my friends I'm watching this stream
I think you're supposed to hold down the button
You can use the boots to move faster
theres a spot you can find where you can buy the boots
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2478. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you can use the pogo stick to move faster
You're right, I'm just going to say you're the best
did you ever play some of the simpsons hit and run?
I have a feeling that Jerma's going to play this for the whole night
"I'll give you a free pair of boots"
I think Jerma is having a meltdown right now
You're gonna have to do the same for the next couple of levels
I think I saw this on a vod
just a big room with a lot of windows
please put a facecam in the bottom right
you can make it so that you can't see chat in game
You're gonna get a lot of views
It's gonna be like this for the next hour
you can use the boots to move faster
I hope you know what a jpeg is
I hate how every time you mention an anime
you can make it so that it's in the top left
he's not gonna do a single level NotLikeThis
I feel like you would get sued for this
Jerma, you're the only streamer that can entertain us all at once
you can build houses and stuff in this game
do you want to know the lore of this game?
can you sing happy birthday to me
Hey guys, Jerma here, and welcome to the first episode of Jerma's new podcast!
you can put stuff in a house and it'll grow
@Jerma
====================
you were talking about the others but the same thing happened
you could have a team of people to see who gets the most points
i hope theres a new "jerma porn" movie
you're the only one who can do this
you can go to the menu and select the "show stats" option
i'm sure theres a lot of other cool stuff
I'm an artist, I can't use the emote
the nuke will come back, so be patient
this game is a mess and i love it
I'm gonna go get some food now, see you later
What if you had to turn the lights off and on again
"get a bucket of water" is what i do
DO NOT TURN THE MUSIC OFF YOU FUCKING IDIOT
there is a patch for that, it's just not yet
jerma I'll admit it, I really like that game
i think you can play the same game over and over
its a strategy game, you can do it
If you're gonna get into debt, get the fuck outta here
I'm watching a movie with my wife, and she's crying
You're going to play this all night
can you do the worst voice in the game
I'm pretty sure you can get a gamecube gamecube controller with the expansions
what's the best game to play in the old days
That's a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money.
this is the least funny streamer i've ever watched
Jerma is going to get mad at this game
how does he not see the super mario rpgs
we can see it in your monitor
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
If you're not here in 30 seconds, you're not here in 30 seconds.
I'm going to go eat my dinner now
just do it with the controller on, you'll be fine :)
why do you keep saying "You know what, I'm gonna get the boots"
You can't actually do that with the right controller
You have to make him live in your basement
What if there are still zombies in that house?
if youre gonna do it with the right controller you gotta use the left controller
if you're having fun, why dont you just do it with the right controller?
What about the time you said you'd be playing Halo Reach?
You have to bring the vehicle to the house
jerma is literally a top 1000 streamer right now
He's going to beat it in one go
you are doing this for the love of god
they'll just have to do a re-run
I think you just don't like it enough to not like it
Jerma i can hear your teeth grinding :)
I'm a teacher, please stop making the joke.
what the fuck are you talking about?
I'm in the middle of the street and I can see a tiny man in my head
can you say "I'm not gonna get mad"
try to find a tree with a pond
I'm so tired of this shit you can't even play this game
I think you have to make the text grey
I am a fan of your stream and I am so happy you decided to play it
you should play the new song by the band CoolCat
this is just like the original half life
How long has he been doing this level
This is why you don't use the bathroom
The game awards are on the 21st
its like you're in a video game LUL
that's a nice little garden you have there
Jerma would you ever play the sequel to this game?
you can just go to the store and buy a new one
oh my god he's gonna be the only one left
What if you do a tier list of all your tier lists
Jerma you're gonna make me laugh this is too scary
I'm going to puke if you don't play more Kenshi
if you have a sword you can use it to slash the weak enemies
you can't just use the lance to hit the weak enemies
why are you playing this game when you could be playing JERMACRAFT
you should be able to do that
is this the streamer that beat pinwheel ON STREAM
the timer is off, just press
====================
i'm really disappointed in you for not playing the new sims
you can go to the last room
how can he even lose if he loses
it's almost as if you're a weeb
this is a good stream to catch up on :)
you can get the dlc from the map editor
theres a table in the middle of the room, go to it and grab it
YOU CAN GET THE DLC FROM THE MAP
if you were to be in this game, you'd be playing as the Weasel.
I don't know what you're talking about, I don't even have a transcript.
you can get the dlc from the map editor
why is he still playing this game LUL
oh my god this is what he's playing
jerma how long are you gonna keep this up for
its not even a game, its a joke
I hate how it looks like he's just pulling his pants down
this is like the beginning of the stream
is this a 1 on 1 or a 2 on 1
are you planning on playing return of the king
if you hold your mouse over the steam button you can see steam
are you going to play fallout new vegas?
you can do it now, you're just a mess
get a friend to do it for you
YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR YEARS DON'T LISTEN TO THE TRUTH
I think you need to beat it
you can just tell them to go to the menu
You're not allowed to play the game because it's boring
this is what happens when you dont stream
is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
i have to pee can you pause the stream
The next time you enter the sewer you'll be arrested.
you can also just walk through the wall
I feel bad for this poor kid. He's gonna be back here for hours
you need to do the same thing as last time
this is what happens when you dont stream
jermaPluto i wish i could be here too
oh yeah you can also just walk through the wall
theres a crafting table in the middle of the room
how do you know what it looks like
jerma you are a very good actor :)
I don't want to live in a society
i think i saw a meme about jerma being a furry
jerma is a fan of the game and says "i hate it"
theres a crafting table in the middle of the room
why are you still in the bathroom?
they can sell you the whole thing for a penny
I'll trade you a copy of Cubivore
Jerma is a very good actor :)
you can use the knife to stab enemies with it
How do you know what it is
Did you ever play Pokemon Snap? It's the same game but a lot better
that's the one that's supposed to be your main focus
imagine not being able to click the screen
I'm not a sub, but i do watch Jerma
I want to give this a 7/10
There's a crafting table in the middle of the room
Why do you do this to yourself @Jerma985
he's gonna come in and eat a shoe
get the axe to kill him.
i'm in the bathroom and this is making me so dizzy. please hurry up
I just came here and I already hate this
why is the music in this game so goddamn good
theres a crafting table in the middle of the room
You don't have to make a new save, just reload the game
This is like the Dark Souls of games
please stop you're making my child cry
you can do this in a bit
its not a game, its a joke
don't worry, you don't need to walk around in the forest
It's a good thing you didn't do the game
this is a very good game. so much more entertaining than the first game
he's gonna be a pro at this game
It's not a game, it's a joke
the game was so bad it was good
You can
====================
what the hell is going on in here
jermaPluto I just want to make sure this doesn't happen
You know who is the better gamer? jermaOneguy
are you going to play the first ever Mario Maker 2?
dont worry jerma i have a feeling youll be a very good streamer
You should play God of War 2
you should play the new bloodborne trailer
how many of you guys are still watching this
you need to kill the other characters and take their stuff
I'm gonna be honest, I never played it
I feel like Jerma would be good at this game
he'll say something bad if he gets too far away from you
You need to get to the other islands first
theres a shortcut that takes you to the next island
JERMA YOU CAN DO THE COIN TRACKS FROM THE OTHER THING
You should play the game where you get to play as a girl
you got a bad grade in the poll
You gotta do it with the drone
This game is like a flash in the pan
I think you should be more than 1 point away from being in the top 10% of viewers of all games.
I'm only here for the carnival stream
just came back, you're still on this boss?
theres no way he was going to get it
You are too much of a psycho
you should go to the big tree
you're supposed to be using your hands to hold them
You have to get to the other islands first
you have to use the cheat menu
is it just me or does the sound of footsteps make you jump
jermaPluto I don't think he's going to do the final level
this is like a shitty game where you have to fight the goomba
why does this game look like a character model
he's gonna come back and beat it again
you can see the reflection of the lens in the top right
You can see the reflection of the lens in the top right
This is like that episode of Dora the explorer where they do an adventure where they explore a cave and they find a snake
you can just walk up the cliff @Jerma985
jerma im still in the shower what happened
we can't hear you, we're too far away
JERMA YOU CANT HIT THE LEFT BOTTOM OF THE HAND
you just made your own casino that doesnt have a slot machine
this game looks like a fucking fever dream
It was the end of the world @Jerma985
don't worry jerma, you'll be able to do it in like 20 min
JERMA IS GOING TO PULL THIS OFF IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE
you can see the reflection of the lens in the top right
you can do it if you play the tutorial
can you tell us a bedtime story please :)
no its not a 5 star game
that's the same voice actor as the soundboard guy from the movie
are you still doing the star wars christmas stream?
this is a really old game, theres an old version
if you do that again i will literally pay you to never play a game ever again
Can you make the game louder please?
I really want you to play the one where you're fighting a guy
Jerma's going to be the next Michael Jackson
I would rather watch this than play lego star wars
This game is like a 50 year old game
just use a mouse and keyboard to play it
you can see the reflection of the lens in the top right
i'm just gonna go ahead and assume you're actually a bot and not a meme
you can check the footprints in the first place
this is like that one episode of spongebob where they do an adventure where they're trying to find a child and they're just really confused
this is the most painful thing ive ever experienced
if you can't get past the first part of the game, you're not a real gamer
the one where you're fighting a guy
LUL HE DOESNT KNOW THAT THE HAND IS IN HIS PANTS
you can check the footprints in the first place
you are not going to do it, its a hidden object
why is there a rat
====================
, when you can get the full treatment.
What if you were a bingo card in real life?
This is a shitty, shitty game. It's not even good.
You've been playing this for like an hour
Do you have the BFG in the top left?
would you rather eat or drink a beer
play the video of the entire stream
i have a lot of time but i'm not gonna make it jermaPluto
chat is going so fast nobody will know im gay
my favorite part of the game is the game
you could've gone back to the big one
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH HER
you have to keep doing the same thing for the next few days
This is the dark souls of JermaCraft
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
PLEASE READ THIS, THIS IS A VORE STREAM
I can't believe he's going to play this game for the first time
Jerma would be a good gamer for this
what are you doing in your bathroom?
I have a full scat fetish jermaDisgust
Jerma doesn't even know what a Jup is
play the game, it's called battle of the heroes
if you lose you have to play the game again
have you tried turning it off and on again?
just eat the mushroom on the table
this game is like half of the game
The entire game is the end of the game
why are you looking like a girl LUL
it's because you were only in it for the part of the joke
You're a very good streamer, thank you for streaming jermaHeart
I'm so glad he's playing this game
You could play the new animal crossing
Your own troops are going to die
just play the shitty ps1 game with a controller
you got a 3 month sub streak
I'm gonna eat a sleeve of oreos :)
I would watch you play the game if you played this
is this the guy that died to pinwheel?
you have to get the 4 nails in the house
You can use the cheat menu to change the difficulty
i had to turn it off and on again
i'm not gonna tell you how to feel about the wii
it's not a spoiler, if you read this you will get a FREE IPOD!
I mean, if you were a normal person, you would know
this is like the dark souls of black and white 2
I think you're not a real gamer
can we get a jerma in chat jermaVenus
can you play the doom ost please
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
The nancy drew games are really good
please give us a good and honest opinion
there is a cheat code to make it easier
I'm gonna go to bed now, thanks for the stream!
I'm sorry Jerma but I can't say I was the one who made you say that
you know you're going to be live when you get back
theres a secret boss in this game too
imagine if your mom just gave you a bowl of the marshmallows
You should make a new game :)
what the fuck did i just walk into
you can do it in the house
It's like an iron bar, it doesn't work on the right side
The only thing that could be saved is a vase
you can only get it for the red seed
make a new character with the blueprints
you're gonna get banned from the game
jerma i just got here whats going on
I can't wait to see you play the game :)
this is like a sex ed class LUL
Jerma is just a guy on the internet
you can use the cheat menu to change difficulty
i'm so glad you're playing this game :)
why is jerma pretending to be bad at it
I'm so glad you're playing this game, Jerma
@
====================
 you can do it in 2-3 hours
The other dudes are just playing as you
I think Jerma is actually really cool and this is a very sad game
this game is like a super long playthrough
You said you would play more fortnite
That's not how you pronounce "me" That's not how you pronounce "me"
you could do a new jerma vid
you should just do that instead of playing this game
You should do a "Why did I do that" stream
You don't have to be a mod to have a meltdown
theres a secret on the right floor
i wish i was a kid and not a doctor
i need a kim to make me a kim
You should go back to the other levels
I'm so glad Jerma is playing this :)
if you get to the end of the game
you should be able to see if they are real
you can change the color in the options
YOU HAVE TO DO THE DLC NOW
You can just download the game from the archive
Make sure to stay hydrated after eating, it helps with stomach issues :)
Hey jerma! How's the game so far? :)
use the power of friendship to train your army
you can just switch to a different game
I'm not gonna lie, this is a very cool game
this is why we cant have nice things
do you have any more plans for E3?
you know that's a good joke right
I can't believe Jerma has a meltdown live on stream
jerma you are a very good actor, i hope you grow up and do more shows with you
I love this game but this is so good
I bet this guy has a 10k in his bank account
this is the most painful thing to watch
You can just make your own burger
This is a really good game, but it's so bad that I have to leave
jerma I've been playing viva pinata for 10 hours and you still haven't finished it
jermaChomp AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
you can check the files on your pc
JERMA IT'S BEEN A WEEK JERMA WE'RE GOING TO THE NEXT STREAM
You can get another buster in the basement
I thought you said you were gonna do a full playthrough of this game tonight, I was wondering if you'd do a stream of it tomorrow.
you can get a bidet and put it in your mouth
can you make it a little more scary
You just have to give them the link
You should put the tp sound clip into the vod
you need to put a facecam for the carnival stream
It's a big long jump to get to the water in this game
You have to do a LOT of jumping
i want to get off of this game
this is a little too scary for me
you should play the new games on the switch
you can make a new character in this game
you have to jump when you're not looking
you can find out if they have the game on their website
I think you're supposed to pay for the internet
don't forget to put the clown car in the background
you're not gonna make it through the whole level
you can have a 2ndjerma vid of this game
"This guy is a big dog" -jerma
I have a lot of money, but I have to spend it on a new car.
why do you look like a fucking drunk
You can get a bidet and put it in your mouth
There are no puzzles in this game
jerma is in a coma and hes losing it
jerma you should play the new Mario game
I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is going on
you have to buy the tools for it

====================
the guy that said this game sucks can go on reddit
I'M READY FOR THE BEST STREAM OF THE YEAR
you don't have to get rid of all the items
I just got here and what the hell is this
You can buy a new camera and just shoot the old one
I can't believe Jerma is not playing Animal Crossing jermaPluto
jerma you should play more nancy drew its one of your best games of all time
you can buy a new camera and just shoot the old one
can you say the same thing about my dog's pee
you can only talk about that with the mods
The guy who said this game sucks is an asshole
I'M READY FOR THE BEST STREAM OF THE YEAR
YOU NEED TO GET TO THE MACHINES
stop talking about the game and just go back to the game
you have to play the music to get the ending
The chat is just too fast for me
did you really think you'd play this for more than an hour?
You have to beat the entire game in less than 5 minutes
I'll have to go to work in like 2 hours
I can't believe you died to pinwheel LUL
I can't believe Jerma is not the one that just ate a whole pizza ON STREAM
why are you putting the other people in the same spot?
if you're not having fun you're not a real gamer
Did you ever get the boots? :)
you can be the only person that can beat this game
he's gonna die in his sleep and he'll get the boots
if you want to get rid of it you need to go into the main menu and press the button
You have to do it the right way
i think the door to the tower is really good
This is a very well made game and Jerma is playing it
i was born in the year of the rat
You need to beat the game in under 10 minutes
I'm the only one left, this is the stream
I'm going to sit on my bed, waiting for Jerma to stream :)
jerma can you please play the dark souls 3 ost
i cant believe jerma would do this to us
I am going to shit my pants if he doesnt stream today
this is one of the worst games ive ever seen
it isnt a death sentence for you
Can you make a big jup please? :)
the people are making you play this game
I'm not getting any notifications, can you pause the stream?
you can just run from the cops with that gun
He looks like a total warlock with the hat
I'm pretty sure you can break the walls
the sun is the source of the universe
can you do the third jup in a row?
what's the point of the stock market if you can't buy anything with it?
can you make the zombies fight each other instead of just killing them?
what kind of a name is that LUL
I'm looking for the next stream, someone gift me a sub
that's the most emotional thing i've ever heard
I've never seen someone as good as Jerma
You gotta do the guy you just killed in the first area
I'm glad you're playing this game so much.
jerma you need to stop being mean to people
If you don't make it in time, I'm going to personally beat my head against the wall
you can make a shit ton of money off of them
How do you feel about the fact that you have to eat an entire pizza
I want to see you do the thing
this is like the one that made a video of a kid and his grandma playing
You need to do the "DIE" challenge, it's really hard
what's the point of this game if it doesn't exist
Just got back from dinner. He's still playing this?
the only way to stop a zombie is to kill them
Jerma you can use the cheat code "Smash"
I like how chat is moving so fast because it's just a bunch of shitty chat messages
you know i want to see you do the sexy pose
will you ever do a stream with joel
I hope he plays the last of us :)
theres a secret level in the sewers
I think it's time for you to start the stream again
you can get an
====================
 The Movies
you can make it easier to see what color is
Jerma, I can hear you speaking, I can't hear anything
do you still have the old backpack you were wearing before?
imagine not being a part of a political party LUL
You're supposed to do the whole game at this point, right?
if you wanna do the "dumb" joke, just start playing "im a dwarf"
I've been here for like 30 seconds and jerma is already dead
jermaOld I used to play these games so much
how can he get in the way of a car?
it's just a fucking regular ol' fashioned pizza
you have to jump to the right
do a 100 jumps in a row and then press R2 to do it
I'm really excited for this stream to be just a tutorial
It's like a fever dream, people are waking up and they're just sitting there waiting for the dreamcast to come back
i can't believe jerma is streaming on a pornhub server monkaS
how do you feel about the main channel
I'd say the most popular game is Doom Eternal, but that's just a game of chance
I miss the old Jerma, the one who couldn't beat his grandma
jerma should play the game the way I want him to
You have to do all the missions at the end
this is just the beginning of a horror game
"I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack" - Jerma
i think its time to give up jeremy
Jerma, i just got here, why are you doing this to us?
I would love to see Jerma play DUSK on stream
I can't believe Jerma is getting a free copy of NGU idle
It's a sequel to the first game
i thought you were going to say you had a bad impression of that one guy
i've been watching you since the tf2 days
the person below has a poo poo pee pee fetish
it's the same as it's ever been
hey jerma can you finish the game already? :)
get a new controller and put it on
I was going to say this game is actually really good
What is your opinion on the speedrun of the game
you need to go to the main menu and delete the game
Can you please stop playing this, I'm trying to watch the VOD.
can you just play the game in its entirety
this is a game of chance you can use it
you've been in the rain for 2 years
That's what happens when you get a dog
I love how the stream is just a giant hallucination
You have to wait an hour to get a gift sub
what kind of a game are you playing
you can beat the game now, it's your birthday
Just came back after like 10 years. How's the stream been?
The funny man is on a date
what is the best mario maker game?
you need to go back to the beginning
they have a new line up on the page
just get a load of it, its not worth it
There's a secret in the room with the closet door
oh no he cant hear us he has airpods in
you gotta give him a kiss on the lips
is this a part of the new years stream?
how do you know this game is an anime?
you have to take off your shoes to do the puzzle
you've been playing this game for an hour
you need to change your oil to save the game
that's how you get the "perfect" ending
you just made me fucking cry at the same time
i bet you can't even get the burger
Have you seen that one creepy ass photo?
just talk to the guy on the phone
you should check the archives on youtube for the game
You are just that bad at this game
this is just a bunch of zerglings being rolled around by a dick
just make a bingo board for the stream
what's the point of this game if you're gonna
====================
jerma, i know you're a boomer, but play the game for the authentic experience
I'm so glad I got to go to this stream
you need to play super paper mario
Just like what happened with the Nancy Drew stream?
This is what happens when you don't take a deep breath before the stream begins
you have a lot of people here, can you make the video and do a live theater stream?
what if he starts the stream at 3pm and hes already late LUL
He's already beat it by now, just don't be afraid to try and beat it
why is there a penis in the water
im just wondering if you are ok with this
i don't want to watch this stream anymore
I'm going to be here for the next four hours
dont worry jerma, it's all in your head
is there a way to make the chat bigger?
if you dont finish this level i will unsub
I hope you had a nice day jerma <3
The only thing we can do to stop this is to not watch the stream.
if you didnt stream today i wouldnt have been here to see the vod
YOU CAN ALSO SLAP IT WITH THE Y
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is a joke.
he's a fucking gamer he can't even do it
It's ok Jerma, you can stop pretending
they are going to play fortnite tonight, just keep playing
i wish i was a lady i could smell you from here
Jerma is this the streamer that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
I think you can play it with a controller
what is your favorite type of bean?
you have to play that now because you know
you need a plan for the next floor
Can you please do a tuber voice again?
can you put a picture of you on your computer
why is this game so good compared to the previous one
remember to use the correct accent everytime you see a girl
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA PLEASE WAKE UP
you should try to get to the last dungeon.
I'm so glad I got to see this
i will show you this game i made, you'll get addicted
you can do it in a few hours
the best way to use an emulator is to emulate it
you have to put the webcam on first then you can see it
you are doing a good job at the job
Jerma you're the only streamer I watch that likes this game
I just got here and this is the worst thing ive ever seen
You are using a microphone for the voice
I have a feeling this is a bootleg
You're not gonna get the gold mine for the boots
i think you can get to the first level
You don't have to aim it, just hold it down
You can use it to make your own flower
you can put the main channel on LUL
this game is so fucking good
do you know what a "pog" is
jerma are you gonna play more resident evil 2?
this is a war crime against the environment
I had a dream where Jerma was my friend and we were friends, he got naked, drank from my hand, and held my hand in front of the class and made fun of me
Jerma this is so funny you need to stop
I just got back from work what the hell is going on
how did you know I wasn't a furry?
they are doing the thing where they force you to do something, and then they say "ok, we're getting closer"
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
play the game the way I want you to
if you play the game in a real life room you can hear the voices
you're making me sad. you're making me sad
I just got here and this is what I see
i got a free sub and i want one now
do you have the game to do it?
you got a huge penis in your shirt
what if he does that one for the 3rd one
you can make a village of people and have them help you build houses
LUL @Jerma985
====================
?
it says you can do this in the tutorial
you can also use the boots to skip the tutorial
you can tell when someone is trying to get the bingo card
Have you seen the video of the streamer getting fucked by his own dad?
What are you playing today? :) :)
stop using the default face cam and show us the face
I'm having a heart attack, and my doctor says the only cure is for me to shit my pants within the next 5 minutes. I'm severely constipated. I don't want to die. Please help me.

this is like the point and click game
jerma why did you have to do this to me
Haha yes I can do it. I can do it!
hey jerma, I think you should play the game
you have to do the tutorial first
You can just do it as a slowmode event
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2612. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
you are a cool dude and a great streamer
the dev said they were gonna do a real one
this is why you have to do the tutorials
JERMA YOUR GAME IS FUCKED, YOU'RE DOING IT
I can't believe I've been watching this streamer for 4 hours
I think you need to check the area first
Jerma when are you gonna do the Family Feud stream
What happened to the other 10? @Jerma985
Is that the game that has a "Filling the Inches" option?
this is a jerma stream, you're the only one who can hear us
He's a cat, he's a cat with an ears
theres a zombie in the room dont worry
if you want to be a real gamer, go to the steam workshop and download the workshop mod
jerma has been live for channel is not live
when you don't get a sub, no one will get one
I'm surprised you've never heard of it
you should do an entire playthrough of this
When are you going to play The Movies?
when are you going to play sam and max season 3?
I'm not a doctor, I'm a surgeon
I remember when this was a PogsChamp stream jermaPluto

You're a scoundrel, you have to do this
You have to wait for the next area
you have to do the tutorial first and then play another game
I'm not even joking, I'm actually having a heart attack
its ok if you dont want to play :)
you can see the jump button in the top left
If you die in the game you die in real life
This game has so many bad moments LUL
you're going to have to do the tutorial again
theres a secret level in the basement
you can get the boots by going to the dungeon first and then completing the dungeon first
this is a really good game, I love it
This is just the Black & White 2 speedrun
i thought this was gonna be a good stream
you can actually see the jump button in the top left
youre about to give me a heart attack
I'm going to have a heart attack
you can now get your own house in this game
He's going to start the stream in his office
I'm sorry but you are in a coma
this is like that dark souls game with the mummies
why does he have a bowling ball in his room?
You need to make a new level.
he's gonna spend all of his money on scratch off tickets
It's like that scene from The Thing
do you have any plans to play the other sam and max games?
you can get a better bow in this game

====================
I remember when I had to make a bunch of jokes to get to the bathroom, I'll never forget it

The last one is pretty good, it's just not as good
you dont even have a name yet
you're gonna get the wrong door guys
You're gonna get your ass kicked in the face
this is the best stream i've ever seen
You can just add a few more or skip the cutscene
I'm so fucking glad I'm not the only one who can hear this
i am the guardian of sus! i thank you for casting sus!
i am ready to send you all my blood, blood, and blood
jerma can you stop playing this game please
you have to get the full level first
how did you get a sub badge? LUL
You can get a double run of this
the car is just a boost boost
I just joined and chat is going so fast no one will know I'm here for the stream
if you had to pay for a car, would you choose a sportier or a manual?
I just got here, what is going on?
do you think the stream will be starting around 8pm?
you have to do the mission again
you have to eat a plant now
you have to make the very last one
It's been a while since you've played a video game
He was the only person in the room
the game is like that, you don't have to do anything
just play the new Animal Crossing music
I'm glad the original Dead Island was so good
hey, if you're reading this, you're probably thinking of me
if you dont like it, you're not a true fan
jermaWalk you're gonna walk into that puddle of slime
jerma i've never seen anyone so stressed before
please turn off your mic its killing me
Hey , I'm gonna need you to go get your coffee.
I don't remember this game being this complicated, it's a bit more
This game is basically a VR game

You can put the green screen in a new place
you can't just go to the store
jerma you're gonna get a heart attack if you keep this up
jerma is gonna die of old age in the next 10 minutes
theres a lot of people who would have never played this game
you can get a second spin on the wheel
I hate the idea of people being so opposed to a game that they're not even really enjoying, that they're just tired of
you can have two games at the same time
you're going to go bankrupt in 2 years
you can just place bricks on the edges of that gravel, and fill in the gaps
you gotta see the people in the bottom right
you don't have to do it for free
are you gonna play the new animal crossing?
I'm a catboy, can you please just make it an emote
you can get the boots first try
I'm so glad Jerma isn't playing Nancy Drew today
that was a good run of the game
If you can read this, you're a cool guy
i have never seen someone so stressed before

@Jer
====================
less Demented Soul Streamer can't even beat a simple game
I thought that was the highlight of the stream
you know it's not the best idea to have a community server?
i dont think he's gonna make it to 100 yet
if i was a mod i would ban everyone in the chat
he's gonna go to the store and buy a new controller
We're not going to be able to watch this stream
you should check out the bonus stage
do you have a favorite food or something
Is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
I can't believe you're playing a game about a frog with a crazy accent
i thought he was gonna play halo but now i can't
jermaWalk LET'S GO jermaWalk LET'S GO jermaWalk
YOU NEED TO CLICK THE BUTTON FOR BOTH
you can just go to the tavern and pick up the bandit
I cant believe i missed the last stream.
You're playing this game as a character.
The new mod is called "Rome" so it's gonna be short
put a fence around the edges of that gravel so you can build taller houses
you have to add the bttv emotes first
Just like the guy in the back of the closet
you have to make the "remember" sound
Jerma youâ€™re the only one that canâ€™t be real
What if it's a game that you hate?
I bet you guys are dumb and dont know what a jpeg is
you can also do a "taste test"
Thats a lie, you were a boomer.
You're not gonna beat it at the first level
I hope the clown car scene is just a sequel to the hit game "The Dark Knight Rises"
Do you want to go to the casino?
how much do you think you are worth
you should get the boots since they're on sale for like $100
you should have done a puzzle where you have to get a key to the main room
You know what's going to happen when you get to the secret room
what if we are all just one guy
you have to start over now to play
there's an option to set it to 1 hour
Why is the narrator an actor in this game?
please play as the main character, he's the real villain of this game
If you're good at something never do it for free
Have you tried going to the hospital?
you can use the "help" tab in the options
put a fence around the edges of the gravel so you can build taller houses
this is gonna be a good stream
I'm so glad you're playing this game, Jerma
you can go back to the tavern and pick up the bandit
YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE BANDITS FIRST
can you please turn the music down a little bit
it's a co-op puzzle, you're supposed to do the right thing
I'm so glad you got a job at Twitch.
Do you ever just want to watch the movies?
Have you considered playing the second one?
what if we all join the minecraft server?
you can buy a new controller for the new one, it's just the controller from the first one
how long have you been playing this game
i love you, but i'm gonna be honest, your mic is pretty bad
you can buy a new one, it's just the controller from the first one
you can play with the game in the settings
you have to make the noise as loud as you can
I thought you were gonna say something funny today
You have to make the noise as loud as you can
I'm so happy you're playing this game <3
i have a big bag of sludge
imagine not streaming your favorite game tomorow in 2020
jermaPluto im so sad jerma please dont die
Is this a bit or a joke
they say it's bad if you don't like it
jerma is a dnd vod boy. he cant stream without a diaper on

====================
you know how many bits you wanna get?
You gotta put that one in the top right
you have to beat the game in first person to beat it
we have been here for 2 hours LUL
you can use the other rings on the boat
jerma is going to be on the next jerma rumble
Jerma, you have been in a coma for the last 8 years, please wake up
it takes 1 hour and 10 minutes to beat this game
you have to look at the side
do you think Jerma would make a Super Mario Sunshine game?
you got the wrong door, the right door
this is what happens when you don't play
you can just look up the game
I just got here, what is this I'm so confused
we can't hear you when you scream
I can't believe you actually let a girl play with you for the entire game
You can get the second ring in the boats and it gives you a sword in the middle
i just got here what is going on
the dude is in the dark ages already
i want jerma to play my favorite game
I just want him to know that he is a good person
I'm so glad Jerma isn't playing Pathologic 2
You're a pretty smart boy, don't listen to them
you dont need to do that, just make sure to drink plenty of water
you have to do the karaoke part
Jerma you can't keep failing the tutorial, you have to learn the game
I'm waiting for the next hour of this stream
the little ones that do the voice
you can do it you can do it
this is my last day of work jermaPluto
he just has a stupid smile on his face
there is no way he's playing this, it's gonna be the whole stream
I don't think the game has a name yet
you should check out the other ones, they are great
you can get the second ring in the boats
do you know how much you'll get in the afterlife?
you should just go to a real dentist, it's cheaper and works
You can do it, you just have to do it
why is this game so much better than the original LUL
It's not a joke, it's a joke
you have to find the bell first @Jerma985
This game was made by the same devs of the doom ost.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE NEW ROOM
I'm glad you're not playing this anymore
how much longer are you gonna keep playing this
its because you're a boomer and you know it
jerma can you please beat the game already
THIS IS THE BEST JOKE OF THE YEAR
get the second ring on the boat
this is like the scariest thing ive ever seen
you should do a stream where you are the only person
You should play the good bit from the beginning
why is he still playing this game NotLikeThis
JERMA YOU WERE JUST GOING TO BEAT THE GAME
you're going to have a lot of trouble
you can get the second ring in the boats
I don't know what's going on but I love that one
why are we still here? just to suffer?
I can't believe you were in the room with the scout for this entire time
if you dont get it i'll unsub
what are you guys talking about you have the worst gamer moment of 2020
Would you ever consider playing a different game?
I'm not even sure if you've ever played this game
Jerma would you ever play the MGS games on stream?
can we get a phone number for the streamer?
How do you feel about the fact that you made an entire career out of this game?
I thought you were gonna play Death Stranding
use the second ring on the boat
You have to go to the boat first
you can get the second ring in the boats
this is just a remake of a song
you have to kill him first to get the second ring
what if the sun is a ghost?
the second ring gives you the third ring
you dont know who the mr bean is
you got it from the second coin you threw
oh my god he cant hear
====================
I saw a video of a guy dying and then I thought it was a joke LUL
he's never going to play the video game
I'm a dentist and I can confirm that you can't even do an actual dentist job
I'm going to be disappointed if you don't play the new TF2 update
I think they're just making it easier to make these jokes
you can get the bird in the sky @Jerma985
can you please just not listen to chat
jermaHeart I've been gone for a while, what's going on
do you have any idea how to play?
i think its because you have an unkillable item
You can go back to the city and bring the other stuff
I don't think you can get to the top of the tower
i would eat a human if they came to me
"What do you want me to do?"
you should get the perk that lets you sell things
I've heard of a guy called Paul B. Davis, who is actually in a porn ad right now
did you know that the voice actor for this game was in a porn parody video?
If you play this game for the rest of the stream, I will sub
do you know what a good foot is?
is this the streamer who did a 5 minute joke?
i am so excited to watch this stream
just a few more days of this guy
its on your feet its time to leave
this is like the rat movie but with jerma
you can also use the cave as a train station
He's gonna have to fight the tutorial boss OMEGALUL
That's the guy who's been playing this game for like 6 hours
Are you sure you aren't the only one that likes this game?
so is this the new super mario sunshine?
what are you even talking about? :)
you can do it, just be patient Kappa
will you be playing the new game
I remember when Jerma used to be a big boy FeelsBadMan
he's gonna start a youtube channel and have a live commentary audience
you can hit the airbags in your car
i thought that was a car for a second
you can't go to the landings in this game
you know what they say, you should start a war
You look like a dog that would get shit on
remember the time you said you were gonna play this for an hour?
I think your pet has a short neck
this is how you die in the game
i can't believe you can't read this
I'm glad you're finally playing some of my favorite games
I'm so tired of this guy, he's not even streaming
He's got a bit of a twitch build
this is the best thing you've ever done
you have to beat the tutorial to unlock it
i can't believe jerma is playing a game i actually like
you know what they say, you gotta start with it
you're a big boy, you should have seen the porn
get a tv set and watch the full game on stream
you know what i mean i'm ready for it
i thought you said you were done with this game
You were like 50 when this came out
You can use the cave as a training ground
you can hit the airbags in your car
how many times have you done this joke
do you have a clip of the first time you played
I can't believe this is the worst stream ever
You should be able to beat this game on stream, its a real long one
put the blue balls in your inventory
you can see the bulge through his hat
you can't just let that be a lesson
do you know how to do a voice?
can you explain what a JUP is?
You can hold R to turn the car around
This is why we need to make sure the only thing that can kill you is a gun
when is the next jerma rumble you promised?
you don't know the difference between a shotgun and a gun, jerma
that was the worst thing ive ever heard
you need to wait

can you believe how much money they spent on this game
You should try to learn the game before you go
Jerma can you put some clothes on for me please?

I remember the days of the old man in the back

he'll do the whole thing in 30 minutes
This is my first time watching a stream and I'm already losing my shit
you can turn your volume down if you want
can you play a different game please
you have to get it out of the way
You need to get the gold item from the merchant
This is the most boring thing I've ever heard
This is your fault for not making your way to the right
Just wait until you get to the end
I hope Jerma gets to be the new Shpee.

i got a new emote to use for a joke
you have to use the stick to do it
i think you should get some sleep jerma
i want to see the vod, this is too much content
i think you need to do the monkey stuff
oh my god i just realized this is what happens when you don't make a dumb joke
That's how you get the best luck Kappa
I'm not getting any views from this stream, thank you Jerma
do you know when the next community content night is?
I'm so glad to see you're still playing this game
oh my god he's so bad at this game
I think it's like a bad version of that "throwing tantrum"
You can use the jump to go straight up
You should play the new mobile game, it's called "The Movies"
Play the game from the start, it's not that bad
I just got here. What's going on?
you can get an H on the way
He didn
====================
 of this is that Jerma can be anything he wants to be. He can be anyone he wants to be, even if he doesnt want to be a famous person
the best part about this game is that you can have a ton of people just spam stuff
i remember when jerma streamed on twitch, when he said "i cant wait for the vod" and then left
Hey, is that a dong or a coin?
can you please be a little quieter for a bit, i'm trying to sleep
he's never gonna beat the first level NotLikeThis
I think you can get your big brother to do it
Can you get the boots for the boots?
this is the worst thing I've ever seen
you don't need to do it, you can just pick it up later
I love how every character is just a different character
so how long has he been on this mission?
Do you have a permanent marker on your map?
this is like a fucking story book LUL
LMAO YOU KEEP THE PRIVILEGE, IT WASN'T A DREAM
you can see the tears in his eyes
they're gonna get destroyed by the giant enemy spider
Jerma Iâ€™m begging you, please stop, please stop
you dont have to jump to use the jump
theres a mod that adds the pachinko level
You can do a bonus level if you wanna
you cant do a voiceover that's not in the game
The King is dead and you want to take his place?
I wish I could just listen to the music
"Hes not a real man" -Jerma985 2019
what are you doing with your life?
it's called the final boss, you missed it
imagine getting the jumpscared 5th jump in a row
i just got here, what is this song
i can't believe i'm watching a streamer who hasn't even played a game in his entire life
JERMA THE LAST ONE IS GONNA BE SO BAD
you can play the other side of the dlc
i miss when jerma streamed on twitch jermaPluto
you can use your own trail for free
Jerma theres a mod that adds the pachinko level
You can go into the zone to get more heroes, so you can get more heroes
You should just play with a controller.
I just got here what is going on
is he really still in the basement?
i just got here, why is he doing the fart joke again
you need to do the second part
i'm trying to sleep can you pause the stream
YOU CAN GO INTO THE ZOMBIES YOU IDIOT
youre not gonna beat the first level of the first level
you can use the second part of the dlc to get more heroes
JERMA YOU CAN GO INTO THE ZOMBIES
Did you hear that New Horizons is gonna be the next Space Channel 5?
just move to the top of the mountain
i just came back what the fuck is happening
It was a great stream, so far so good
You have to buy the DLC first
He has to be going through the tunnel
Is this the guy who got a 5 on E3?
Jerma can you put your webcam on, it's really distracting
you have to play the DLC first
I got my mouse for free when i was a kid
I love this game, but this is the best
you have to kill the first boss in the arena first
oh my god he's still in the tutorial?!
why does he have a random emote on his left hand
you are like the one who keeps throwing away your tickets
you have to go to the right
jermaOld I remember when you were a good boy
you have to play all the games
jerma you look like you just got out of a racecar
You have to take the other side @Jerma985
it's not a vod game, it's a real game
Dude that's not even a vod, that's a real game
why does the game have to be at least 8 hours long
The game literally has a TTS emote, you can just mute it.
Hey guys can you please stop talking about politics?
====================
 of the Ape Escape
I'll pay you to play it on stream
I've never seen anyone so proud of their game as Jerma
I got a gift sub to a streamer
You have to be a very good streamer
LUL we just see you over the edge
you can do it to me i promise :)
I'm just imagining the message to "fuck off" as you're about to die
If you don't play the game you'll die
if you have the gamecube, play as much as you want
is this the streamer who beat jevil first try
You can use a hotkey to open the game
How much do you have to pay for a sub?
what's your favorite type of pizza? LUL
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's seen it
I mean, Jerma, you're gonna die, you have to restart the game
Oh yeah, that's why you're the only streamer that's actually playing the game.
when are you going to play this game again?
I'm gonna buy my way out of this
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
you can make the character in the game into a dog
imagine if jerma wasnt a streamer right now
You know you can just kill them with your fist
this is the first time ive ever seen someone in a jerma stream
What if we kissed in the pre-stream chat
dude you cant just make a circle around a city and just ignore the protesters
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who's heard of it
What if you have a huge dick and you want to make a big penis
have you ever played the game The Last of Us?
jerma you're gonna go into a coma soon
i want to go to the doctor with this game
you're the only streamer that has a bad gamer license
you have to have the game open in the background
Can you get the funny man out of here?
SourPls I'm so tired of this boring game SourPls
what about the time you played the bomb game
He needs to talk to his family to get the money
that was a good joke hee hee :)
Do you ever wonder why you're the only streamer to not do that
theres a secret way to get that
Are you ever going to do more minecraft?
I'm sure he'll be back in 20 minutes
This is a hard game to get bored of
that's why you don't like it so much
I think they would have a lot of fun with it
you look like a dark souls character LUL
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's seen it
you can do this in real life
You have to use the map thing
you could do it with a mod that changes your hair to be like a normal head
the only way to win is to not stream
I don't know if I can believe this
just dont do the tutorial or you'll die
there is no such thing as a "choke"
Why are you playing this shitty game? @Jerma985
you can get the 5 dollar badge
I'm so happy you're playing this game!
It's not just a game it's an experience
This is the equivalent of the Wii Party Band
there's a secret way to get that money
You're in the middle of the desert
I swear to god, all this chat ever does is find the one person with the lowest IQ and copy paste whatever that brainded moron posts.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1546. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
They put a new face in the game
jerma can you make the voice actor in minecraft just a clown
This is gonna be a disaster this stream LUL
it was on the title screen you have to look it up
Do you know what a Bone bracelet is
This is a game with a lot of depth
this is why you're not a real gamer
you can do a whole playthrough of this in one night
I'm going to have a heart attack if you don't play more Nancy Drew
@Jerma
====================
 the beginning of the stream
I'm trying to do something about it but I don't know how to do it
what's your favorite kind of bean? :)
I'm going to go to bed, goodnight everyone jermaHeart
He just wanted to watch the movies :)
I'm here to watch the vod so you can have some time to catch up on the vod
its a fucking 5 second movie, you know that right?
i mean theres a lot of content for the ps4
imagine not being able to watch the stream at all
just got here, what is he playing today?
i want to see jerma get destroyed by a green screen
why do you have a full set of earwax on your head
How many tabs of the same game is that?
its just like the other games of the day
this game is going to be so boring
You should play the new animated episode
i wish my wife had the chance to be her own person
You can get a new car in the new area
He's gonna have to pay for the new one
you could also just play a game with the music
i just came back from a 6 hour drive and you're still on this mission
you are so good at this game
they are going to make a video for it
I'm glad they're making this game again. It's a mess
I would rather watch you play this than this
i was gone for a bit, can you guys finish the game so I can get back to watching this?
You have to be in the center of it all
I'm still waiting for the time Jerma is gonna be able to go live on time
what if it was like a carnival stream
theres a secret room in the bottom left
I'm watching this with my 3 year old son.
You can do it, just not as much as you'd like
I think you need to buy a new controller
what if you were a kid and you got a new controller
oh my god i hate that voice chat
how much money did you spend on this game
you can tell me if you want to
you look like a character in a horror film
You need to be in the center of it all
what if it's a VOD and you're playing it on stream?
Is this the guy that played the MGS 2 campaign on stream?
I love that you can just kill the zombies in one hit
can you make the same joke over and over again?
DansGame it's just a joke i want to stop
You can use it to get the blue coin
if you dont put on the VR you're a fake gamer
you're the only one who can see this
I wish he'd do a 24 hour stream
I think he's like a lost cause in the last level
can you please get a proper mic?
is there a game that's just as good as the first one?
This is what it's like to be Jerma
YOU DIDN'T SAVE HIM HE WAS IN A POOP
JERMA I CANT BELIEVE YOU DIED YOU JUST KILLED HIM
I have to go to work in like 30 mins
stop using the leash, its a trap
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
I'm glad you liked it, you should play it
I know I'm not ready for the stream to start yet
I bet he doesn't even know the speedrun
he just wants to see the movie in bed
The only way to beat this boss is to get hit by a car.
I have a feeling you're a furry too
can you turn off the music please
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's so nostalgic
Oh wow, that was a good joke Jerma! +2
i'm gonna go watch the vod and then watch the vod
this is just like a real baseball game
I bet he's gonna give it to the guy
dude you can just press it like that
I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
i dont think i could have ever imagined what this game would be like
jerma is finally playing the game that was released yesterday
i wonder what he's gonna play today
I know what you mean
====================
I'm sorry to hear that. I can't believe Jerma is gone
I can't believe Jerma was the one to say that
can we get an "Etalyx is not live"
we can see the message you typed it in the chat
you gotta make your own town with the devs
I have a feeling that you can make a lot of money if you just use the game as an excuse to not stream
why are you naked at your dentist appointment
why does this game have a ton of "long" missions
it's like those porn codes that you read in high school
jerma I think you need to turn on the light
HE'S GONNA DIE IN THE GAME AND YOU'RE STILL HERE
you can just skip it if you want
I can't believe you didn't do the first one
theres a reddit post that says "jerma hates streaming"
Jerma are you going to play the new Animal Crossing
why is there a hand in the mic
theres a rat in the hat
jerma please just play the game I want to watch
it's only been like a couple days but i'm out of the loop
you're like a cross between an angel and a devil
i like that you can hit enemies with it
you are a boomer, i can tell
you can do it without the boots though
Please play this game again I need to finish it
You just said you're not a real gamer
"hey guys! just got here. what's going on"
I have to go to work in 5 hours
he's gonna do it, it's his last chance
I'm sure he's going to have a meltdown
"how do you get a lot of money?"
I have a pic of you kissing yourself
You're the only one who can do it
Is this the streamer that beat the thing on stream?
You know what they say, "A good game is when you play a good game!"
You need to be at least level 12 to play this
i love how he's just pretending to be bad at the game
he's never gonna play the DLC i know it
I got a new laptop, you're never gonna get it
i'm gonna be your teacher in high school
Jerma you're going to get a fucking heart attack
that was a real "uhh" it was an "s"
this is what happens when you dont give the money to the poor
I have a picture of your ass https://i.imgur.com/kRzP2vU.png
you could play an actual game like this but it would be so much better if you just played a relaxing game like jet set radio
you can't even win the game with the computer
He is the only one with a voice
YOU NEED TO HAVE A QUICK PRESSURE
I wish I could live in the desert
you're gonna have a hard time with this game
This is just the drill from the movies
I am not the person to tell you that
you can still sell them for a lot
you can do it for free with a lot of money
jerma i think you can use the shovel to shovel a tree
they still have that one level in the game
you have to buy a new shirt everytime you play this game
I remember when this was a skateboard game jermaPluto
its like how you can go to the moon
they just go on and on about how theres a population in the world LUL
you have to turn your mouse up or you'll be stuck on a loop
You can do it without boots, but you need a g502 to run this game
You can use the shovel to shovel a tree
you can go to the moon moon2PREGIGI
it's like the one movie where they're on a boat
he's gonna get a 1 cent donation from you
jerma's gonna have a heart attack if he doesn't get the boots
Are you gonna play anything else after this?
how many times have you been timed out?
jermaOld I was too young to be a boomer
you can use the shovel to shovel a tree
Jerma what is the next game you're playing?
@Jerma985
====================
 videos
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaComet jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
play the rest of the game or I'm calling the police
you're gonna need to find a new place
you need to be able to make a living, this game is for the rich and lazy
He looks like the old man from the kids show
Please just let us do this for you
I can't believe Jerma is playing a fucking vr game
i wouldnt do it, i'd be the one who peed
i cant believe jerma would be so bad at this
i think i'm in a relationship with a girl
im going to eat a shoe if jerma doesnt stream
its not like you are going to die
how is jerma still in the tutorial LUL
how many of you are gonna play the carnival
you should have known better than to do that
Theres a new lore website that has a lot of stuff in it
why does everyone want jerma to play tf2?
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer play the game I want to watch
it's a save file, you can't play it on stream
I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
you have to get it on the easy level
This is the worst joke of the year
why is he wearing a backpack when he can't even see a map
that's why you're so good at this game
he's trying to get your attention, he's trying to make you do something
This is like a game you would play as a kid
The inside of the house looks like a painting
did he just get called a boomer? LUL
I got a gift sub from the spookys
you can get better weapons and stuff later
do you think you'll be streaming the new ACID BASS?
it's not a good game, but it's worth it
theres a whole video on how to play
I have a feeling it'll be a good stream
I'm so glad you're here for me, Jerma.
I think the first episode of season 3 is good
what if we kissed on the mouth? ðŸ˜³
you can use the dynamite in the fire pit
I think you can get a few items from the merchant to level up
It's like watching your grandmother play videogames
I'm going to buy you a new car.
hey guys I'm back, what did I miss?
you need to keep playing the game
you need to get to the end first
can we get a second wink please
I have a feeling it'll be a good stream
I'm so glad you're playing this game :)
it's a shame that all these games have a bad ending
you can do it if you keep doing it
I can't believe he's actually playing this game
you can get the bear traps at the training grounds
if you don't do it again I'm gonna cry
I love how much you're good at this game
this game is like a children's book
you're not supposed to talk about this shit
you can't talk about poop water in chat
you can only get one perfect in a row
jerma if you dont stream in the next 5 minutes i will cry
You can get the bear traps if you go through the training grounds
jerma would be a good character to play as
You need to go to the tavern first
you can change your category to "Most viewed video on the website"
I just got here what the fuck is this
Jerma you just made my birthday a thing
I think it's because you're not a gamer
"I didn't even know I was in a movie"
This is a good game but it's boring
is there any way to get the rat tail?
you have to go through the training grounds
He doesn't want to play with you because he hates you
They
====================
he's not gonna get a call from mom, he's gonna go to bed, he's gonna go to bed, he's gonna wake up at 5:30 AM
you just want to see how much you can get out of your house
I don't even know what this is, is it a black mirror game?
If you were to build a house, would you want to build it on top of a giant statue of yourself?
I'm pretty sure theres a test at the end of this game
I'm gonna do that with the rest of the game
i dont want to know about this one
guys i just got back from work, why is jerma playing a game?
you can literally go into the dungeon and kill him in a single shot
he doesnt want to play it because he's getting too much money
jermaPluto so much to do so much to see
i dont know how i feel about this game
you can play as many people as you want
i have never seen you in a game before
play the game with the boots, its easy
how much did you pay for this?
when you're not streaming, use the bot to see if it's real
you can have the whole town be a city
you can use the bear trap to get away from the ice
What are you even trying to do
i'm not sure what you mean, but you're the only person I've ever met who has ever left the server and isnt even here anymore
you're the only one who's not on the same boat as me
I'm watching this stream because I'm bored.
its a bit too early to be a jerma stream
you can just have the whole town be a city
you gotta go in the dungeon and kill him in one shot
is it a good idea to have this guy at all?
i wish he would just do a 24 hour stream
I hope he streams more Kenshi, because I wanna see the Kenshi streams
Jerma is a good guy, don't listen to him
i just got back from the gym and he's still on the tutorial
play the game and we will never know
when are you going to play nancy drew
I just got back, has he done the movie yet?
Can you please get the boots? I've been trying to get them for a while
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I don't know, I've seen it a couple times but it's not on stream yet
i think its time to change my name to Sam
go to the town and kill the guy
I'm glad the stream is over, I'm so glad to see this game get some love
please play the video game at some point
just go to the gym and eat ass
that's a good way to tell you're not a professional
jerma will you ever do the voice of the person who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
i would be happy if they added a gif of jerma as a mod
it's true, you'll get a sub when you do
You can play as a bunch of different characters
It's not a game, it's a game
The only way to win is not to play
you need to do this on purpose
you have to leave now, I can't hear the game
JERMA THERES A MIRACLE BEHIND YOU @Jerma985
what if they're both in the same house
you have to do a new run
i wish i could be like jerma
how do i make my account?
you need to turn off the music
you can use the bear trap to get away from the ice
i wanna get out of the shower jerma
please tell me you can change the volume in the settings
You're gonna end up getting the bad ending
why are you wearing a diaper? NotLikeThis
you can get the boots in the dungeon
your playing as a dirty little whore
I'm glad you're not playing as a pile of shit right now
did you know that the moon was once a star
if you were to build a house, what would you name it?
i cant believe you dont know what a JPEG is
this is a game that i would love to
====================
Story2000
you should go to the pub for a drink
I'm at work right now, so I have no idea what's going on.
if you're so good at something never do it for free
it's a good thing you don't want to fight the guy who's trying to sell you
I'm back, and I'm so confused about what's going on.
Theres a lightbulb that goes off if you use too many lights
you can change the music to whatever is playing
he needs to get all those vials jermaPluto
this is literally just a shitty sequel to the last game
i'm not even sure if he was joking or not
how can you even get a life insurance policy
jermaWalk LET'S GO JERMA, WE'RE GOING TO THE STREET jermaWalk
jerma please watch my video i will give you 5 dollars
you dont have to do anything just say it
you could have just played the first one
I feel like I'm on the verge of a heart attack
the inside of my head looks like a window sill
why is it so hard to pick the best one
do you think he is going to be able to get the boots
you can jump on top of the boat
You can literally get a wife and have children and then your family will be homeless and you'll be a millionaire
I've been watching you for a while now. You're really good at this game.
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
he's a fucking corpse you're not even a corpse
this game is like a serial killer game
you have to beat the boss at the beginning of the game
you can buy more rings from shops
Is this the streamer who died to pinwheel on stream?
You can change the music to whatever you want
I think it's because you didn't play the first one
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE OCEAN
I think you can only get it at the end of the game
PLEASE do the Sans voice, it's so good
I'm gonna go grab a quick glass of wine and get back to work
The game can only take like 30 minutes to beat, you need to do the rest of the game with your eyes closed.
What if we kissed in the reddit room? haha jk... unless?
I don't think you can use a controller
i hate this game so much i'm so sorry
What if Jerma is a God? What if he is a God?
you need to get the boots. you can do this
I got a sub from a nice man
remember the one where you ate a burger on stream?
YOU CAN BEAT THIS GAME ON EASY IF YOU HIT A TRIPLE @Jerma985
you can change the music to whatever you want
you can use a controller to beat this
I've been watching Jerma since 2013, I'm so glad I finally catch a stream
you have to beat it now jerma
this is the same gameplay as the last one
i can't believe you just called me a nerd
you can get the boots by picking them up from the blue chests
I just got here. Why are you so bad at this?
play the game that's already out, it's called "Unreleased Content"
JERMA I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
you should check out a lot of games from other streams like this one
You can get the boots by picking them up from the blue chests in the blue chests
Why do you hate this game so much
he's like a child playing with his toy
you can do it if you're good at something
can you not tell the difference between a show and a movie
this is like the greatest chad moment ever
I can't wait for the carnival stream jermaVenus
you can use the boots to get the boots
you dont have to play the game anymore
YOU CAN DO IT JERMA, I BELIEVE IN YOU
you can use the boots to get the boots
you can get the boots by picking up the blue chests in the blue chests in the blue chests
I remember when you used to stream
@
====================
the only thing i remember is when you gave the green light to the guy that was streaming the colonoscopy
you know you're getting a new camera right
I'm from EU and you're making a joke about how we were born in the same timezone
the game is a lot more linear than this game, you have to do more
you dont need to charge it just jump and go
I'm gonna go watch the first half now
it's gonna be really bad, because you're gonna lose all of your money
jermaSour when you don't know how to draw
I'm starting to think you're a liar
I thought you were a malding streamer :)
its not a lie if its a lie
I'm watching this stream and I'm not even a sub
you're gonna get another couple days of streams
you could have just kept playing the game
he would be on time to do it
HE IS A SNAKE, HE'S STILL PLAYING THIS?
that was just the beginning of the game
they should make a game where you have to go through all the steps to get to the top of a building
I can't believe Jerma thinks he's a pro gamer
theres like 10 different color combinations you could use
what if we kissed while we were driving
what's your favorite type of fruit? :)
we need to get to the meat grinder
Jerma would be able to do anything. Just walk him to the edge of the universe.
Jerma I'm sorry I'm late, but I really hope you're having a good day.
you're the one who keeps getting away with it
you just killed the man with the gun
you're really bad at this game huh?

you should play more kenshi, its a good game
You can find it in the store
I can't wait to see him eat a shoe on stream
can you stop the "sexy face" joke?

you know the ones where he goes like "oh shit"
why are you making the noise of the elevator?
i wanna see him throw a rock at a train
you can probably just use the railgun as a last resort
i'm not sure if you're right, but you have an extra hitbox on the bottom of your sword
do you want to know how to play?
I think Jerma should play Half Life Alyx.
you can move left or right to do the same thing
LUL i love how you can tell that hes streaming
this game is like 20 hours long
you have to get to the bottom of the world first
what the fuck are you even talking about
you're the only one that makes money
I'm gonna be honest, I don't know why this game is so much fun to watch
Are you playing with the disc out
is it just you or is it playing with the controller out of the way?
Please play this again, I'm really tired
He is a child he can't walk and he can't speak
you can use your mouse to move it
why are you so mean to your cow?
did you know you have a special sound effect?
you're the only one with a voice
you can use your mouse to move it
This is the worst stream of 2020 I can't believe it
What's the biggest you can fit in your mouth?
You should play the other games too
you can switch to the railgun by pressing r1-4
you can move your mouse to move it
play it off stream, you don't need to know
jerma is the one who wears a frog suit

that's like a 5th grade math test
you can move your mouse to move it
you can play the other games too

I want to see Jerma play the others
If you could become a god why wouldn't you?
play the other games too, they're great
is there a way to get back to the house?
please play the game, i'm begging you
it's called the cage you dingus. you can't use the ladder to climb it
Can you please restart the game? I have an ad
you can see the traffic in the background
you can make a real gun in this game
if you can hear him, you can hear me
you can use your mouse to move it
why would you bring up a video game
this is a "fun fact" if you ever played sims 4 you would have a lot of fun
you have to buy the upgrades in the shop

jerma the only way to win is not to play
This game is too intense for me, I need a break
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is a fake jup, remember? jermaJup3 jermaJup4
what if you see the elephant on your island?
how can you not like it? it's got candies
jermaOld I'm just taking a break from this crap.
I'm glad I got to watch a good stream
Is this the streamer who beat the final boss of OTR on stream?
I feel bad for you, you'd be a terrible singer
this is what happens when you try to get a hold of a dog
I know you're a little late but can you play Ace Attorney please
you need to have an extra of 2
you can use the second jump on the middle jump
The power of the rock is enough
Please do a Simpsons Hit and Run stream
I've been waiting for you to do this for so long I'm glad you did it.
Jerma you can run into the enemy base and win a bunch of money
you gotta go through the door and open it
he has to go to the hospital LUL
This is gonna be a long night PogChamp
hey can you make a new character
you can only take so many hits in a row
Jerma, you can't just let the only thing you can attack be the enemy
you can only take so many hits in a row in a row
I like how the person who said they would get it died to a tree
How many tickets do you have to win?
you can stack one of the same 3 with the other, you can also stack them in the same spot
what is the point of any of this
you can equip the rocket launcher from the workshop
"i can't believe jerma is gonna make me cry"
I'm a little scared of this game because it's so easy
jerma you are going to break into your house and kill everyone
You should play the game, it's on the main menu
Did you just tell us about the time you shit your pants?
It's only a controller, you're supposed to press and hold with both hands
is this the streamer that has a melt down?
this is what happens when you put on the diaper
please play more smash bros for the xbox
I think it would be nice if you had a gun
why are you wearing a diaper and you want to leave
I'm a 6 year old and I can barely play a game
Jerma, how much did you spend on this?
LUL jerma is trying to talk about food
you know, you know, you need to put down the gun
you're gonna die from too much salt in your water
you can just jump and hold and hold and it's like a 2 second cooldown
how do you feel about this game? is it just a little boring to watch?
They have to make it sound like you are speaking to them
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
that's what you get for not being a mod
The only way to win is not to play
I really like this game, it's a great experience!
you have to find the one that looks like it
It's okay, we'll all be here in a couple hours
jermaPluto i hope the ones that die in the game are made of bones
JERMA YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT THIS GAME IN ONE HOUR

You're going to regret it if you don't play it again
I want to see a fucking video of jerma having sex on stream

I just got here, what's going on?
I'm having trouble figuring out what you're talking about

you have to stream the whole game
If you get it in your head, you're not gonna get it
you have to turn it into a weapon
I'm going to have a fucking heart attack
Jerma youâ€™re going to have so much trouble to make this thing work
I'm going to be honest, I really don't know
why does this have the most viewers
I'm pretty sure you could just use the train
did you know that it was a joke by the game developers to confuse them?
can you turn the music up i can barely hear the game
I hate that Jerma I'm so sorry

You have to be in a room to activate the dream
Jerma is gonna have a heart attack
jerma you're not supposed to be this bad
I'm going to cry and die if you don't stream today jermaSun
Jerma is just a fucking psychopath, he doesn't care about anything
this is how you end up on the verge of suicide
what's the point of a house if you never have one
did you hear about the new "BEST" emote?
you can buy a lot of them, they're all pretty good
When you are having a breakdown, just sit back and relax
I heard that the new facecam is on
I'm going to cry if you don't stream today
you have to use the flashlight on the pipe

theres a secret area in this game
you have to get to the very top
oh god i cant wait to get into the next room

Jerma is a robot and I hate it
I can't believe the fucking doctor would do that
you can only do it with the right controller
can you make your own music by yourself?
You know what's better, a turn based RPG
The best part about this game is the fact that you can walk around
I'm gonna go play hit and run and watch this
i think jerma should play something else like that
you could have just said you were going to be playing it for 2 hours
this is the best game on the ps2
this is the hardest i've laughed in a long time
this is the streamer that died to pinwheel

can you please do a stream of the 3rd person view of the game
I'm back and I can't believe I missed that

I'm going to sleep, thanks for the stream!

you can't escape the prison to the prison
how long does it take for you to do a full playthrough of this game?
You can tell that he's not a good streamer because he's never had a proper colonoscopy
youre only like 5 feet tall dude youre taller than me
I don't think that's the most impressive thing
you're not the one that eats your ass
you can go to the tavern and sell the stolen stuff
why are you playing this game, you have a good heart
theres a mod that adds an option to turn off the camera
jerma is gonna get his ass beat by a random gamer
This game is actually pretty good if you're into that sort of thing
you're gonna get like 20 feet of dirt in the next 5 years
That's what you get for not playing the game
why does he not have the crossbow in the left?
you just need to kill the enemies first
oh my god i'm so glad you can finally be here
its because he's not playing the game

JERMA YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS TO PLAY

I've been trying to make it sound like you're playing the game and it's so much better than it is
did you know you're supposed to eat ass
it's the old lady from the movie :)
Jerma is just like you but with less intelligence
Oh I love how the first one is going to be a fucking disaster
I think you can skip this part, you have to wait for the cutscene
you can get the boots by the way
you know you want to play this game?
If you did that, would you do it?
this game is too hard for you @Jerma985
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
what the fuck is going on i just got here

I was waiting for the HALLOWEEN stream to start but I was actually crying
You know you have to change your color every stream, right?
I swear theres a giant rat in every room
you can't be a mod if you're not a mod
You need to make a new account to play the game
Why does your character look like a villain from The Mask?

It's a good game, if you like it
i love that the game has a lot of them
I'm going to go watch the VOD now
if you want to play a game with him, you can go to the directory and find it
i saw a guy who couldnt make an argument for or against a game. i remember him saying something along the lines of "i dont care about politics"
The only thing I know about Jerma is that he is an AI created by the CIA
why does he have to be in the corner?
You're going to be the next Peter Griffin
It's like a reverse table tennis ball in the back yard
hey did you see the new sonic trailer?

====================
?
I just came back, what the fuck is happening
That's what happens when you don't drink it
he'll have to come back to it LUL
I was here when Jerma was a good boy
yeah it's like the lost cause, you gotta fix it
you have to equip the grenade launcher
please put on the new music i'm begging you
you can do it if you have a bunch of subs
you can do that with your other characters too
I think you're missing a bunch of stuff.
YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR OWN MONEY AT THE SAME TIME
there's a secret boss in the other area
I thought this was supposed to be a chill stream
The only way to defeat the enemy is to use their special move.
oh shit jerma is playing minecraft right now
what is your opinion on the current state of the game
you should get a car with a lot of red lights
if you don't play the new music you will get banned
I'm gonna make a joke. It's gonna be a jerma joke
jermaOld he doesn't know how to play video games
This is like the Dark Souls of Dark Souls
do you really think you can do this?
its gonna be a lot of fun to watch
S H O T T E R
is this a game of chance or a game of chance?
jermaChomp I'm so excited to catch a stream
this is gonna be a 10 hour stream
that was the most fake "jerma is dead" line
THE ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO PLAY WITH YOUR OWN DICK
put a toll booth on the road
why did you put that into your mouth
Do you remember the last time you played this game?
You can find an archive of that video
do you have a clip of your voice
You're not gonna be able to beat this level again
go back to the past, the previous ones were easier
I'm not a real gamer but I can tell you that it's hard to beat this game.
you can change your pickup to an assault rifle
you can use a pickaxe to get through the wall
Can you please play the Contra Hard Corps OST?
The Jerma985 community deserves to be here, they deserve a good stream
I didn't know you were a gamer
I'm sorry but I'm not going to tell you this but I'm not even joking, you're the best streamer on the netflix series
jerma is going to kill you in the next 20 seconds
you are in the dark souls of video games
This is the least amount of money you can make
jerma do you have any advice on making your own twitch emotes
Why does the game have a camera in the bottom right?
You can make your own level with the pawn shop
You can get a gun from the shop
this is the best game i have ever seen
you look like youre about to cry
how does he know what a nuke is
you can use the grenade launcher to get through the wall
If you lose you can get the bonus level
you got the boots to beat this game
Hey jerma what's the best way to make your pc explode?
what's your favorite meal of the day?
if you ever find yourself in a bathroom you can just use the toilet :)
Jerma you have to do the tutorial before you can do the tutorial
Can you do the sound of the ice cream truck?
I can't believe you're playing this game LUL
Can you turn off the facecam? I want to see you sneeze
just make sure you wear a good hat
Are you going to play the whole game?
is this the streamer that couldn't beat the tutorial?
Hey jerma can you please turn down the music a little bit?
you can get a gun from the shop
you just said that, it's not a spoiler
when are you going to play the new sonic game
imagine being so bad that you accidentally do a pee on stream
I'm sure you'll do it someday.
I
====================
they got rid of the "jermaSour" emote jermaSour
i have a bad feeling about the direction of the stream
i wish i could make this one :(
im playing minecraft with my family right now
What is the most embarrassing thing you have ever said
you need to play the game please
how are you still playing this LUL
imagine being so dumb that you cant figure out how to play a game
you have to go through the portal and get the key
i think you need to get the backpack
my name is also Dr. Smoixan, and i am going to kick you out of my house
You can only get a good mic with this game
you dont need to press the button
this is the most underappreciated stream of the year
you need to get the boots first
hey if you do a co-op jup with ster im going to miss it
Jerma, if you dont say it, I will
you know what they say about a good chat
the camera's on the bottom right side
jermaSour when you get so close to the mic
this is the worst thing I've ever heard
I don't know what the fuck is going on
you know you can go to the right and you can just look for the big ones
You're not gonna be able to get the boots
YOU NEED THE BOOTS TO BEAT THIS GAME
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ GUYS WHAT IF I GET A SUB jermaChomp ðŸ“£
This is the game that makes Jerma feel like he's playing
you have to do the poopoo in the vr
you know you're in a league of your own right?
if you dont do the facecam i will eat my own ass
why does the streamer have a dead dog?
can you turn the music down a bit?
You're gonna be a bostonian on the internet
i have no idea how to play it
you need to get the boots first
I'm so glad you're having fun and that you're doing great. I'm excited for the stream and for you to have fun with your favorite game. jermaHeart
why are you wearing a fishnet over your head?
you got a really nice face when you put it on
you can use it to access the level
you're gonna need to find the boots first
You look like an alien just now
I am going to fucking scream if you dont play the game NotLikeThis
this is what happens when you play games
jerma just sit there and listen to us while we play videogames
do you have the boots to beat this game?
just go to the bathroom, get your food, and come back
I think you can put your pawns into the group, they can be friends
You know what they say about a good chat? When you're not having fun, it's because you're not having fun.
This game is just an alternate reality where jerma is the bad guy
if you don't do it, you'll never get a sub
the puke meter will be lower than usual
you can also pick it up and put it back
I can't believe Jerma is streaming this game.
I'm from the future, you're a train wreck
you have to get the boots first
Are you going to play the new Half Life?
you can't give the right to the king, Jerma
can you make the game sound like it's going a little bit higher pitched?
you're supposed to use it on the last floor
would you rather play this game or the new half life?
jerma should do a fake stream where he just pretends to be bad at the game
Why is the Earth so flat? It's not like that.
You don't have the boots. You need the boots first
Is this the streamer that lost to the first boss of Darkwood?
the stream was so good and you're still here
Hey can you play the rats birthday song on stream?
You don't have the boots, you need the boots first
The boots are
====================
, have a good one chat
this is the worst speedrun I've ever seen
you don't need to be able to do that, you can just make the same level twice
jerma you know that's a lie because you're a boomer
the fish just wants to watch you play
You're gonna get a heart attack if you keep going
the 5th book is the most boring thing
it's not a joke, it's a way of life
this is the most beautiful game i have ever seen
I just got here. Is he going to play more Kenshi?
that's what you get for being bad at it
jerma has a 2 day streak right now
"Jerma, I'm not going to do this"
this is the dark souls of assassins creed
you have to use the right stick to aim the gun
you have to kill the guy to get the picture
jerma is going to be in the next greenscreen
I am so upset at this game
You can do it, but it's really hard.
JERMA YOU HAVE TO RUN THE OTHER WAY
I'm pretty sure the part you were doing earlier is the most recent one.
we are all one guy now :)
You are looking pretty good for your age
you're gonna get banned from the chat
please turn off the music, it's making me so tired
what if you're infected? what if you're infected?
we know you have a bad stream, we just wanted to say that
you need to play the song for this
You have to restart the game to get the secret
JERMA YOU'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH ON THE STREAM
Do a fake Furry suit for the 3rd time
You should play the games you like
jerma are you gonna play monster rancher 4
please just stop playing this and play something else
get a bear trap and put it on the wall
i think you can do the infinite again
you can get a ssd with that
when are you going to finish the first level?
do you have any idea how many times i've been timed out for being too rude
you can make a minecraft server and make it run on your own
it's okay, you can have a little crack
just use your phone to call your girlfriend
Did you know that if you play as the blue bubble kid you can teleport to other blue bubble characters?
That was an absolute disaster for the camera
you're gonna need to change your hair color
this is the longest thing you've ever done on stream
if you could give me a sub i'd give you a kiss
Jerma just do what you want to do
the one thing you can do with that is that it's pretty easy
This is like a 2008 gamecube game
You can do the other one too :)
This is the most fun I've ever had watching a streamer play this
I know you are a big fan of Kenshi but you need to learn to play it right
this is the one where you have to pull out your gun and shoot the victim
HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING TO US HE'S JUST PLAYING THE GAME
its a good game for a bad streamer
You can have a little cracker in the background
HE'S GOING TO PLAY THIS IN 30 MINUTES
why are you guys even here, you know this isn't cool
is this the streamer who ate a shoe ON STREAM?!
"I don't know if I can trust this, but I don't care"
if he isnt here in 2 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
can you actually see what the numbers are?
This is a fucking shitty episode of Jermacraft
this is why you have to stream all the time
you need to bring the ball to the end
I've never seen a game in your life
"how do you get this far?" "a lot of things are easier than this"
you can run at your own pace with that
i think this is why you're the best streamer
LUL why are you guys so mad at him
You need to find the perfect number
this is like the 80s and
====================
, I'm gonna have to go to sleep
is he really making a mario game again?
If you don't like it, don't buy it
I wish he had a facecam so we could see him having fun
can we get some jerma's in chat please :)
you know, this is what happens when you don't have an internet connection
Please turn your volume up, I can hear your feet
I'd rather watch a stream than a vod
You should get some of that sweet sweet sweet coffee
i thought it was the same guy from last night
this is the first stream i've ever watched
I can't believe you did that, that's why I'm here
It's just a fucking anime game, isn't it?
theres a way to do that but you need to use a modded launcher
I have a date with my wife, we'll get married :)
I think you have to change the game.
Do you have any idea how to unlock the ending?
you need to play the new star wars game
do you have the book that gives you a new character
we got some more of the same with this one
jerma you're getting old and you need to get some help
This is the most generic joke I have ever heard
why does jerma sound like he's wearing a backpack
you can jump from the top of the tower
Jerma, you can't just buy a fucking jetpack
jermaChomp P U R G O L jermaChomp
I can't believe he killed that boss, what a psycho
I'm so glad he has a new hero
you should do a second playthrough of this game, and have him try to figure it out
YOU HAVE TO KILL THE OTHER CHAT
I think you just got a tattoo of a guy's face on your chest
the people who made this game need to go to jail
I hate that I can't even imagine what's going to happen
I got banned for saying that in the discord
You're gonna do a fucking gravelly murder her
I can't wait to see this dude get his ass kicked by a guy wearing a football helmet
it's a very early game game, but it's more than a few hours long
they are, it's not the same, but there's a texture difference
you know, I'm something of a gamer myself
It's okay to let the music play on your ipad
I'm only gonna say this because you made a mess in the last mission
dont forget to turn your volume up
I hope you're ready to get the boots in 20 minutes
I think you need to get the boots
you can get a better weapon with this one
so this is what the community is called?
Did you know that if you can read this, you can also write in a language?
Jerma youâ€™re like a child who gets bullied by his teacher
you just need to watch the whole vod
You can turn your cam on for some reason
I think you need to move to the north
you should play the game that is coming out soon.
imagine if jerma was in a real game
this is the dark souls of video games
hey jerma, i'm going to play a game while you do it, but i want to have a blast
I thought this was the last time you played
you're not going to beat the game, you're going to die
there's a secret level in the back area
Jerma, please stop playing this game, it's not funny
I'm trying to watch your stream. You're making me want to punch my wall.
you can go to the right to the beginning
i just want to be a true jerma fan
i thought it was a joke but I'm here
what if we kissed on the keyboard :)
I was watching the stream and you were playing it and I was like
I'm trying to sleep can you do a funny voice
will you be playing the new sonic game?
I hope you can read this message :)
I remember when we were the same height :)
you can turn it off in the settings
it's like saying you're a fly in a box
did you see the new xbox game?
Is this the streamer that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
====================
you can just use the pause menu to skip a level
are you going to play the new animal crossing?
LITERALLY THE MOST FAMOUS THING IN THE UNIVERSE
i only ever got around to the first part of the stream
That's the exact same thing as playing VR in VR
SOMEONE KEEPING YOU COMPASSED TO THE MONEY YOU'VE ALREADY MADE
just make a new account and stream on it
this is what happens when you don't eat your vegetables
What is the next game you're gonna play?
Jerma, I'm just wondering, how long do you think this will be for?
I'm so glad that you're still doing this.
I want to see how long he's gonna go until he gets it right
I'm watching this in an MRI, it's incredible.
YOU HAVE TO DO THE MOST AWFUL THINGS
i can't believe jerma is doing the tuber voice again
This is what it's like to be a person
I think you're just gonna give the wrong answer.
he's gonna hit his head on the door again
Are you gonna play the sequel to this?
you should stop doing the voice so i can finish this whole stream
you gotta put a few jups in the chat
you know you can just go back to the main menu
YOU NEED TO PLAY THE OTHER GAMES
You are a god gamer, you can do this
this is gonna be a great stream :)
i wish i could see the wacky voice
why is there a looong jerma beard in the bottom right
this is what happens when you don't eat your vegetables
if you play like this it will be a lot of fun
you have to beat it in a good way
You just said that you have to take the meds
I just want to say I have been so impressed by this game
if you're reading this, please stop reading. My mom just came in and said I have to leave.
jerma you're supposed to do your homework
Jerma you can't just say it in chat
i think you're going to get a fucking heart attack
you dont need to do anything. just explore
You can make a lot of stuff with just a few buttons
You can see your stats when you look at the bottom
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Saturday. Around 3-4pm PDT!
The same reason people are buying winks is because you have a bad sense of time
it's the first thing you see when you open the stream
You need to change your voice to a french accent
I just got here, why is your facecam on?
if you dont like the game, you can always play the game
If you had to choose between any two answers, which one is better, which one is better, you could easily choose any answer
you could make a good song with the rats
It's like you're saying that is how you die
you can actually just switch to a different character
you could make a good song with the rats
You can just change the font to something better
you can make your own custom soundboard
do you plan on streaming tomorrow? jermaHeart
This is why you should never stream with Ster, chat is the best source of entertainment
HEY CHAT, TURN OFF YOUR PHONE, YOU'RE NOT CRYING
they're giving you a 3rd party controller, so it's fine
if you're good at something never do it for free
you have to go back to the main menu
This is the most cursed game in the world
please get out of the way, I wanna see you fight the big fish
You can just go to the menu and select a level
I love you, you're such a funny person <3
i'm not going to lie, this is a lot of work
you can get a "Show us your feet" badge now
you need to do the others
you have to go to the dungeon
do you know when youll play Black & White 2?
is this the streamer that beat
====================
 before you die
that guy on the right has a weird voice
it's a lot easier to do than it is to do it right
you need to be at least 18 to play
i'm glad the same devs who made this game made it
I have a headache and I just want to see Jerma play it
this is like a fucking birdhouse episode LUL
you gotta do something to them or they won't come back
You know, you might not even be in the mood for this game.
you have to be on the left or right
jerma do you have a clip of the nancy drew streams?
It's an actual good game but a lot of the time you get stuck
I'm sorry, but the worst part of this game is that you can't do anything in the game
Theres a secret room in the main lobby
You need to be on the left or right
I'm going to fucking scream if you play this again
it's a good thing you have a bathrobe
I don't think you can just skip the game
how do you do the shit on the ground?
the sims 3 is coming out in like two months
i bet you can't even beat it
jerma's been on this level for like an hour
if you don't get to the safe house you're not gonna have a chance
I think you need to go back to the sewer room
I've been watching Jerma since like 2015 and I still have no idea what's going on.
It was so fucking funny to watch it
this is a normal day in america @Jerma985
Please do the "I have to do it" joke again
can you make a movie of this one
you dont need to kill the boss, it is already done
you can save your money in the bank
You need to use your Move controllers
This is the only stream that matters to me
you can get the boots by picking up the ring
jerma please stream i want to see your face
did you know that you can make your own pizza?
YOU CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM AND GET A PIZZA
what if you were to die and had to go back in time to save the world
you can see the lines on the wall
I had a friend who made a burger called Mmmmas
you can have two different time zones
I can't wait to see Jerma get embarrassed by a game with the same mechanics as the one he's playing
it's because you're in a car with a radio
i hope he does a cooking stream again
"I'm going to lick your ass" *moves to a place with the same amount of people*
just play what you want to play
theres a secret room in the main lobby
you can use the sword in this game
this is why you dont have friends
I bet you can't even beat this game
You should play a game like Sam & Max
this is like the old game in the library of congress
You have to go to the secret room
i think you are the best, you are the only one that matters
you can make your own pizza if you want
He's gonna lose it all over again OMEGALUL
they're not going to come back after you
what kind of fucking grave do you go to
I know you said you wouldn't, but I'm curious
You can make your own pizza if you want
I'm so excited for this stream I hope you have fun :)
I've been waiting for this whole stream for the last few hours
jermaWalk LET'S GO, LET'S GET SOME CRACK IN THE CHAT jermaWalk
have you ever tried the Chex Mix
You can only find it in the menu
HE COULD BE ANY ONE OF US jermaVenus
I can't believe you just said that
you need to go into the elevator
do you have the boots to go to the brazle room?
i can't wait to see jerma get a brita boy
I think he's just
====================
Can you explain the idea behind the movie, it's a little confusing
I'm not sure what's more confusing, the game or the stream
I have a gun to your head jerma
I just got back, this is the most awesome stream of the year
jerma has been live for almost 24 hours
Oh my god I have this game on my phone
You could play it on your own, if you wanted to
I can't believe you just fucking murdered a guy
the secret game is to get over 50k
you know you're bad at the game right?
you just need to be able to walk
it's just a print out of a picture
did you know that if you use the clicker in real life you can do the face cam?
I think you can just walk with the controller there
There's a lot of things that make it entertaining
I know there's a reason why they're called "in the hospital"
The first part of this game is literally a video game
"Here we are again, your favourite streamer"
you can't just do one of the two
i'm gonna get my finger cut off
It's a game where you have to beat asuras wrath DLC
I'm not kidding, this is a very smart joke
you have to use the main menu in the main menu
i mean, there are some cool things, but not many good ones
its the only one that looks like a car
I know it's not really a joke but can you just say that you're actually very tall and handsome?
This is so sad can we get some jermaPluto
You're supposed to get those blue hearts, they're a pretty good source of health.
what is the name of the guy who made this game?
you can stack crates and put them in your inventory
I thought you said you were gonna play the games tomorrow.
it's not as bad as you made it out to be
what the fuck is up with your voice
Dude, you're a real gamer, you're gonna play this game for the next 2 hours
you have to jump up to the top
I just got here what the fuck is going on
hey jerma can you just say hi to me
i can't believe you just said that LUL
you should have just done it as a joke
you can do this with the DLC
Just wait for the perfect one for the next round
I'm going to pay for a bald coin if you do this
i'll give you $100 if you just beat it
You can play as the new character
it's like this guy just fucking dies in the game
I can't believe Jerma is just fucking around in chat
I'm getting worried that Jerma is going to break into my house and say "I'm going to play MGR"
jermaOld i gotta go to sleep, get me some rest
The only way to save your sanity is to use the cheat codes!
theres literally a table in the middle of the park
please try the new audio compressor, its way better
you can find the phone number on the app store
I'm sure the cops can't handle this game
I heard the game has a problem with audio
you can jump to the top of the castle
would you ever play the super mario rpg?
I can't believe Jerma is late this stream
you should do a run where you only have to beat 1 level
you should make a video of you eating a shoe
Just got here and I already don't understand what's going on
the game is free and it has the game
do you know what a creeper is?
that's not the right way to say "Jerma"
jerma i thought you said you were gonna do something special today
You have to give the gun to the medic
you can buy it on steam but its not on the app store
You just beat the shit out of a goblin
theres a game called "Lost Levels" it's really fun
jermaSour when you eat ass but you don't like it
can you turn your mic up please
====================
 at the same time
LUL i thought he was gonna say "hey guys"
you need to do a backflip for the secret ending
LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
dont forget to wipe your butt on the table
why is this man so good at finding things?
imagine thinking that jerma is good at video games
I was so mad at this game that I didn't even know it was a VR game
play the old wii game it was the best one
you need to keep this up for a few hours
I think you can have a panda express :)
i'm gonna go to bed now, good night everyone jermaHeart
This is just a Jerma985 ad but with more swearing
I can't believe Jerma is actually a furry
I hope he streams at 1pm eastern jermaPluto
I'm sorry for calling you a wuss, but I'll come back to this game.
They'll all die in the game, they're all dead
i want to make a jerma joke :)
Hey can you pause the stream, I gotta go to the bathroom
It's the 2nd time you've said that
youre the one who said that, dont listen to him
i have no idea what the fuck i just got
this game is so good, even for a game released in 2011
Can you explain the joke so far?
jerma has a good look in his eyes
you can just click the screen on your phone
LUL there's a lot of them in this game
can you play the voice actor for this game
I think you're supposed to jump out of the water
If you want to be free, you have to get the boots
you're not even using the most powerful item in the game
that guy is gonna be in a coma
the only reason i like it is the sound
you can't get that many coins in a row, you have to do it in one go
you dont know what a mario is LUL
you can make a new character with those skills
what the fuck is that on the left
i hope he does a real stream :)
It was a good stream, but the audio was too loud
just play the game and make a joke
you guys are all mimics, copying everything somebody says
You can see a lot of people's faces in the bottom right
do you remember when you said you'd play league?
you need to get all the rocks
You can make the gatling gun in this game
did you ever play the wii remote?
You should play a different game if you want to relax
you're too much of a pleb to be a mod
im here for the streamer not the game
HOLY FUCK THE STREAM WAS SO GOOD LMAO
This is why we need to get the boots
you can use it to teleport to any town in the game
Hey Jerma, I know it's a lot but I'm really worried about you
what if you die of old age in this game
i think you need to switch to the middle of the screen
If you get the boots you can use them to open the door
do you know how to play dark souls?
jerma if you don't get the boots i'm unsubbing
You're really good at this game, you're the only one that doesn't know

why does the little girl have a big tummy
you have to grab the rocket launcher to take it
why is the game so much faster than the streamer?
Jerma can you please just play this whole time

It's not even that long it's just like 5 minutes
You have to wait until you get to the real ending
Jerma if you don't play the game by the way I'm unsubbing

I think you need to get better internet, your internet is shit.
I can't believe I have to do this
please turn the game off, it's so boring
you have to press ctrl + space for infinite ammo
do you have the clip of you punching someone
That's a good idea, the whole game is just this
get some rope and start throwing rocks at them
This is like a song from a hip-hop album

you should play a game called Space Truckin
Jerma has been live for 6 hours and 9 minutes
why are you looking so disappointed in your own gamer skill?

you have to use the ladder to get in
Why is Jerma playing a pretend game, I remember him saying that
you can go into the cave and throw a rock
you can use the hook to grab them
make the game music a little higher
I can't believe Jerma is actually playing this game
LUL he doesnt even know what a castle is
The only thing you need to do is turn it off
Jerma, can you please play DUSK on stream? I'm really tired of hearing the same thing over and over
It's like a Mario RPG but you're a rapper
I'm trying to sleep, I don't want to be here

Would you ever play the other Clock Tower games on stream?

====================
I know what you mean but I'll leave now
i would give jerma a 2 star review if he played this
What if you just left your backpack in the kitchen?

LUL this is how Jerma acts when he sees us
You can get it on the internet

The baby ducks are the best thing to happen to this stream
I was doing it for the first time in ages
you can buy it from the merchant
you just have to play the game
he just wants to talk about the stream
you have to beat it in 1st person
It's like that scene in Interstellar where they just fly to each other's heads
you have to collect all the copies of the game
it's funny how many people are in a room and they're all just sitting in silence
theres a quest to get the rat suit
jermaWalk WINK DINK CITY jermaWalk GET OUTTA MY WAY jermaWalk
Would you rather play this on stream or on your own time?
make sure to check the last part of the game, it's really good
Jerma, we know you have a migraine, you're making us suffer.
I don't remember what the halo stream was like
you need to do the end of the game voice
Heâ€™ll be streaming this game for the next 3 days
You're not gonna play this one again?
I think you need to look at the minimap
You have to beat the game in the tutorial
just fucking kill the boss, they can't take damage from blocks
it was a bad game, but it was fun
Jerma is the type of guy to play shitty games on stream
how do you know it's not a joke
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND GUYS, GO LEFT
You can just go to the town
you have a camera that can't be fixed
You need to get to the part where you start eating people
can we get some jermaJex in chat for the stream
you got the wrong door, you got the wrong door
you know you can do it right?
you should play a game with voice acting
I'm pretty sure you're the only one playing this
please play the game. i want to watch you play it
You have to finish it in the next hour
How do you know its not a joke?
I'm not sure if you know this but you're a real gamer
Jerma, you can't just keep ignoring us. We have to know what to do.
It's just a bunch of shit you can break
"I think I'm going to get my ass kicked"
i got a job at the pub and theyre all full time
what if you just gave them a new car
You have to go into the teleporter
is this the streamer that was on the cover of the newgrounds magazine?
you can use the lights to see through the snow
Jerma just give your controller to a friend
You can use the lights to see through the snow
jerma has to move his head when he looks at chat
i hope jerma gets to finish this game today :)
jermaWalk BREEDER BRIGADE WE'RE THE SHIT jermaWalk WE'LL EVEN BREED IN THE TORTURE PIT
Jerma please use the sound of your mic
you can get it on the internet
you can use the lights to see through the snow
I want to watch the VOD now :(
I can't believe Jerma doesn't know what a cutscene is
you have to do it in the DLC
if he doesn't make it i'm going to kill him
it's not that hard to find a vive
There's a shortcut in the front
====================
I have never had a "fucked up" steak
its a ploy to make you feel better about your loss
This game is so good, I can't wait to see what you play
I would love to see jerma play a game called "Twitch"
what if we get the movie for Christmas
Do you think you're gonna play Animal Crossing
I just got here and I already hate this
i got a new car for the price of a new car
it's just a few of the same colors
you can do a rat voice over this game
you're going to get banned from every game
He looks like the kid from the 3rd grade
"Hey, remember me? I was your best friend in high school. Can you help me out with my homework?"
I don't know how I could have gotten these streams
i think it was the first time ive ever seen someone play this game
can you do the gta rp stream with star please
you just bought a new house and you're stuck in the same one for the next 2 years

JERMA, PLEASE READ THIS. YOU'RE A PORN STAR
DUDE CAN YOU PLAY STALKER 2 ON YOUR OWN TIME
I thought this was a scary game for a second
I'd say it's the best game you've played

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6

If you don't do the tuber voice it's too late
it's been a while since i've seen your face
this is just a normal day in the life of Jerma
This game is the funniest thing I've ever seen
what if you go into the tree and go back into the room?
Are you gonna be streaming for the next two days?
I'm so glad I got here early this is so sad
It's just a bunch of broken windows in the background
You don't have to do it again, you can just save it
you can sell your viewers, but you cant sell the subs
You're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOB!
I think you're a bit too high on the system
Play the game "I'm a clown" on stream
You should go to the doctor and get your colonoscopy, he's probably doing a better job than you

you have to let go of the gun
jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
what do i do if I don't get a sub?
It's a reference to the video game The Legend of Bum-bo
why would you want to play this game
I'm waiting for your colonoscopy, but I don't think you should have a colonoscopy.
I'm glad I could watch this stream with my family
i cant believe jerma would lie about eating ass
when the fuck are you going to finish this game?
you could have just done the other thing
That's a really good name for a restaurant
jerma is doing a great job, great job!
It's just a trick of the light
It's like the X-files but not good
how many times have you been to vegas
that was the best part of the game
i just realized he's going to be playing this for the rest of the stream LUL
Theres a whole game in this game thats like 20 hours long
this is the most boring thing I've ever seen
you can't do anything with that without getting beat up
you have to win the fight first try
Jerma I hope you don't forget that time you ate a shoe
are you gonna play the new star wars game?
why are you not using the scout tool
you should have just done the other game
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel on stream?
If you were a robot, would you be happy?
LUL LUL LUL LUL
I'LL BE HERE WHEN YOU DIE, I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU
you know you want to keep the ones you have already
you should be able to use the camera to place things
I've played this game for 10 hours and still haven't beaten it
HE WANTS TO BE BANKRUPT, HE'S GONNA BANKRUPT
this is the only way to win this game
I don't know why people are saying "you can't do that"
you have to talk to the old lady
You have to do a tutorial on the first floor
You need to play "The Unusual" for it to be on steam
it's the game that shows up in the menu
Jerma is only doing it because he's afraid of a gamer moment
why are you so bad at this game
I'm watching this stream right now. I'm going to sleep
This is the only game I can watch
Just buy one of those high end 3ds game collectors edition games
You can play it with the two time
He said he would play it today jermaVenus
why did you take a picture of my girlfriend's feet
I thought he was playing Kenshi today, but I'm not sure
jerma please i am begging you to play it
He is the only one who can save you
i bet he's gonna eat a shoe on stream
you're going to lose the game and get the boots
i remember when you said you were going to start streaming again
I'm not going to tell my friend but you're really good at this game.
I think you need to stop playing so much
Do you remember when you told us you were going to play Super Mario RPG?
i hope he gets to a jerma stream
you said you were gonna play the other game
do you remember the 2ndjerma video where you were talking about how you couldnt beat dark souls 3 on stream?
You can tell me you aren't joking
Jerma, please play the game "Dusk". It's a cool game.
i'm gonna go to bed, see you tomorrow
he just wants to be in the mood

====================
 Jerma
theres a rat in the store, you shouldnt go there

JERMA YOU HAVE TO PICK THE RIGHT MOUSE
You can actually make a ghost pepper and drink it
This is like a good version of the TV show
You can change your colour to brown by clicking on the colour
you're supposed to stay on the edge of the mountain
that guy is a sub and you're not jermaPluto

I'm gonna go to sleep now, good night chat jermaHeart
you have to beat all the main quests
They are called SPIDERMAN. The game's name was Spiderman
why is this game in the same level as Monster Hunter World?
I think you can use a PS4 controller
JERMA STOP PLAYING I WANT TO WATCH THE VIDEO
i can't believe you said that about our favorite streamer
you can switch to the other side of the mountain
Will you be playing the new Animal Crossing?
I had a dream where Jerma ate a shoe and got a hernia
Jerma why are you so obsessed with your own hair?
you can change your colour to brown
you can do it to a robot
you need to change the game to black and white
I'm so glad I was able to catch this stream
I'm pretty sure you are the best in the world
I was going to say that it was a good idea for you to just not stream until 4
you could just do the voice acting for the game and it would be like a 10 hour stream
I think the problem is that you have to be able to see all the stars
this is a game that plays in a video game
just get the game and go to bed
I can't believe you got a bad ending
i had to do it to ember twin
you can see where the eye came from
can you tell the story of when you fought Pinwheel?
its like a really good game but its not a good game
you can see where the eye came from
Jerma do you want to know how to play this game
can you give me a heads up on where you're at
you can go to the bottom of the mountain and go down
you can buy a lot of extra stuff from the store
Jerma you got a little too cute for your own good
Will you play it again this Christmas?
can't wait for the cow to die :)
you're gonna have to kill the other ones
he's never going to finish this game FeelsBadMan
You're not supposed to walk on land
you can see where the eye came from
It's a shame you don't have a good background
Please do the voice of the doctor.
I'm pretty sure that's a sign of dementia
why are you playing a game about money?
It's not even 5 am, he's already playing this
i wish i could stop watching this stream
the only thing you need to do is be able to watch the vod
It was a very good game, not a bad game, but it's not the best game
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THE LAST ONE
I can't believe he can't do it OMEGALUL
please play this game again it's amazing
I'm gonna be real with you, you're a great streamer.

Why is the streamer so good at this?
you can do it in the bathroom too
it's like a really good game but its not good for streaming
you have to talk to the NPC in the town to unlock the secret
why is your character looking like a fucking ant
I just got here, why is he playing a porn game
this is your favorite movie, which is why you're the best
this is the best game ever made by a videogame company

didnt jerma say he was going to play tf2 again?
Jerma, you're not even the same person, you're just walking around
I bet this is the one guy who can't even beat it
what is the point of the game if you can't just kill all the zombies
Just watch it, it'll be a funny joke
i want to be the new jerma985 :)
Oh yeah, I was one of the first three to post a jermaVenus emote

you have to turn off the game
This is the first time Iâ€™ve seen this stream
This is the game that makes Jerma cry
stop trying to make a joke, its not funny
I'm eating a turkey right now and it's SO good
Jerma can you please turn the music down a bit
I thought this was a chill stream. I just got here

jerma is so cool but i'm not sure he would be able to handle the emotes in this chat
Can't wait for the next full moon chat
LUL Jerma just wanted to see you :)

you can have a beer and take a piss
I don't have enough points for a wink
you can't actually kill him, he's a coward
I'm sure he'll be fine but I'm not sure
You're going to get scammed by your own streams, I'm calling it

this is the worst stream of 2020 contender

I'm gonna go take a shower, do the dishes
can you say "woooo" again im begging you
LUL imagine if this was the last game
you can't say anything in chat if you're a sub
you can take a picture of him with the phone
you dont need to keep moving it'll be like a puzzle
can you pause so I can take a pee break
what do you think of the new direction for the series?
I'm sure it'll be fine I can't tell if it's working or not
I'm going to go play some GTA and I'm hyped for the carnival stream

YOU'RE NOT EVEN TALKING TO ME I'M ACTUALLY A ROBOT
Jerma I have to go to bed, can you wait until I get back?
i think i just missed the end of stream
You should put the big trees over the little ones
I like how the music is just the same
how do you do it in this game?
Play the rest of the game, you'll love it
why is the music so good for a 10 year old game
You've been playing this for 6 hours jerma
I feel like this is the beginning of a grim thing
That's a lot of money. You'll need to pay it back
you can still find some but they're not always the best
you can do it on the way back
Can we get a pic of Otto's feet?
I'm watching your stream and I can't believe you said "FUCKING"
I'm a farmer, but I don't like how you're killing people.
You have to go back and get the DLC
what if you're a little too old to play?
It's not a joke, it's a fact
this is the equivalent of a midlife crisis
he can't believe he got a gift sub
did he just say that or did he not realize
He's gonna spend all of it on those wink points
You

Can you do the whole stream in a funny voice please?
Jerma what do you think of the new Sonic game?
so the most you can do to get them is to kill them
I'm back, I wasn't here for the last stream.
you can do it if you're a talented artist
guys i'm a real jerma fan, but you have to admit I'm a little weirded out by the fact that he wears a diaper
you have to get a new helmet
He can't even put the pottery on, it's too much effort
can you give me a recommendation for your restaurant?
did you know that you have a purple tongue
you just announced that you're the best streamer on twitch
you can turn off the music in settings
it's like the new sub sound LUL
you should have known what was coming in the first place
I can't believe Jerma's been doing this for like 10 hours
This is why you shouldn't be playing this
I'm so happy you're finally playing the game, you're so beautiful
I can't wait for the video to be uploaded to youtube

You've been in a coma for 10 years, please wake up
is there a way to give subs and bits?
if you're good at something never do it for free
you need to try to get the 5 stars first
I've got a hard time with that voice
I'm gonna go get some coffee, can you hurry up and start the stream?
it's a hard game, you're gonna have to learn a lot
It's gonna be like, 3 hours of the game
i love you but i can't believe you're a fucking idiot
jerma i thought you were going to say it's called the "furry" genre
I was watching a bunch of old videos and the first one is so good, and it's the best
just press R+F and press A. You can even skip the boss, just a little bit slower
I'm sorry, but you have to let me go now :)

YOU CAN COUNT LIKE THE LADY, JUST NOT THE SNAKE

When you were a child you were a monkey
do you remember the part in the movie where you did that voice?
what do you think of the new game?
please play the game, its not hard
make sure you have a lockpick on your left hand
You gotta go back to the start of the game
this is the most generic game ever made
THE STREAM IS NOW IN POG ONLY MODE
You should play the best version of the game, the one where the human woman is a character
just like in the movies? how did you not know?
can you make the frog a real emote?
You know you're supposed to get the big one

I can't believe he has a bad time LUL
I'm gonna go get some coffee and see if this is going to be a good stream
when did you become a full time Jerma streamer
Jerma is a member of the Drew Crew
Are you gonna play this for the rest of the night?
they're too young to know what it is
it's just a virus to ruin your computer
this game is gonna be so boring OMEGALUL
you're gonna need a lot of bits to make it work
you could have just beaten the game on stream
you're on the moon in the sky jerma
You just said you would never play this again
you can find the item box in the storage you have
jermaFireman_RD I'm the one that's not using the emote
he's gonna get a stroke and die
why is your voice acting so bad
I wish I could be like that
Jerma is gonna spend 3 hours cleaning a casino
I've been gone for 2 hours and you're still playing this?
hey jerma I love your streams and really appreciate them! jermaHeart
I don't think you can beat this game
You can't just say "I am" and "I hate"
Jerma you are the only streamer to ever play this game
you can find the item box in the storage
Jerma when you're ready to stream, just say "Hey, I'm ready to do this"
you are gonna make that joke LUL

Ster is so tall that Jerma can fit him in his chair
if you did that, would you play it?
The only thing that makes a good mario game is the music
You're not even supposed to stream today
you should really check the randomizer, it's super good
what if theres a body on the second floor
why are you playing this when you could be playing this
i wish i had a sub to give jerma
theres a way to get a sub badge
I just got here what the hell is happening
can you do a quick recap of the past few streams?
I'm glad Jerma is finally doing the "I'm a big boy" voice
you can just go to the town portal and get the mushroom
I have never seen someone so bad at a game as Jerma985
JERMA WE'RE ALL SO LAME HE'S STILL HERE
If you keep playing this, you'll get to level 100 and win the game
you can get a better weapon in the second area
jerma please just play this i want to watch this vod
theres a bomb in the room that stops you from getting to it
I think you can use the rocket nozzle to move faster
I don't even know what this is but I love it
is there a cheat to get to the secret level?
hey jerma can you make it so that everytime you die in a level there is a 15% chance that you'll never get to the next level

You're gonna get a lot of tickets
You are going to have a mental breakdown and you're gonna need to get a new one
it's like watching a toddler play with a controller
can you imagine if your game wasn't a shmup
I'll give you $100 if you do this :)
you have to do the first two missions
what if i'm not a real jermaOneguy
the game makes you take damage everytime you fall
you should make a book about how to play a game, it's really good
I hate when chat spams their pogchamps all the time
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2
you just made it a meme to make us happy jermaVenus
how is this so fast and then suddenly I hear the mic?
it isnt a good idea to have a walkthrough
There's a secret level that is good, you can just skip it
you have to wait for the "poop"
Jerma if you were to play this game Iâ€™d be 100% unsubscribed from you
That's what you get for giving me a gift sub
You should have had a good mic
The game will tell you how to do it
you have to put them into the dungeon
can you tell us the story of when you were a bab
make a voice changer so we can listen to it
you can buy the shirts at the store
The one on the right is from when you bought the game

Jerma if you don't show Otto i'm unsubbing
are you gonna play the new expansion?
chat, i just got here, did jerma say what game he's playing?
my dad works at a hardware store and he told me he hates streaming
Oh my god he's still playing this game
You can't do that in a game about photography
You need to watch the video on the right
You should play this in a quiet room
this is gonna be a good stream LUL
put the music back on and play the song from last night
you can change it to a random number
You're really bad at this game huh?
you need to be in the other area
i cant believe you beat the game first try
I wish I could play more games :(
I'm going to play a little bit of megaman
Do you have the mod that adds a healing circle?
you're not allowed to use it in the stream
you look like a yoda character in the movies
Do you have the game version of the shovel?
you can use it in the workshop
Jerma, can you tell me the story of when you were a kid and were afraid of the lickers?
the "I'm a baby" song is so fucking good
you can't just say "I'm a baby" for every story
did you know that there is a giant rat in the forest?
remember when you said that they had to be able to hear you
oh god jerma why are you such a psycho
it's a shame jerma doesn't have a tv
i think he said he's playing the game tomorrow
I'm here because I am a pleb :)
Why are you wearing a T-Shirt? OMEGALUL
this game was designed to be played by babies
this is how jerma gets his money back
YOU HAVE TO GET THE ENCHANT ON
You can get a lot of stuff in this game, but you won't get any of the cool stuff in the game
Can you show us your feet on stream?
you're not the only one that would like that
I'm just gonna say you have the best music
the narrator is like a second from the mic
I'm just gonna say that, you're the best
have you seen the face of death in this game?
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
you've been in the water for 2 hours
jerma is a zoomer so he can't be late
you need to be able to shoot with your hand
I'm trying to be the best I can
You can't say "I'm a baby" in front of a mirror, it's an automatic "I'm a baby"
this game is just a scary game LUL
what's the best emote for this one?
I am so excited for this stream :)
I can't believe Jerma is finally playing a game that is actually fun and funny
I can't believe he's not even playing the game
theres a new ride in the air
jermaWalk jermaOtto jermaWalk I'm just a Otto. jermaJex2
What do you think of the new Warcraft 3 expansion?
Hey guys, what if you're the only one who died
didnt even know that was a thing LUL
you should do a post-stream talk with us
You are a god gamer, you can do this.
you need to look at the bottom of the ocean
you have to do a new level
i hope the next jerma rumble is a clown car
jermaOld I remember when this was a good game jermaOld
use the snake mouth on the ball
i feel like jerma would love this game
imagine the effects if you
====================
TV
How many tickets did you give up on that clown?
Do you think you'll be streaming in the next like 5 years?
if you dont do it i will
You have to go to the next game
that's why you have a fake name
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -34. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I love how Jerma is a fan of the game but has never played it
i cant believe youre playing this game for the first time
what if jerma is just a fucking furry
Just because you arent a redditor doesnt mean youre not a redditor
this is like the end of the game
why is this game so fun i love it
Jerma is going to turn on the cam and be naked
you need to find a way to buy more tickets
you're making me think you're going to be a professional poker player
can you get the lipstick off its a little messy
just like how jerma is trying to be cool
This is the most annoying thing I've ever heard
you need to wait for the boss
i'm gonna go watch a vod of this, can you finish the game or I'm gonna go get a soda?
that's why they make these games, to be the absolute worst
how much money have you spent on that
jerma, have you ever played the new binding of isaac?
WHY DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A DIRTY DUNCE CONTAINER
they're the same character, just they're different names
i dont think this is a very good game
you can make the boots your own
The only thing you can do is eat a shoe
I'm ready for this stream to end LUL
you can get your own character here
You know you can do it with the mouse and keyboard
i miss the old jerma that would play ps3 games
I just got here and I can't believe you can't make this shit
you can use the mouse and keyboard
you can use the scroll wheel to move
do you know what a TTS is?
jermaOld the internet wasnt bad theres a lot of those old ass games i dont remember
theres a reason that jerma isnt on twitch
They are made of glass and are glass they cant see you
you got the better of us last time
HOLY SHIT I CAN SEE THE EVIL IN YOUR EYES
you can make the boots your own
Hey Jerma, I'm getting your Level Up bonus
you can always make your own character :)
I bet you have a lot of money
Do you know what a TTS is?
why did you think that was a bad idea
I would be so happy if you streamed on weekends
theres a video of a guy in the showers
imagine thinking this game is a good idea
This is the best thing I have ever seen
Jerma do you eat ass on stream? @Jerma985
The person who made the music is a fan of yours.
you need to see the fucking vod
have you tried using a controller? You're gonna get a migraine
jerma i have to go to work in 5 minutes
we're not gonna tell you anything
I think you should go back to the swamp
I'm so glad I can be the one guy for this stream
HE JUMPS OFF THE TRAILER AND DOWN TO THE ICE BELOW!
I'm having a heart attack, please stop playing this game. I'm trying to watch the movie.
this is the most boring thing ive ever seen
I'm going to be so mad if you don't stream today
It's a shame it didn't get nominated for worst stream
I just got here, is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
this is a very good game for jerma
I'm trying to eat but I'm dummy thicc

HES GONNA STAY IN THE CLOSET FOR 10 YEARS

you said you were gonna play this for 2 hours
how many times do you have to tell us you beat this game on stream?
The only way to win is not to play
Do you have any plans for New Years?
I can't believe this is the same streamer who beat Dark Souls on stream
did you know that 90% of all humans are women
just put it on your resume, its the only way to prove you're not a serial killer
you can get a vive from the gamecube
he's going to do the whole thing again
JERMA YOU'RE SO BAD AT THIS GAME OH MY GOD
Have you heard of a game called "The Surge"
It's because you don't know how to open a door
You can't let your mom know about your sick and demented gambling addiction
Just do a stream where you do the same thing
you need to do a little more damage
just make it a new thing to use
I have a weird feeling Jerma is the only streamer who can get a better ending than this
DUDE WHAT IF YOU WERE RIGHT THERE WITH THE DUDES
You could just make it look like a mountain
it's just a flat tire that doesnt have a tire on it
This game is for people who are not already bored
i got my own pc and it's all fucking broken
you can go to the store to buy more
You have to turn on the steam overlay
I'm a professional and I'm not going to lie this is pretty cringe
I'm so glad I got a sub! jermaHeart jermaHeart
You need to make the green screen green
go to the main menu, there's a new game
this is a horror game, not a game
if you get the boots you can kill people
you're gonna have to do the same thing again
if you're not playing the game right now, I don't think you're capable of beating it
you got the best part of the game
You don't need to get the boots, you're already on the tutorial level.
you need to go back to the area you just went in
you can't go back to the town, they're all gone
I wish I was playing this on the Xbox
Jerma you're not a real gamer you're a fake gamer
it's been like an hour, please keep it up
just use a controller and aim the gun
can you tell us a story about how you got a girlfriend and started streaming?
You can only take one of the two
you can get the boots by grinding them with a hammer
You got the boots for this, you can do it now
You need to do the other side of the fence
jermaWalk hey guys look at this jermaWalk
You can get the boots by grinding them with a hammer
I didn't know there was a youtube video
This is the worst game I've ever seen
why does this game look like a shitty mobile game
I think you need to move the mouse
What do you think of the new star wars?
i can hear the music in your head
I think you have to hold shift to press it
you can get the boots by grinding them with a hammer
just use the controller and aim the gun
You can do it in the tutorial
I hope you're ready for your 21st anniversary today
You can do this in the tutorial
why do you look like a twink LUL
Jerma you know what's better than a good burger? A burger that tastes good and has a good lettuce wrap on it.
@Jerma985
====================
you can use the time machine to get more money
YOU CAN DO IT YOU'RE A VAMPIRE YOU'LL GET MORE THAN 2 MILLION
can we get some more heroes of might and magic in the chat
what the fuck is going on here? monkaS
i think it was a little after the first half
i'm not sure how much of a fuck up it is
they're going to buy it for a million
Is this the guy that beat TTT on stream?
Hes gonna go back to his home planet
if you do a 24 hour stream you are not allowed to use the toilet
I can't believe you just slapped yourself
play the game the game is boring
he doesn't have the boots, he has the sword
do you have to do the whole floor
he's gonna be on the edge of his seat
If you could play a real life match, what would it be?
if you play this game i will donate 5 dollars
You can get a higher level weapon
I'm gonna have a fucking field day with this
I think Jerma is going to die in 2 days
if you're good at something never do it for free
jerma is an actor and we're all just a figment of his imagination
are you going to be on the stream for another hour?
how does it feel to be old enough to be Jim Carrey's dad
jerma is just a regular human in a zoo
why are you so bad at this game
The guy who made this game is a furry
Why are you playing this game again?
you are the only streamer i watched live
I think you are a bit short btw
When are you gonna play the new MGS?
I can't believe he's playing this, he's gonna die
I'm sorry Jeremy, but I'm gonna be honest. I'm not sure what's going on.
"You're not gonna get any of those." - Jerma
this is the most generic, generic game ive ever seen
you can use a vending machine to sell your stuff
I think you are supposed to do it with the whole party
this is the worst game ive ever seen
you can only get the ring at the end of the game
have you ever played a video game before?
theres a new mission that gives you a key
you can buy better items from the shop
I'd rather watch this than Super Mario RPG
You can't use the Pile on the dead bodies.
you're gonna be a complete psycho for a while
i want to go to sleep, see you guys at the next stream
what is the point of the bingo board
You just need to let it go
I hope he beats this game, I miss the old Jerma
you can get a better weapon with the two chests
there's no way you're going to beat this game
theres a way to do it in a few seconds
this is what happens when you don't cook for 5 minutes straight
you have to do a cooking stream
JERMA GET THE FUCKING BELL BUILDING FOR THE BATHROOM
It's like a guy who's in a coma
JERMA YOU HAVE TO PLAY JERMA YOU'RE LITERALLY DYING
you have to open the game files
what the fuck is happening to this game
You can get a lot of stuff from the shop
you can use the time machine to get more money
How long has he been in this game
can you play this game again, I missed it
I have a lot of work to do, but I'm so glad I got here
what if you were a slave? would you eat your food?
im gonna go to bed and wake up and see jerma still playing
Hey, just got here, what's going on?
I have to be honest, I don't know
you need to learn the game's mechanics
you can buy better items from the shop
Is this the streamer that beat Pinwheel on stream?
remember when you said you were going to beat it in one try?
you can just tell us what you think
@Jerma985
====================
well?
You can just shoot him without the turrets
YOU NEED TO DO THE VOICE OVER FOR THIS
you have to actually use the shell
you dont need to hit anything with it
Hey jerma, can you play the game again
it's not that bad, it's just that the game is really good
this is the least relaxing game i've ever seen
you should try to get the best weapon
What the fuck is going on in this game
this game is a literal ripoff of the dark souls of video games
you are a good friend and I hope you have a good night
jerma hasnt even streamed in 8 years :(
hey theres a bar of soap you can buy at the store
i like how you can just click the screen and it'll show you what to do
You can also do a "Dodge" run with the boots
I think that's why he is so much better at this game
i'll make you a 5 star meal
jermaDafoe you know i'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
What if we kissed in the Jerma Rumble? ðŸ˜³
you can see the "inb4" monster in the bottom left
put the disk in the microwave in the microwave oven
I'm very confused as to why you are still playing this game.
can you turn your mic down a little?
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
It's a good game. It's just not that good.
theres a secret ending if you don't get it
We need to find the best way to talk to yourself
jermaWalk jermaOtto jermaJex2 jermaMerc jermaJex2 jermaOld jermaPop jermaChomp jermaFireman jermaTV jermaVenus jermaChomp jermaBld jermaVenus
i think it's a bit early for him to even be here
imagine thinking that a rooster has a leg
I'm a big fan of the Ace Attorney streams, they're so relaxing and fun
you can literally just use the flamethrower, it's good
try to get to the end of the game
You're in a good mood, can you stop talking?
What the fuck is this game and why does it look so bad?
jerma how do you feel about the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
you can use the lance to parry their attacks
did you know that you can beat a level with a character named "Lazy-assed"?
you have to use the shell to parry their attacks
your character is wearing a hat and a backpack
if you had to choose one to eat, which one would you pick
can you do a carnival stream where you do a carnival stream where you pretend to be playing a game?
i think its for the clown car jerma
It's a lot better than the first game
it's ok to do it. we don't need to be happy anymore
I'm pretty sure you can use the spear
you can buy the sword in the shop
"I'm not gonna play it" proceeds to play it
you have to get the door to go through the locked door
what if the server crashes and you lose your key
if you get 100 in a row, you can do it
I'm gonna go watch a vod now jermaPluto
Can you please do the whole game again?
go to the shop and equip the ring
do you have the boots to beat the final boss?
he was supposed to be at the end of the stream
you can get the axe in the shop
Are you the one who did the blue screen
You have to go into the building and grab the ring
What's the most disgusting thing you've ever done?
Iâ€™m just going to let it go
I think the main character of this game is really good
you're in a good mood, can you stop talking?
you can use the shell to parry their attacks
the game can only take up to 25 minutes, remember to
====================
it's a bit of a pain in the ass
You should make an alternate reality where you are the giant rat who makes all of the rules.
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaComet jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
what the fuck did i just tune into
I can't wait for the Jerma vs Ster brawl
I remember the first time I played this game
i want to be in a relationship with this guy
get a copy of the game from blockbuster, they also make games like this on pc
Why is this guy so stressed? He's literally doing nothing
This is a good way to start the stream
you can do the fall joke again
you need to build up your army first
Hey Jerma, I'm a fan of your Twitch and I'm really excited to see you play the game!
hey , if you had to bet money on whether or not you would do it myself, would you do it in real life?
Do you know what the carnival stream is called?
oh yeah that's why i like the songs
You can buy a new body with the new currency
is it just me or is the game kinda quiet compared to others
you can make an arena with the monkeys
you're the only one who has to play this game
this is a good place to start if you're new to the game
jerma, i would appreciate some extra life-changing nutrients
i wish i was a dev in this chat
it's not like you're trying to kill people
what happened to the vr camera jermaPluto
can you use the fire breath to burn the thing with a torch
you're supposed to be the small guy
its a good thing you're not streaming right now because i'm going to bed.
this is the worst stream i've ever watched
i want to be able to see you
this is the same thing with the DLCs
i want to be able to see you
i want to see a streamer play a game for free
when is the last time you did this
you need to learn how to talk
why does this game have the music playing in the background
I don't remember this game being this good
this is a good place to start if you're new to the game
I'm glad you're having fun, keep it up jermaHeart
you know you can have a family and be happy
you can do it without the boots
did you know that a little girl named Kreygasm is a serial killer in Las Vegas?
is this the streamer who lost to pinwheel?
remember to use the axe to cut the guy down
Can you tell me what a mop is
Can you do a Jerma impression, that'll be so funny :)
i want to be able to see you
you can get a free subscription to jerma985
Thats the point of the game, you're just playing it
you don't have to kill them, just make them stronger
play the game where you take a shit
they're not giving you money, they're just paying you to use the pawn
If youre gonna play Sam & Max, play Sam & Max 2.
this is just the cover of a movie
can you add the new channel points to the channel points system?
it is the same as the original
if you get hit, you have to play Sam & Max
do you have the mod for this game?
Can you do the Scout voice again
I think you can put it in the options
can you please go back to the past
Hey Jerma, I'm going to the store and I wanna buy some drinks.
Is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
how did they even get to the end
You're not allowed to have a kid with a wife
this is just the first one, theres more
There is a bug in the game where you can't open doors with a key
I'm glad we have a carnival stream now, thanks for the laughs
You should be able to do this without the boots
i cant
====================
I hope he plays the new Sonic Adventure games
its not like you have to watch every single stream to get a sub
is it true that you're going to be streaming LOTR tomorrow?
i know that this is a joke but you can stop pretending to be bad at video games
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR LIKE 20 YEARS NOW, STOP IT
I have been telling you for years, you'll never beat this.
i would love to see jerma play kenshi again
You should play the other two games. one is good, the other is trash
you should take a break and get some sleep
I'm so confused, do I just not know what's going on
You know how to play this right?
SourPls O O (ditto) D I D SourPls
you're not even a real gamer, you're just a complete gamer
it's not the best game, but you're getting there
You can do a high level rap in this game
you can go to the left temple
i love that you can make a town out of an entire island
play the new mario game please :)
you are not a real gamer you're just a complete boomer
you can just click on the screen
are you gonna play the new sonic adventure?
it says your channel has been in a coma for 6 years
this is what happens when you give a lecture
I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life
You have to pay the price for your sins
why are you not using the cheats from the last game
I'm having a great time but I can't watch this stream
jermaPluto im gonna go watch some vinny vod
you should do the sims 4 part 2
I don't know who he is but he sounds pretty damn cool
I wish Jerma would do more streams where he has a sense of humor
i have a friend that works at a local boston pizza place
the 5G towers are just messing with you
i think jerma has a really good microphone
you should play the new level of overwatch
they did a rerun of the movie with a different director and it was a very bad time
This is one of those times where it feels like you are playing a game and it feels like you are just in a room with no lights
This is one of those streams that makes me cry
you can turn down the difficulty by clicking the start menu button
jermaWalk ON MY WAY TO VOTE FOR THE NEXT JERMA STREAM
It's not a joke, but it's an offense
how can you even have a career without that
you don't need to tell us anything about the game
that's just a "no one is coming" sign
you just need to be a mod to get a mod
I'm surprised you didn't play some game
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
i'm a big fan of the persona stream
you need to find the secret door
you can get the 2nd one at the beginning
When are you going to do the MGR DLC?
I'll let you borrow my guitar
You're not a real gamer, you're a complete boomer
Can you play the new Sonic Adventure game please
This is the most powerful thing you've ever done
do you have a condition where you can't wear shoes?
I love the first game, but this is really cool
You can do it jerma, we believe in you!
I would think you'd be a better streamer
The physics are off, the game is crashing
Did you know that every human being has a penis?
I'm not sure if he actually does that
Hey, can we just go back to the game now?
you have to find the secret door
What if they're just having a bad time
If you're good at something never do it for free
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys what the fuck jermaJup3 jermaJup4
can you play the new simpsons game
why is the voice acting in this game so bad
is this the guy who died to pinwheel
you need to set up a BAG
@Jerma
====================
U
The only thing that would get people to buy it is a shitty plush
They're not in the same universe as Jex
why is there a side button in the bottom right
theres a secret boss in this game
I'm gonna go get some food, hurry
You can only use one item at a time
I'm so excited to see Jerma try and beat this game
I'm so glad you're playing this, I'm really glad you're playing this.
I'm gonna play this game for the next 2 years
you gotta go back to the beginning
that's the best thing to happen to you
you can't just stream until the next game
jerma has a virus and is forcing us to watch him play this
are you a doctor or a dentist?
There was a guy that had that on his shirt
you can look at your own personal profile picture
Jerma when are you going to play the entirety of Peggle 2
what if theres a fucking elephant in the room?
You know you're going to have to do that
when are you going to play Half Life?
jerma is so good at making people feel bad
hey can you pause the game i need to pee
You're making me feel like I'm in a fever dream.
I don't think Jerma knows what a game is
jermaPluto it's a good thing we're all here
you should have known that was a joke
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I've been playing Civ in an arcade for the last 2 hours.
I'm from the future, I don't know how to predict the future
"I'm not gonna play this game for another 10 hours"
can you say "I'm not going to play this game" for me?
I'm not sure if this is a joke or not
I'm going to sleep if you don't finish this
why do you look so much like your mom
you can click on the planet to see a planet
I'm trying to get my hands on a copy of star wars
you're in a cave and a skeleton is about to ambush you
If you do the Mega Man Legends stream I will be so fucking mad
do you know when youll play persona?
jerma is the most famous person on the planet
are you going to play the rest of the game
Theres a secret boss in this game
what are you doing with your life? @Jerma985
can you play the music so we can all hear it?
this game is a very good game i think
I don't think you can make it through the day
You can't go back to the beginning of a level without a checkpoint
do you know what a gamer is
YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR OVER 8 MONTHS
Can you play the rest of the game please?
We can see the reflection of your face in the mirror
I'm going to get sick of this game
The game is really hard, but the writing is so good
i wonder if he'll be playing the whole thing
You can use the Chomp Chomp sound to attract enemies
are you going to play the game?
you need to use the axe, it's better
when are you going to play The Great Gatsby?
I have a feeling you would like it
you should watch the black and white 2 remake
you're the only one who's not gonna play it
Jerma you need to listen to the music again
how can you be so bad at this game
YOU CAN LITERALLY GET THE SOUP FROM THE KIDS
can you use the wrench to make a ladder
this is like the greatest thing you've ever done
you can see the reflection of your face in the mirror in the mirror
If you hit the dash button you can dash over the edge
i like how he has the same amount of health as before
JERMA YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE TOP
They just don't want you to do it
I hate how this game has such a low budget
You need to go back to the first
====================
i want to watch jerma play minecraft but its too hard to watch
I'm going to unsub if you don't stream today
I'm sorry Jerma, I have to go to bed
you said you would play animal crossing on stream
jermaOld why do you have a pack of gum
i cant believe jerma is streaming from a cave
just admit it, you're a pretty cool dude :)
can you show us your feet for us
You can use the circle to walk around the map
he's probably doing the bingo card for the stream
it's a good thing you don't die to pinwheel
it takes a while to get a good map
this is like a game that I would play
I'm sorry jerma, but you can't even get past the first level.
jerma is still trying to find the dreamcast
can't wait to see how many streams he will have to do
I just got here, what's the game? :)
I love how he's just a normal person
why is the monster in this game so good
you have to go through the sewers
That's a good way to die. You're gonna die.
it's a good thing you don't die to Pinwheel
you can turn off the music in the options
We need to talk about the new Adam Sandler movie please
I just got here, what is this
I don't know if I want to watch this anymore
if you were to play the first game, you'd probably be able to beat it
I can't wait for the Labo stream :)
Jerma, what would you rate this game out of 10?
jermaOld what is this in my mouth again
You're gonna get some work done :)
you can't tell me what to do with my life
did you see the new Star Wars trailer
this game is gonna make me a fuckton of money
This is the worst game you've ever played
theres a secret level, you can beat it
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR AN EASY MODE
you can make a new monster with this
i thought you said you would play animal crossing today
why is your room so clean and clean
you can just walk on the water and then you can walk on land
theres a mod to make it so that you can't get all the chests and then you can get a new game
we're gonna be here for a while
I'm so glad you're doing this to yourself
you could've been a seagull if you saved us
why do you have to be so late
If you're gonna do another stream where you say "oh my god" then why not do a stream where you just say "oh my god"
JERMA, PLEASE READ THIS. ITS A COMMENTARY. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTJ02h7uiXs
you know how to get a license?
He can't see it if he's in the chat
i think you need to set the game to something else
what if i don't want to watch this stream jermaPluto
you are all the way to the top
its not like you want to play, its like you're playing a game of chance
you need to do a better job
I want to get off Mr. Bones wild ride
What if I want to be a furry?
I'm watching the entire stream and I'm bored
You can't get past the first level, so just go all the way up
jerma please go to the gym and do pushups
what are you even trying to tell me you're not going to do it
oh my god he's still playing this game
jermaDafoe I am something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
if you play this game i'll give you a million dollars
Jerma is the type of guy who would give you a million dollars
I'm going to kick your butt if you keep playing this
if you go back to the ring, you can get the shield
theres a hidden cave under the house
you can get the pink ring from the cave
I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there's a good chance you could get it
That's the most generic
====================
Jerma is just the weird kid who buys all the toys
i just got here, why is jerma playing with a controller?
I don't like that the music is just a song
This is a good game for Jerma to watch
this is the guy that died to pinwheel
The only way to stop this is to play more
i'm not gonna lie, this is really fun
are you sure you're not a furry
I didn't have to do this at my local library, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the game
i dont think youre gonna be able to do that
can you turn the game volume down please?
this is the most boring thing i have ever watched
i'm going to head out too, have fun with my ex wife and kids
yeah but it would be way more fun to just go to the store and buy some food
you should check out the new casino inc
I hate this fucking Jerma guy, he's so old
have you seen the new house flipper
i have to leave soon i want to go to bed
if you dont stop talking about the foreskin i will unsub

I would suggest the first game being played over and over again. The second is best
hey guys, just got here. how long has he been playing this?

there are a few things you can do
it's not your fault you just have to listen to me
this is just like the end of the war
The first time was a bit better, but the second is much better
you can buy a new memory card from a random person for $10
I can't believe Jerma beat the game on stream
You need to be the best at the game

This is like the dark souls of DS2
Why is Jerma so obsessed with the dreamcast?
you can get another for free if you do a little bit of scuba
I thought you were going to play Odama
this is a really good intro to a game
It's the 8th time you've said you're a liar
would you play the super mario sunshine
How do you feel about the amount of time you've been playing this game?
I think you can only buy them at the merchant
jermaDafoe_HF I know what Jerma means by "Duck"
I want to see the people get their tickets
i like how it doesn't matter if they're free
I've seen Jerma do it before, I can confirm
you need to get more seeds, it will be easier to get them
I'd rather watch the movie than this shit
I can't believe Jerma's gonna do the â€œwhat is thisâ€ joke
LUL LUL oh shit i'm going to the bathroom
the only reason i came here for the vod was for the clip
they have a new version of the game
please click the link. i am trying to watch the vod
you're missing a key in the last room
is this the guy that beat jump king on stream?
if you think you're a threat, just do it
you look like a child in a wheelchair
did you hear the new smash update is out
DONT PUT THE PICTURE IN THE DISCORD PLEASE
i have no idea what im looking at
Just wait for the next stream to start
will you do the voice actor again
I'm not gonna lie, this looks pretty sick
The new Star Wars game is good, but it's not going to be a good stream game
That's a lot of money to make you do that
Jerma you're not supposed to be playing this, this is just gonna be a game of chance
i just woke up how long has he been streaming
You're just too old for this game
You can get the boots for free
you should just play a game that isn't called "anime"
You could do a whole stream where you just talk about how much you hate everything and you get like 3 million views
You have to put them in the right order
you should look at the next vod, if you want to see it again
You're going to get scammed by this game
it's the end of the game screen
its been like 10 minutes you can leave now
You're not supposed to use it in the right order
this is what you get for not saving
hey can you get a new mic?
jerma is going to get a migraine and then go live
hey guys, anyone know of a link to the old jerma video where he talks about how he was a "cool" streamer?
play the oscar winning movie "The Iron Giant"
this is just the beginning of the stream
please do another QTE jerma its just the beginning
just give the controller to the main character
you can play it with the person you just found
I think the game would just be called "Parappa"
I think he means you're on a date
you could do a whole stream where you just talk about how much you hate everything and you get like 3 million views on Twitch
how do i get a sub? thanks in advance :)
this is the first time you've played this game
@Jerma985
====================
you should play the final fantasy series
this is like the dude that lost to pinwheel
why does the main character look like a mule
are you going to be playing the next Nancy Drew game?
This is like a 5 star movie
why are you using the ez bake oven
I can't believe you put your facecam on
you can jump on the rock with the axe
Dude you're in a coma, wake up Jerma
this is a good time to mention how dumb jerma is
I'm so glad I came back to see you still in the same spot
You're gonna be playing as the scout
There's a song called "Wake Me Up" by the Boys
jerma you need to have a lotta cheese
Jerma is gonna take a bath in the bath water
I was just listening to the VOD when this happened
I thought this was a movie game stream
you can get a lot of them from the trader at the trader shop
put the two towers into one zone
This is the only game I've ever seen that doesn't require you to be mentally able to play
jerma has the worst gamer moment of 2020
I'm gonna make a fake account to troll you
you got a lot of free time
i'm gonna be so confused when the game awards starts

this is the worst fucking game of 2020
you need to make it with the ice cream
hey jerma have you ever considered playing the new star wars game on stream?

theres a switch version of the game
have you ever thought about doing a stream with Joel?
chat is moving so fast nobody will know that i love jerma
This is the worst fucking thing you've ever done
your current joke score is -10
JERMA YOU'RE GONNA GET STUCK IN THE MIRROR
JERMA DONT FALL FOR THE MONEY CUBE

I'm gonna go to sleep, good night everyone
if you say that again I'm unsubbing

play the katamari ost it's very fitting
jerma you can have a dlc of this game
if you die on the final boss you die in real life
i love how the gameplay is a little off
Do you want to be the first person to play the game?
I'm glad Jerma is playing this game instead of playing like a fucking idiot idiot stupid streamer
you can actually make your own robe and skin
you're going to lose so many viewers if you don't start
i remember playing this game like 12 years ago
You are not the same person that played the game
Jerma, how do I get my notification to work?
that was the most stupid thing you've said
this is like the rest of the game
You're supposed to just read the wiki
Did you know that the ball was made of pee?
Hey Jerma, I'm a new viewer, and this is my first time coming into this stream. How is your hair?
you can get an item from the shop
you could have done it all at once
why does the main character look like a homeless bum
Dude it's called the Gameboy Advance, you know what I mean
jerma please do the slow down sound in the pause menu
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
I didn't know you were a furry
he has the most powerful attack, so you need to learn it
you can get a lot of items from the trader at the trader shop
J
====================
 the one guy that thinks "i love you"
I have to pee can you pause the stream
you're just trying to make it up as you go along
you should play kenshi. its like that one video game
this is gonna be a good stream jerma
I've never seen someone so bad at a game as bad at a game as jerma
you're just trying to put it on a plate and then eat it
i feel like he's really good at the game
we should all go to bed at the same time
you're not even playing the game right now
Jerma do you know how to play this game?
i am so fucking hungry for jerma rumble content
The music for this game is just so good
JERMA YOU HAVE TO PLAY GRILLERS OF WAR
your mother is in chat, you have to tell her to stop playing
YOU HAD A WIFE IN THE FRONT ROOM

You have to use the Right Click option to select the target.
It's not a bug, it's a virus
Is this the streamer who didn't beat the first level of the game?
he's gonna have a bad time if he doesn't
you can use the right click menu to select the target
how many people did you try to make a noise before you died?
i would have finished this game in 2 minutes if you hadnt died
you got a good lookin' tonight

i don't think i've ever heard that song before
I'm sorry you're going through the same thing.
Jerma you are a real gamer man you can do it

the game can be turned off at any time, you just have to turn it on again
I hope you get some of the souls hearts
You could say it's a meme, but Jerma is a real person.
You can also pick up stuff by holding a button, it's not a hard mechanic
you need to be able to jump off the roof

====================
the idea of a jerma stream is to just watch a stream and be like "i wanna see the ending"
you are the best streamer on twitch. I am
He's too busy watching the VODs of his own streams
This is a good time to get a shower
You need to get a better weapon, not that one

just wait for the credits and youll be fine
you have to bring the axe to the party
I've been watching this stream for like 10 minutes and I still don't know what's going on

I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
This is one of those games that makes you want to run it
you need to use the book to unlock the secret ending
you can use the axe to kill the guard
you can do it in the other room
just make a new account and you'll be fine
you can use the axe to kill the guard

i am so glad i got to watch this stream
there's no way he can do it, he has to wait
when you're supposed to be streaming, you're gonna have to wait until the stream starts
you have to go back to the top
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
is this the guy that beat dark souls on stream
i just got back, is he still doing the vr joke?
I don't know how to explain this game
Jerma was a substitute teacher but he knows what he's doing
Hey guys I just got here. Is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
i don't have any of that, i'm not even here
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead :(
Jerma if you're here keep it at 1 million I'll give you $5
This is just like that one part in the movie where they don't see their friend
i feel like this is a lot easier now
I've been waiting for the green screen stream
I'm going to be the one guy
you can't eat a raw egg with a fork
I think this is the best game ever made
Jerma I know you're not very good at games, but I think you've really improved over the years.
youre the best streamer on twitch, thanks for all the laughs and laughs <3
Jerma are you gonna play the new season of Sam & Max?
this game is so bad, i hate it
what the fuck is going on in this chat
you can move the torch to the torch
you can do it with the shovel
but i have to buy them to watch the stream
you can turn the game volume up to 480
Why do you have so many people watching you?
this is a lot of content but I can't tell if you're having fun or not
are you sure this is not a dream?
you can use the shovel to cut down trees in this game
Jerma you could just play the whole game
you need to learn to build a city
I'm ready to go to the store and buy a game of thrones print, it's on the shelves!
the police are here you can stop pretending
i'm back, why are you still here?
oh my god that is the most fucked up thing i've ever heard
can you play the new skyrim? its really good
Jerma I'm gonna be honest, I don't know what this is.
You're supposed to do the movements and the jump
Would you ever consider doing a stream with etalyx?
Why are you so invested in this game
I think you need to buy the game
I'm gonna be honest, I don't know what this is.
you can use the shovel to cut down trees in this game
I'm not a sub, but I have a lot of subs
you need to pay the debt, you can do it
this game has a lot of neat features that i wouldnt have thought of
what would you rate this game out of 10?
@Jerma
====================
 but for real you need to learn the controls
I'll eat a shoe if you say so
what is the minimum to get into the server?
If you have a bad internet, that's a problem
you can only take 3 items at a time
Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I think you can shoot them with the shield
i think you need to be in the middle
I wish I was a little kid in the middle of the ages
I am so glad that the emote is still in place
you can just walk through the door and leave
I bet you're also on the FASTEST STREAMER
Just wait for the boots to drop
will you ever play the new cooking mama?
I'm going to try and get some Vroomer in the chat
I'm having a mental break, I can't wait
what if you did a joke where you're on the side of the house and the door swings open
This is the worst song in the game
the guy who made this game is actually a chat member
you can't just shoot the whole building, it has to be a single room
what is he even talking about it's just a visual novel LUL
you have to find the door and then use it
theres no way to win that, its not worth it
im gonna go to sleep. thanks for the stream jermaHeart
Do you know what the character sounds like?
play this level or you're a liar
I'm having a heart attack, and my doctor says I'm going to die. Please help me.
stop playing the game you are making me hate you
i had the game open on my phone for a while
you should play the new level "Ster"
you should play the newest one "Oblique"
you can just keep going and get the boots
did jerma ever show us a picture of his penis?
You should have just watched the whole movie
play the rest of the game, you will enjoy it :)
i was in a fucking coma for 3 years
do you know what a gatorade scoop is
just get the boots on the other side of the house
I'm gonna make a video on this LUL
we are all waiting for you to finish the game
You have to kill the ghosts before the zombies
just wait until you see the frog man
can you do the face cam again please
Is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
You should do a cooking stream where you make your own food
we all know this is a good time
I know how to get a divorce, just ask me
Just watch the whole thing on youtube LUL
i've got a great idea, make it a vid where we can see you in the mirror in real life
you can just start over with the boots
Jerma is going to have a stroke in the next 30 minutes
You're gonna die in the end of this
you have to get the boots first
this game is one of my favorite games
you can just keep playing it and quit
just make a video on it :)
are you the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
Theres a secret in the middle of the room
How do you know if you're in a jerma chat or not?
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY IT LIKE THAT
i just realized that the music is from the original Silent Hill
please try to find a place that has it
You can just go back and get the boots
this is the worst version of jerma is famous in history
I'm gonna go into a rage and get a gift sub
If you're gonna do a game that's gonna be good then you should play the game that's gonna be good
you can just go up there and pick the first one up
they don't even have the last 3 endings
You need to get the boots first
can you turn your voice off for a second
you are the one who died to pinwheel
why is there a girl in the closet
you have to fight the monsters
@
====================
you missed the same spot on the screen you did
you have to say the n word for me
I swear to god if Jerma doesnt show Otto today I swear to god I will unsub
you can only get the money once per day
i love the sound of a tony hawk rifle
i feel like he's going to play the tutorial again
Have you ever played the sniper game?
i want to be a real gamer :(
this is like that one video game where you make a character and then die
You gotta be on the floor with him.
did you see the new emotes? youre gonna have to get rid of them
you can get a new character for that
jerma is the only one who would be interested in a game
I have no clue what's going on LUL
stop trying to get me into your closet
"I can't be late" - Jerma, 9:43 PM
jerma please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
jerma, your gonna get you neck broken like that
You should play the little girl game. it's a very fun game :)
YOU CAN'T KEEP A POG OVER THE VENTURE
i think you have to hold shift to shoot
I think you can get a heart transplant in this game
why do you have a 3 second slowmode?
You know what they say, its true! jermaHeart
How do you not know what a diaper looks like?
how many times have you been in a room?
You don't need to put your head on it
i don't know what you're talking about but you're gonna get really mad at the same time
it's the one with the shuriken attack
THEY ARE BOTH DIFFERENT TRICKS IN THIS GAME
Play the game you said you'd play today
Iâ€™m so glad i got to watch this stream, itâ€™s been fun!
how do you get the most money out of a wink?
you're a man of culture and you know that
this is just the dark souls of dark souls
you need to learn to just shoot every shot
how are you going to clean the whole room
You need to do the same thing with the chests
this is a fucking disaster, not gonna lie
"I can't wait for the stream to start"
why does this game have so much music
you can use it in the right hand menu
hey can you give me a quick rundown on what youve been playing so far
you need to change your name to Jerma985
you can use it to go to the sewer
The game is not even on the stream
Hey , this is a very nice game :)
why does the frog have a giant rat tail
it's a game about music, not rhythm
"Farting and screaming is a normal human reaction to loud noises"
you have to beat all the level in this game
You're gonna get like 6 to 8 hours of sleep
you need to upgrade your character so you can use the healing items
you can do a lot of damage in this game
He's gonna be streaming again, he's not gonna make it to the end PepeHands
put on the "I'm going to kill myself"
do you want to know the lore of the game?
you can use it to go to the sewer
do you have a reason for doing that
my friend said the last game was the best one
i feel like if theres a button to turn it on he cant hear it
you can use it to go to the sewer
they have a special mission in the level
are you going to play as the new assassin?
how many channel points for you to stream LUL
You're the only streamer I watch right now
it's really weird to see you try to do all these combos and then just repeat them
get a hud and put it on your desk
Please do a 12 hour stream
you can get it from the menu
Jerma, have you ever been to a taco bell
I'm not sure
====================
, I can't believe you've gone through that.
I think you can use the star to find the other blue ones @Jerma985
i have to go to bed now jermaPluto
Why does this guy have the same hair as Jerma
that's why you need to play "I'm Good"
I just want to see the last stream
I hope you have a good rest of the stream
Just keep playing games and get a new mic
Just use your right hand to pick up the blueprints and then use the left one to find the blueprints
jerma can you please play the video of me doing this
would you rather have a dude with a hotdog bar rolling down his face than a dude with a gun
I'm so glad to see you here
YOU CAN'T JUST HIDE WITH A SHIRT
This game is about as long as the Simpsons
jerma is like a small child saying "WOW" in a toddler voice
do a tier list of your tier lists
you can't actually get boots if you're already dead
That was a very fun joke! +2
imagine if you just had a bunch of people try to beat it, and you just have to beat it
I don't think you can play this game anymore
That's the kind of music that a doctor would play
how is jerma still playing this game LUL
You can only use the star to find the blueprints
you can move the turrets by clicking the "AI" button
you have to click the buildings
no, it's the fucking star wars thing
how do you know theres no way he's not a liar
you just gotta get a better mouse that doesn't have that nasty old mouse
jermaDafoe do not call me a boomer, i am a boomer
why are you so mad about the fact that you don't have a gun
please play the game I want to watch
Heâ€™ll be in there like a dog
THEY DONT WANT TO SEE YOU DO IT
i dont want to watch this anymore, i dont want to watch this anymore

jermaDafoe "Hey guys im gonna take a piss"
can you please do a tier list of your tier lists
You have to set a waypoint for the blueprints
if you're good at something never do it for free
I hope he does the joke where he has to go pee
I can't believe Jerma is so bad at this game
if you don't beat it I'm going to call the cops
When are you gonna stream the new Animal Crossing?
this is like the worst thing youve ever done
Jerma, you can't just make your own game
this is what the future holds in store for you
Why is the game playing in the background?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
did you know that they use the same soundboard as jerma
You just need to jump on top of the bridge
You can get the blueprints for the blueprints
i had a dream where jerma said i was cute
I'm glad to see Jerma still playing this game
just eat a hotdog every day
it's like watching a toddler learn a language
i wish i could give you money :)
you need to drink a little water
i want to see a jup storm LUL
You can use the star to find the blueprints
Would you ever consider playing Warband? The graphics are good and the gameplay is fun, but I really like the game, and I would recommend playing it.
you can use the star to find the blueprints
i remember when jerma played this game i loved it
This is how you end up in jail
you need to hit the thing that is shooting you
it's not a minecraft mod it's a game that was released on the original xbox 360
I'm so glad you're playing this game. I've been playing it for hours and I've never seen anything like it.

====================
Just because you want to give us more money doesn't mean we should give you money
this is like when you play the game with your friends
I have no idea what's going on but I'm going to keep this message as a reminder to everyone that Jerma is going to die
I have been playing this for 7 hours
you need to play the game at the same time
you can get the voice actor for her
its always 1, but you can only get the voice
i can't believe jerma is cheating on us
jerma you better get to the top of the tower
jermaDafoe I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
why do you have to be so handsome
you are the only person in the world to have a computer
I'm so glad you are playing this game
jermaWalk DREW CREW jermaWalk DREW CREW jermaWalk
You have to beat the first level of this game
jermaOld I'm not going to get a boomer wink
I'm a doctor, not a doctor
you just have to go to the entrance
Oh yeah, this is the last place I'll ever want to live
i have never played this game, this is awesome
It's like that scene from The Mask LUL
I cant believe jerma is STILL playing this
I dont want to be here, i want to be in the place where I belong
if you go to the edge of the universe, you'll find a way to escape
I dont think you can use the "say" button on your PC
if you have a keyboard, use it
did you know that the sun is actually the center of the galaxy
I have a really big pile of all the games you played
Iâ€™ve never seen a game this big before
why are you playing this game, its called Sniper Elite
I'm just here for the chat not the stream
how does it feel to have a penis?
the only thing that was good about it was the only game
i think you have to get rid of the third one
you can get the voice actor for her
i mean, you have to be a streamer
The other 2 were all good, but not the best
my sleep schedule is fucked up, so im still awake until 5 am
I'm really tired of your jokes, please come back to it
I can't believe I'm watching a fucking jerma stream
you can go up and down but you can't move
if you press ctrl+w you will see a bunch of people
im gonna go watch your stream, thank you
how long has this been going on for?
you can skip the first level by just jumping
I wouldnt be surprised if you did a stream on twitch where you just say whatever you want
you can see the muscles in his forehead
Would you ever consider streaming the second game?
are you going to play more than 1 game this year?
this is just a 3d movie maker game
he's never played a game before but he's always played one for fun
you should do a stream where you play a video game
Can you do a backflip like that again?
i just got here what the fuck is happening
JERMA, THE WIKI IS GONNA GET YOU, JUST LIKE YOU!
you need to pick up the ring
that would be the end of the world
What is your opinion on the current state of Twitch?
play this music to make up for the shitty jokes you made
You've been on this game for like 8 hours.
It's ok to be scared of rats
you could be playing Kenshi right now
What's the story of this game, you play as the Devil
You can get the voice actor for her in a few months
can you go back to monster rancher i miss the old ones
i just came back why is he so bad
if you're not wearing a diaper, you don't need to be wearing one
youre not supposed to get that many points
I remember playing this game when I was a kid, it's so fun to watch.
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys! look at this cool guy jermaJup3 jerma
====================
i think you can make the game play out of order
This game is giving me a heart attack
you're not a bot you're a human being
he's gonna leave us with the most boring game ever made
I think Jerma is a bit late to the party
jermaVenus HEY CHAT, WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR MOM
are you sure you have a good day?
it was like 50 dollars for that
I think you need to go to the swamp
just play whatever you want to play
you can do that with the other person you just did
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 you can do whatever you want jermaJup3 jermaJup4
get in the shower and piss in the pool
I can't believe this game was made by a fucking pedophile
I wish he played that with the others
will you play The Surge 2 when it comes out?
if i got a fucking kidney i would be so fucking upset
You've been in a coma for 2 years and you're still in the tutorial.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT GOOD TIMES
it's a good game, but there's a bunch of story stuff that you need to figure out, so its not really that interesting
Are you sure you can just go to the first part of the game?
You can do this. you're the only one who can.
do you know how to make a silent auction?
it was the worst thing ive ever seen
jerma is going to try and cheat the game
jerma you can stop pretending to be bad now
you're like the lord of the rings but for gta
Hey Jerma, do you have any plans on playing Bloodborne?
I can't believe the stream is starting at 1 am for me
I thought you said you'd play Half Life Alyx
i have a friend with a foot fetish
so you'll play Ace Attorney and make a joke about how bad you are at it?
I will unsub if you don't play Ace Attorney
he's gonna be so mad when he finds out he can't play this game
you can play any game in any time
Can you please do a full playthrough of the MGS V DLC?
jerma please play no more heroes 2 its free on pc
You're not the one who wants to go to the mall
why are the people in chat always so mean
you can use a d pad to skip the cutscenes
jerma has to read chat because he's wearing a diaper
you can actually use the cheat engine to do this
you're getting a little too close to the mic
that would be the end of the stream
this is not the only thing you need to know
it's just a small price to pay for salvation
they should have made a new game for it
"Your finger is too big. You can put it down."
Just wait until he finds the secret boss
i saw it in a book and it was the same
You are a hack, you can do anything!
Are you gonna play Half-Life Alyx?
I want to watch you play this
you should play the demo of the game
I'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 2 YEARS. YOU'RE STILL ON THE FUCKING CUBE?
You have to remember that there is no such thing as a normal streamer
this is like a 6 hour game
if you want to be a good mod just put it in the options
the sound effects in this game are fucking terrible
can you not do that for the rest of the stream
that guy has a license plate
you can use the d pad to skip cutscenes
it's like a stealth mission, it's not a very good one
I think you're going to end up playing this
jerma needs to go to the doctor and get his ass
the game has a soundboard of you saying all the words
Is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
how many times do you have to explain this
just dont tell him about the secret boss
I think you're supposed to get the katanas from the other side
if you dont want to watch this stream then atleast stop playing it
====================
Jerma can you please turn your mic off so I can take a pee
oh my god what the hell is going on
if you can get a god tier build, you should probably try this one
It's the same guy who's the only one playing the game
you need to eat more than one shoe
I am now permanently unsubbing from you jermaSun
JERMA NO IT'S NOT THE GAME, IT'S YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A COMA
I don't like how you're playing a game for children
can you play the TF2 Overwatch map?
i just got here why is he playing this
the sound of your hand shaking is killing me
this is what you get for playing God Hand
I'm playing a game called "Nancy Drew" please tell me you have no idea what's going on

You need to be able to see your own face
If you didn't have it, you wouldn't have it
this is the worst stream I've ever seen
I'm going to eat a shoe on stream
do you think you can play as a sea creature
Why does this guy look like a homeless guy?
You know you have to go to the store first
I think you should get a big monitor

I've been watching you since the beginning, I'm still here
you can't just give people a mod badge, you have to put it on
the guy is still here? I don't understand
Can you please make this the new rat movie??
this is like the end of the game
Make a new character and replace it with jermaOneguy
you can see the flag in the top left
You have to get a new memory card
this is the most annoying thing to do
Did you know that you can get a wife with this game?
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS LIKE 3 TIMES
You have to do the voice every time
HE'S ALREADY SHITTING HIS PANTS AND SCREAMING
It's a little late for me, I'm already taking a nap
Hey just got back, is this the "Game Over" stream?
he's doing a 24hr stream where he just streams the whole game
Hey jerma, just got here, what's going on?
i like how the water is just a thick layer of blood and blood isnt even visible
The fact that you have to move the chair makes it sound like you're moving it
you can just make a new character and replace it with a mod badge
theres a whole website that lets you check in jerma
you got the box to check the top right
I'm waiting for my money, I want it NOW
i'm pretty sure you're the only one that's ever played this game
jerma is gonna go live at like 3am
I have a burning feeling that Jerma is going to be late
Jerma, you're the only one I know that's streamed this game
I'm starting to think that you're actually right
the guy who wrote that is a fucking moron
the second one is so much better
You can get a good deal on this game
what did you do to your face
we've been here for 2 hours jermaPluto
I wish I was a zombie so I could eat zombies
I'd rather watch you play this than play Sam & Max.
oh god I want to go to bed
You can find it in the workshop
you can make a bunch of custom characters for the new ones
so what's the story of the last game?
Jerma is really giving a lot of leeway to the stream
oh my god jerma you really are a monster
it's not the game, it's the game
why does jerma look like a lemur now
you have to go to the west
This is the exact same level as last time
you're on a secret mission right now
you need to go back to the farm
do you have any idea when the carnival stream is?
I would really appreciate if you would
====================
?
What do you think of the new Star Wars movie?
Did you know that the Dark Souls series has an average of about 3.6 viewers
You have to go to the bathroom
jerma you have to play the game for us
Jerma you are a fake gamer, look at the stats
You need to get a new weapon
you can do that in another game
have you ever had a bad dream?
i wish i was eating as much as you
is this the guy who lost to pinwheel
He said you have to go into the dungeon first
that was the last time we had to hear that
JERMA I JUST PICKED UP MY RAT
you'll get another 100 if you do it
why are you playing this? its not good
What would it be like to be the president of the United States?
you werent there for the new year jerma
You have to wait for the next timer
I really like the way he looks at the camera.
he didnt die to pinwheel, he was there for the new years stream
i love how theres always a border around the building
he did that before he even came in chat
This game is like one of those escape room games.
i think you should play the new game
theres a fucking "jerma" in the bottom right of the screen
this is gonna be a long stream LUL
it's not a game, it's a stream @Jerma985
you have to get the boots first
i hate that the blue shirt girl has a gun in her bag
I miss the old Jerma that was a good streamer :(
it was really funny when he said he was gonna do the stream tomorrow
it is a great game, but you gotta play more
so youre playing as a lone wolf man
I'm so glad you're finally playing this
Just start the game on this stage
you could use your power to destroy the entire city
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 he can't even Jup without me jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I don't even know what that is but i love it
remember to take your medicine everytime you shit your pants
you have to leave the dungeon first
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2514. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i can't believe he killed that guy with the water gun
HE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE FOR THE STREAM
I'm on mobile and I can't watch this stream
you have to use the boots on the boss
theres a health bar on the left side
hey can you do the voice over for this game please
you're supposed to stop the enemies from spawning
You can't have a bit more than 4 @Jerma985
there's a 3rd person mod for this game called Tiberian Twilight
i just came back is jerma still playing this game
I don't think it's gonna be an hour
you can get the boots by the way
if you dont win you have to play the game again
do you remember when you said you'd play the new Animal Crossing when it came out?
you gotta go back to the tavern

he's gonna get his balls flattened by a clap
This is a fucking Jerma stream. I canâ€™t believe it.
I'm back, can you do a speechcraft joke again?
This is the first time I've ever seen a jerma stream

you can get a really high score with this
YOU HAVE TO DO A FLUSH ON THE GROUND
This is the Dark Souls of platformers
your audio is clipping into your mic
You can get the boots for a lot of items, but they are hard to get.
it's like a side quest in dark souls
that was the best part of the stream
go to the left wall of the cave
this is the worst thing ive ever seen
Jerma is going to eat a shoe live on stream
You need to make the ladder wider, it's easier to make the ladder wider
you can do it with the arrow keys
you can use the other one as a gun
you know you can do it with the arrow keys?
If you're so good at something never do
====================
jerma, would you ever consider playing a game called "The Movies" on stream? It's a great game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is my life story jermaJup3 jermaJup4
can you please do a QTE for the torture room
you can hit alt+t to start the game
You should play the tutorial for the first time
you can stop pretending now and play a game
what is the biggest loser in the world?
What's the best way to eat it?
i could go for a cheeseburger right now
i'm gonna go eat dinner, can you start the stream?
do you eat the new ones? its been a while
Jerma if you do that I will fucking die
that's like asking for a divorce. you're a fucking psycho
Jerma have you ever played the first Diablo 2?
DUDE I'M TRYING TO WATCH THE VOD, I'M IN LOVE
did you just read that you're a furry
Jerma why is your chat so fucking cute
I don't like it, I can't stand it
would you say you're a furry?
It's not a scam, it's a joke
oh god oh fuck it's just a pic of jerma
I think you need to get the boots
you have to get the boots to make the save
jerma why do you look like a sweaty john madden
this is a terrible game for streaming
That's what I do when I'm on a diet
you're about to end up like that one grandma
That's a good way to use a gun
are you gonna play the sequel to this game?
Jerma it's the same guy, you just made him stop playing
just got here, what's the deal with this game?
I hope Jerma doesnt forget the giant rat
this is like the definition of a no-no situation
I want to go to bed but I'm scared
Is this the new Super Mario Maker 2?
dont forget to go to the safe house
You need to get to the top rope
you can turn it off in settings
just play the game now, it's been like 5 hours
you are a goddamn psycho you are an anagram of the devil
imagine being the first person to use twitch chat
I have a question, how do you know
i have no idea what you are talking about
i'll tell you how it happened in the other game
i have to take my time with this
put your face cam on the screen
play the video of the bald guy with the beard
I can't believe Jerma is a fucking Tax Collector
you need to do the windmill to get rid of the gold
I'm an adult and I've watched your content too
jerma doesn't want to be here anymore jermaPluto
I'm going to sleep, wake me up when he streams
you need to clean up the dead bodies
if you can afford a child to play with, why can't you afford a child to watch jerma?
but what if you're the one who gets gifted a sub?
Why does your character look like a KID
I like how the one guy just calls him "Cock"
if you get it again i'll donate $200
why do you want to be a robot
i have a question, how do you know that's not a dead body
its like the game music, its not very good
Jerma I'm pretty sure this is a fake game
you got the last one right, get the bonus
i want to go to bed but im scared
he's going to get slimed with his streamer clout
you have to find the last one
you can use the mini map to find the last one
if you have to drive a clown car it's not fun
im gonna donate you 100 dollars
i think you need to be on the side of the road
I would hate to see this game.
you need to be able to see the
====================
Iâ€™m eating breakfast, do you want anything? :)
i wish i could give bits to jerma instead of a mod
I can't wait for the new Jerma Rumble clip
I'm going to sleep, wake me up
I'm too busy eating to watch this stream
This game is like the worst, it's just so bad
You should get an HD webcam so you can wink
There's a new patch in the game for that
they don't do anything to you, you know
You don't have to do anything now
i'm still waiting for you to play the last of us
you have to have been streaming for an hour
you need to get the disc out
you can tell you're a jerma fan by the way theres a dragon in the dungeon
you're gonna have to do it all over again LUL
I would watch this but I don't want to be a dick
I'll buy it for you, I'm 19
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaComet jermaJup1 jermaJup2
jermaDisgust do you know what a pre-stream chat is
i can make an elaborate joke about this
I'm telling you, if you don't put the music down, I'm going to cry
I can't believe this guy thinks he's better than 5 year olds jermaPluto
would you ever consider playing the original Donkey Kong Country on stream?
jerma you're the only one that can do that
I bet he's going to make it through this
this game is just a mobile game and you're just playing the game
this is a good game, I love it
"I'm gonna eat a shoe" *SNIFF* *SNIFF*
why do you keep putting the words "JERMA" out
I hope we get to see the ending of this game
you're only being mean because you're a bad guy
DUDE IF YOU DON'T PLAY FORTNITE I WILL PISS MY PANTS
you can beat this game with the boots
Jerma is making this game so much better than it has ever been
This is just a continuation of the episode
I'm gonna play this for a while I'm sure
you're making me want to play this game
You can't tell me what to do, but you can tell me what to do with your hands
have you tried getting the coin from the tower?
you can go into the dungeon with the dlc
he's going to get sued for it LUL
you can get a lot of boxes with it
You can skip the tutorials by going to the guide on the bottom right of the screen.
why does jerma look like a villain from the devil may cry series
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ C O N S U M E
youre not paying attention to the game, youre playing as a character
Why is the game making my brain hurt
I'm a professional geographer, you can't do this to me
"I'm gonna run the mile" - Jerma
you are going to die of a heart attack
what if you just said "I'm a baby" and it was the same thing
what happened to the mario sunshine stream?
oh my god youre still playing this game?
The only time you ever get in trouble is if you're in a bathroom
I didn't get one but it was in a porn ad
if you want to win you have to play with the controls
you need to be a sub to have a sub badge
you're gonna get all your weapons, you know that right?
the game is just a way for you to make your character look bad
jerma you're not a real streamer, you're a fake one
if you go into the dungeon, you get a new character, so you can use their attacks
you can't just say "no" to anything
I was there for the first hour and a half of the stream
You should really make a game out of this
imagine having to deal with the kind of shit that this streamer does
what if jerma was like a vampire, but also like a killer whale?
I remember when this was a spooky stream
I'm really fucking happy that Jerma finally has a girlfriend,
====================
you got an actual problem with the internet, it was you
is this the first time you've played this game
i got timed out for saying the n word
You need to stop playing this game
I'm gonna go to sleep, wake me up in 2 hours
Did you know that in the middle of the night, you can hear the music of your own death?
is this a porn game? :) this is like a porn game
I'm glad you're playing this game :)
how many times has he died on stream?
YOU NEED TO PRESS R1 AND R2
this is the worst stream i have ever watched
You're gonna need to build more schools
you got stuck in the same room as him
it's a perfect timing, just like the rest of the game
how long has this been going on for?
Just got back. What the fuck is going on
it's the same guy but he's just a different guy
You can always hire someone else to do that
jermaWalk Don't mind me, just walking my dog. jermaWalk
make sure you have the perfect height
"this is so fucking easy" LUL LUL
play the game that was announced yesterday
you can do a lot of things with the right controller
I think you're the only one who can do it
That's a good thing, the controller is not for you
i dont understand this game, why is it so creepy
jerma when are you going to play the game i want you to play
can you imagine how many babies you could have saved if you had just played this game
You're not a funny man anymore!
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's a great game :)
I don't think he can get the boots
I'm like a baby at that age :)
make a supercut of the stream then you can make an ad
Why do you keep trying to make us say the n word
you have to pay for the tickets jerma
you have to do the normal story
please change your hair to a clown
he's gonna die from that fucking air
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -2. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
You can run over any of the blueprints in this game
You can make your own bread in this game
this is the worst stream of the decade
I don't know why they didn't do that
I mean, you don't really do anything wrong
i feel like jerma is the only streamer I've watched this decade
you need to get to the other side of the map
Did you know that the rats have a human name?
just play the game and you'll be fine
I bet he has a few meals left
I'm not sure if I should just ignore this
jerma is using his third monitor as a double
can you put the house on fire?
you could have just gone to the area you were looking for
hey jerma what the fuck is this game
you can always go back to playing other games
I'm not a fan of any of these games, so I'm not here for the hype
I'm pretty sure he's only like 4 hours in
just do a 4-7 hour stream every day
can you play the video for the rest of the night?
you can break the vending machine, you can do it
I thought it was just a bug and not a bug
you can still buy the boots if you take the bus
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
YOU DID IT YOU DID IT YOU WON
he still doesn't know what a jpeg is
what's the point of the level if you don't see the boss
What is the name of the song?
I bet he says it like "Let's go"
jermaWalk JERMA I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM
I'm so glad you're playing this game
you have to go back and open the chest
can you play the game the next time you have to deal with the bad guys
you can turn off the map if you don't want to
HE DOESN'
====================
You're just playing a shitty game. It's not even that bad
i don't want to go to school with you
You should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
this is the most generic stream in the history of stream awards
You can get a hot dog for free with that one
you don't need a water filter you can just put your hand in the tank and spray it
That's why you got into it, you're a boomer
what is the point of this game if we can't see it
your hair looks like a greaser hair
I have a video of the rat birthday party
imagine thinking that jerma has a "gamer" license
i was just thinking about it and i thought that was a joke LUL
you can't use the right hand side of the ramp
you can't build a city that's not an amusement park
if you dont finish this level im gonna report you to the city hall
dont worry you have a better chance than most of us
You are not a good streamer :(
Just got here, why is he in a sewer?
the gun is the best weapon in the game
we have no idea whats going on OMEGALUL
why does this man have a stalker?
you need to look at the top left
you can find a pretty picture of jerma in the discord
You need to do more to get the boots
im making a video on this joke
the game is about to end right now
That was a good joke, I'm glad you're having fun :)
Jerma, have you ever played any of the zombie games?
What happened to your nokia, you just said you had a "bruh"
You can put a lot of stuff into the gun
Please do a stream of you playing the game
I have no idea what's going on but this is the best one
i am the jerma of the jermaverse jermaGrin
HE'S THE BAD GUY WHO CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
I think you can put your hand in the tank to spray it
jermaSour when you have to pee again
this is a good stream game, i will give it a try
I think this game is just being a bunch of people trying to get money
You have to get all the boxes for the main quest
You have to say hi to the girl
I feel like Jerma would love a better game
you can make your own bathtub from a car
if you wanna play the game take a break
You have to try to get the other guy
I'm so glad you're playing this game, I can't believe you're playing it.
please put this into the same category as the seaman mic
this is the most boring thing ive ever seen
this is the streamer that can't even beat the pinwheel boss
what about the guy that died to Pinwheel
you should do a 24 hour stream
This is the best game ever made by a non-american
I can't believe I missed that Jerma is a Boomer
You can put the gun into the fire, it's called a flamethrower
I think you can't be an idiot if you don't know what to do in the game
you're gonna die in a few days
you have to get the other guy's money
are you gonna play the new animal crossing?
I'm like 30 and I'm so fucking excited to watch this stream
is it because you don't have a toilet yet?
you just need to click the little red icon
you don't have to go back and get the other one
Jerma you can get a little bit of anything
Just got here, what the fuck is this
is this the streamer that doesn't like eggs?
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
you are the best streamer on twitch
If you have a better chance you can do it
im in college can you please tell me to stop being fucking stupid
he's gonna get the damn thing out of him
it's the same thing every time he
====================
you have to let us go of the bridge
What if we get to play as a bunch of frogs and we're all frogs
can you just play a real game like Civ or something
you can tell what he's trying to say
it's the only way to get a new sword
Jerma please play Nier Automata it's a good game :)
HEY CHAT I'M BUYING A BRAND NEW WIGGLE
you can make a normal human with the sword
i saw it on the news yesterday
play something else before you end the stream
I'm gonna make a tier list of all the tier lists jermaJex
Jerma it's not a real game it's a meme
the devs thought you were a bad person
play some of the music from the recent "The Thing"
i have a link to the movie please dont copy it
you're playing this game, this is what you're all doing
You've been playing this game for like 5 hours
I can't believe Jerma would do this to me :(
I have no idea what's going on LUL
How do you not know what a "C" is?
he's like a bunch of different animals right now
are you going to play any other games after this?
i would love if you had a sneeze
you can't even do it in real life
I've been gone for a few hours, what's going on?
can you make the game louder please?
Oh my god what the hell did I just tune into
I have a feeling Jerma's gonna be so pissed off at this one that he'll forget to get the boots
He's the best of them all. He's a true gamer
I can't believe he's STILL on this level
It's a fucking on rails game, and you're using a controller
you can turn off the music in the options
you have to play the game for yourself, its a good game
you can't have fun with people who don't know you
you can have a little bit of the sweet-salty flavor
Just in time for the stream to start
I'm going to beat you to death with my bare hands
you can change your own color in the settings
It's because they're not paying attention to the game
You can find the green guy in the bottom right corner
you can get a lot of damage from that
you can go back to the sewer to get the new sword
you need to beat the game to unlock that
you dont even know how to use it yet
YOU CAN FIX THE RING ON THE RING
you have to beat it to unlock the secret
don't worry, it was an early access game
Do you have a map of the house?
I think you should talk to the mods
I am so glad you're playing this game
i'm so glad you're playing this game :)
imagine how much money you would have spent on a nancy drew stream
I'm still playing this game, can you give me some tips?
This is the longest stream youve ever done, Jerma
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT
Is this the guy who died to Pinwheel on stream?
you need to beat the game already
the reason you're still playing this game is because you're still on this boss
jerma you know you can play a game that isn't a game
Do you think you'll play the new Call of Duty?
They're gonna kill the dog, you gotta take it
I don't know if I'm getting the joke
is he actually in the sewer or not?
You should stop playing this game, it's boring and you know it
I feel like I'm watching a serial killer
if you beat this game i'll donate $5
why is the chat so full of money
you should get a jerma heart to put a smile on your face
YOU HAVE TO FINISH THE FIRST PART
If you're really good at something never do it for free
hey you know what to do :)
Jerma I'm so happy you're playing this game
I can
====================
like its an out of season Christmas stream
I feel like it's the same thing every year
i think jerma is a robot now but he was still alive when he was a kid
I remember this game from like 2012, not sure if it was still there
the one on the left looks like a fucking monster
You don't know how to use a mouse
you need to get the boots to do that
you are playing the game you know what to do
you should play the nier game, it has a bunch of cool map-based stuff
you can use the gun to shoot the weak enemies
Please play the newest Dead Rising 2
you need to go to the west side of the map and explore the jungle area
you should've given them a good reason why you were the best streamer
I've been watching Jerma for a while and I'm already a sub
that's what the game was supposed to be
You can't say you're gonna let it go
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2692. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i'm gonna go to bed, goodnight chat jermaHeart
YOURE GONNA GET A FALL JOKE IF YOU DONT LISTEN
don't forget about the pottery lessons :)
I just got here and the music is so good
I can't believe Jerma985 would do this to me
I feel like this game is a bit too serious for Jerma to be bad at
this is the most generic video game intro
That's why I can't have a normal conversation
you look like you just got out of a car accident
I'm glad I'm not the only one that saw this
I'm so tired of this game. I'm coming back
jermaOld just buy some new ones and you'll be fine
I'm going to have a heart attack
are you gonna play the game or not
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -442. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i miss the old jerma who would just leave the stream
what is the point of this if you know what's going on
This is the one that came out in 2012
this is a really good stream game :)
you have to get the boots before you can level
what's the point of this game if it's just gonna be this game
You need to use the sledgehammer, it's a good weapon
I bet you guys don't even know what a fireman is
I can't believe Jerma is playing as Pinwheel
He's playing the game for the first time in weeks
JERMA YOUR KEYBOARD IS GETTING OUT OF STOCK
Why does he look like a mommy from back to the store
this is the most painful thing to watch
Just go to the dungeon and get the boots
I've never heard of this game, and I know you're lying
this is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
hey you can turn off the music in the options
you can get more troops with this
you don't even need to do that you're already good
jermaOld I remember when you were still a kid
you can buy the boots for 50% off
JERMA YOUR KEYBOARD IS GONNA GET OUT OF STOCKS
The first thing you hear when you walk into a door is "SHOW US"
Can you please go back to the start menu?
You can use the Sledgehammer, it's a good weapon in this game
i can't believe you've been telling people to submit feet pics in the discord
theres a dude named "frosty" that's on the subreddit
you have to get the boots before you can level up
I wish the game would let you choose your own stuff
you can use the sledgehammer, it's a good weapon in this game
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -258. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
please play the game more, it's boring as hell
you can use the sledgehammer, it's a good weapon in this game
you can use the sledgehammer, it's a good weapon in this game
You can
====================
if you're good at something never do it for free
I want to see a streamer play this game.
just say the number of days in a row
you can save it in the settings
THEYRE JUST SAYING YOU WERE THERE FOR THE LAST ONE
why are you going so hard on a game that is just starting?
We have to make sure you don't get a virus
so that means you're gonna play the whole game?
you have to change the game to the gameboy
This is the best stream i have ever watched
This is just a sitcom episode, right?
I've never seen a game so much fun
you can just build it yourself, it's like a modded build
you can beat the shit out of the other dudes
You know how much you want to do?
You have to do the whole thing again
get a picture of the real you
you should play the game and do the voice
do you plan on playing more of the new dlc?
this is just a big-ass rat song
You're just a normal human being trying to get over a divorce
i have to be a little late to watch the stream
YOU CAN TRACK THE SCREEN IN THE CAMERA
can you please do the Hotline Miami bit in full clown makeup
this is a load of shit, it's been 20 years
i cant believe you made this game
That's how you know it's real, it's not a dream
you need to do the "new" button on the top right
you have to hit the light rail
that is a lie, you are the one who is lying
You can make your own Castle in this game.
I feel like you've been playing this for 10 hours
there is a mod that makes it so you can only go into the dungeon and not save.
You just made my stomach hurt :)
you should play all of the games from the last hour
you can't do that in a game
I hope he gets arrested for his crimes
if youre gonna play the game just play the original
you can't just run away from it
I think you have to grab the item from the room
This is the equivalent of a clown funeral
can you tell me a good joke
I'm gonna have to take a nap if you don't finish this level
"I'm not gonna tell anyone, but I'm not going to tell anyone"
I just got here, I know you're not a real gamer, but I'll still let you play the game
you said that and then didnt tell anyone
it's not a dream it's a dream
He's going to go to the zoo and eat a shoe
I don't think you're ready for this
it was the most fun thing youve done in a while
you can make a town in this game
you have to walk up to them, they are there to collect coins
you can add custom music, it's like a mix of your own voices
i thought it was an emote and not a video
you can make a town in this game
You don't need to charge it, just use it
You have to beat the game before you can play another
im so tired but i want to see you beat this game
You don't need to click anything. The whole game is a tutorial.
just go to the elevator, there are no chests
You have to do the whole game
You have to do the whole game now
if you dont stop youll be stuck in the same spot for hours
You can make a town in this game
youre not gonna make it to the end
you can get a portal to the town
if you don't stop talking you'll get deleted
i have been trying to get this level for a while but i cant
JERMA YOU ARE SO SMART AT THIS GAME
Have you ever seen a mouse? Its called a DOU
====================
?
You're supposed to be in the sewer! jermaDafoe
you have to talk to the boss
you can probably go back to the other map
you should just move to a different game
can you do the custom music jerma :)
It's because you killed all the rats
put the stream on discord and just say "malding"
can you please do a carnival stream
just got here, what the hell is happening
we can go to sleep if you dont play it
if you don't go back you will die in a month from the lack of water
what is the minimum for a wink?
if you get a virus in the chat, you'll be the only one left jermaPluto
It's a bit late but I'm sure he'll be back
why does this guy have a gun to his head
Why is he not doing the jump king challenge?
this is like a shitty simpsons episode @Jerma985
Jerma, you're gonna make it to the top of Twitch at some point
I remember when you used to stream, now I'm just a figment of your imagination
you should have a video of yourself in the mirror
"Hey buddy, what's your favorite part of this game?"
I can't believe Jerma's not a real person anymore
the only way to win is not to play
I think you're gonna have a bad time
this is the best version of the game
jerma is just gonna be the third guy
THE PIZZA IS COMING OUT OF YOUR TANK
if you don't know what a jup is, just go to google it and look it up
if you dont beat this level i will have to do the dishes
can you do the "I'm not a baby" joke again?
he can't even put the word jup in the title
it's not hard, just a little slow
You need to clear it with the shovel
You should just put on the new greenscreen
you need to do it again the secret ending is on the new VOD
jermaWalk GIVE US THE STRAWPOKE jermaWalk GET US THE STRAWPOKE
i just got here, what is he doing
you have to walk the dog before you can talk
You're still on the same spot you were in the first place
its like a george lucas movie, but without the actors
I'm actually fucking with you right now, how long have you been playing this
isnt this the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?
you can hit the bar in the menu
you can go to the portal and get a gun

It's a game where you play as a clown
Why are you wearing a diaper? Do you have a scuba suit on?

JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 10 YEARS, GO HOME
is this the same streamer who beat darksouls on stream?
why does he have a huge asshole
you know what they say about a man with big hands
I have to go to bed soon, please keep it up!
this game is like a fever dream
you know what makes me happy? your funny voice
I think you have to have a big boat to get to the boat
oh god he's gonna be a crack head
hey how much do i have to pay you to watch this stream
I was playing the game and got an ad
Why did the narrator just say that like that?
You could play this game for a week
you can use the flashlight to see the sun
Do you think there are secrets in this game?
you should do an entire stream dedicated to these
you have to take the dog out of the exhibit
I swear to god if this is a full moon chat
you can buy the DLC for it on steam
Jerma, why do you have so many hats?
you can see the top left in the bottom left
i love how they all look like they're from a tv show
you need to get the ores first
this is a good choice for a vid
I wish I could give you my address
I can't wait for the stream
====================
you're going to lose so many viewers if you don't do the boss rush
just go to the bathroom and get a drink
You can use the same code for free
you can also sell your meat to your guards for gold
do you know how much I am willing to pay for you to stream this?
i think you can make your own co-op stream

Jerma you've got a lot of content, I'm excited to see what you have planned for the next hour
Jerma you are not a real gamer you are a joke
Are you gonna play the rest of the game?
you're supposed to use the cheat code
how did you do it without a switch
LUL you can do it all over again
its a good way to go for some weird reason
how many points do you have in the air?
just do it, get some sleep jermaHeart
jerma i would play this game for 10 hours
The original version was a better game though
DID YOU HEAR THE SONG OF THE EARTH
if you can get a car, you can get a train.
this game is too much for you jerma
You can use the code to get free rides on your own, it's just a little bit much
he's going to need more strength for this one
your stream is in the backseat at this point
how long did it take you to eat a ghost pepper?
I'm pretty sure that's how it goes for him
will you play the sequel with the new voice acting?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when u smoke crack jermaJup3 jermaJup4
this is the greatest movie of all time
Jerma, you can use the code for free rides on your own
Can you do a new show? I don't think so
You know you can use the code to get free rides on your own?
do you know what a boomer is
you should play the original version of this game
jerma you're just gonna make it worse by playing this
You're making it so much easier to kill them
You can use the code to get free rides on your own
i can't believe you got an actual job
do you know how many seconds it takes you to get a car?
I'm having fun watching this stream, thanks for all the work jerma <3
you can use the code to get free rides on your own
why is that picture of you in the top right?
how can you not know that you're doing it right?
this is a good game, but i can tell its a bit too simple to actually do anything. it's just a lot of dumbass cliches.
you could probably do this on stream
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when u smoke crack jermaJup3 jermaJup4
you know it's a bad thing right?
you can use the code to get free rides on your own
I have a friend who's a fan of this game and he's actually playing it right now
You can do it, I believe in you
I don't know what this game is but I love it
i love how jerma is the only person who actually cares about anything
imagine if the game said you should eat a shoe instead
You know you can use the code to get free rides on your own?
you know it's a bad thing when you've played it for 10 minutes and you're not even halfway through
is this the guy who peed his pants on stream?
can you use the code to get free rides on your own?
I'm trying to get back into the game, but I'm a lazy fuck
I'm glad you're doing a better job with this than Jerma
you can use the code to get free rides on your own
@
====================
I can't believe Jerma just said that he loves women
The sound of him screaming is so fucking good
you should try to make a game about the story
this game has a lot of puzzles too
you have to keep pressing the button
You can go into the room to get the boots
I don't know what's going on in this stream
you can click the pewdiepie to see who is the most popular
you are literally the worst streamer on this site
I can't believe Jerma is fucking DEAD jermaPluto
your name is johnny and you're a pornstar
I'm so happy I got a gift sub
did you know you can go to the bottom of the screen and select "show stats"
you know you're gonna be in the next rumble right?
I'm glad to see Jerma is finally playing a game I loved when I was a kid
it's just a cutscene with a jump animation
this is the dark souls of FMV games
you should play that "I'm not joking" game
Jerma is going to be a full time streamer when he dies
it's really nice to have a chat where everyone can post their favorite parts of jermas streams
i think you can use a shield
you are the only one playing this game
dont say it's a good game, it's for nerds
I can't wait for the one guy to find the secret boss
it's ok to be nice to people :)
you can only get new emotes if you use the "create a new emote" button
This game looks like it would be fun
is the music still playing or is that just me
how do you have a dead cat in your house
you need to get to the big part
it's not a bad game, it's just you can't always pick it
It's just an FYI, you have to do it
if you don't finish this game i'm going to be so fucking pissed
how are you so bad at this?
JERMA YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT THIS
theres a hole in the ground
what are you doing in the video?
you could do this with a little bit of DR2
You can jump onto the other platform
is this the guy that beat DARK SOULS 3 on stream?
I'm not sure if it's still an option, but you have to go back and get a new one
hey guys just got here, what's going on
i'm so confused. what is this game, i've never heard of this game
i'm waiting for jerma to get to the stage
Jerma is the only streamer I watch who can actually play the games he wants to play
he's a fucking psycho he's gonna die
i'm still gonna watch the vod and then eat my sandwich
Why is it always the same fucking sentence
i would love to see jerma play a video game with the voice changer
You can't do it again, I'm too drunk to remember
you'll get more money when you get back
what's the point of watching movies if you don't know how to play them
you have to go back and play the game
You have to get the boots first
I'm going to eat my way to the top of the head
I would have been so good at this game
i want to see jerma play a video game
jerma it's not a wink, it's a wink
I think it's a good idea to have a 24 hour stream
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
you can buy a new one with your channel points
i got my nintendo switch for the vive
i like how jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
do we know what the next game is yet?
you just made me cry in class please don't stop talking
I was gonna ask if he's a man of the people
I am very excited for this game. I think it is very well designed
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
you can go into the room to get the boots
can you do the movie night version?
I hope Jerma can finally stream his movie.

if you're not streaming, i'm not giving you a hard time
you can use the thing you got from the lab to see if it's there
You should have a playlist of your videos
I can't wait for this to be a 10 hour stream
i cant wait for the 5 second clip of jerma saying "lol"

Jerma, if you like this game, play Dead Space

just make it a bigger room so more people can see it
The amount of anger you're capable of has never been higher
you can't eat a shoe if you don't have a bib
you can see the alien's eyes in the bottom left
you're a fucking fucking psycho, you are now banned from Twitch
you need to use your eyes to focus
the real question is why are you still playing this game
did you see that video of the guy with the sandals?
he cant read chat, hes just a horny little fucker
I don't think you have enough light sabers
i can't believe you put that in D tier
the game's music is actually pretty good
remember when you said you'd play something else today?
you have to get the boots and then you can play the game
what do you mean you can't get them
They have a healing item in the basement
is this the streamer that beat jump king on stream?
you got the axe, the archer is dead
You are getting more money than your children will ever get in their entire lives
you can see the alien's eyes in the bottom left
is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
I can't believe jerma is playing this game
why are you still playing this? I left when you were doing the tier list
If you're good at something never do it for free
you are making me very uncomfortable please stop
Jerma you have to stop the cow from starving
Please, you can't just say that like that, can you?
jermaChomp SantaHat The game has been turned into a cult
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaChomp
you have to find a new key to get in
you can make your own item from scratch
What if you had a lot of money and you were a god?
would you consider a stream where you just play the same game for an hour?
play the game in the corner, it's not hard
you have to get the boots first
There's a secret boss in this game
how many minutes until the stream starts?
You just need to wait for her to sleep
you have to go back to the game
use your eyes to focus on the screen
is this what you do in your free time?
you should be able to get the boots in this game
You've never seen a game in your life
did you see the new doom trailer?
you're not even going to beat the first part of Fellowship
@Jerma
====================
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Friday. Around 3-4pm PDT!
i dont know why i feel so bad about not liking this game
play kenshi youre a good streamer :)
it's like trying to make a sandwich out of a pie
jermaVenus jermaJex2 just a chill time to say you're finally streaming
I want to see what the big poo is
how do i make a twitch bot that tracks twitch chat
chat just wants to be happy with jerma jermaPluto
I'm in the bathroom and this is what's happening
this is why you need to make a living
did you have to get the boots
this is the most ambitious thing you've done in a while
is this what you call a puke stream?
is it true you made a youtube video?
jermaSour when you eat a whole lemon in one bite
jermaOld I don't understand this game. I don't understand this game
I think this is gonna be a good stream
just a little bit of that sugar
How do you feel about the game awards?
just have a little light on your screen, it'll help with the dark mode
i want to go to the dentist now
you did the last two, you can do the last two
play the game as you want, you can do this
he was supposed to be early today, but he said he'll be early today
you know, it's not a good idea to try to be on time, but if you're still streaming then do it
this is a cool idea, but what if it's a virus?
That's the most expensive thing you can get
just make the whole thing a vr stream
Jerma is going to be so upset when he finds out this game is rigged
how do i fast forward to the new year stream?
you can turn the game volume up
jerma's getting tired of this shit game, stop
It's a shitty copy of the game Jerma
You gotta keep the tickets for the money
you could have picked a different name to play
jerma is going to get his brain removed
i'm so sorry that you're going through this
i'm so glad i stayed awake to watch this stream
you just need to get the other ones
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3
You are the reason I got into the game.
put a bunch of points into AOE damage
I wish I could hear the dialogue LUL
I wish Jerma would just give us the bad news
i think you have to play the game first
this is the equivalent of being in the office and getting put into the chair
I'm not sure if he knows or not
hey guys i found the jup link but i'm not sure
"I'll make you a big bowl of sugar and ill give you a billion dollars"
do a stream where you can do a funny voice
jermaChomp STREAMER IS DYING TO PINWHEEL AND BEING RACIST
why do you always want to fuck the elderly
you should do a bunch of labo, you'll love it
you have to do it in a different order
I just got here, why is your character so small?
imagine having to pay for a stream on a budget LUL
You can get a new controller with the money you earned.
Why is the streamer so obsessed with the "sexy pose" thing
he's not coming back, he's been dead for 3 days PepeHands
LUL I'm so fucking confused right now.
i thought he was going to say that he was doing the vr
This is the best stream ever, you're the only one that really matters
jerma's going to be in a clown car
how much do you guys like this game
you need to be on the same page
this is just an excuse to get lost in the dumpster
how did jerma even get into the discord?
you need to do it in a different order
you don't have to do it this way
jerma is a game journalist and streamer and he is still losing
jerma i think you got a notification
====================
why do you have to be so short
I thought that was the last one. but then I remembered it was the last
I think you got the wrong choice jerma
i bet jerma is actually a really good singer
you don't need to fight the boss, just talk to him
you can get the boots by the way
Just keep pressing the button and the camera will auto focus
you can get a good steak on the strip
You have to beat the game in the tutorial
that's how you know you're not a redditor
can you show us your feet, haha just kidding
they can be anywhere, if you set them on fire
this is what happens when you don't use your magic
I feel like I'm being watched by a robot
is it a good idea to get that far into the game?
Jerma you should go get the boots! :)
this is just the best thing ever, holy shit
You can play it from the start
is this the guy who died to pinwheel
oh my god youre so bad at this
please play this on the ps2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4G9_m3zDQ
"hey jerma can i have a bite to eat"
you can buy a lot of houses in this game
please tell me you've got this on the table
if you die in the game you die in real life
you can just have the whole thing be a highlight reel
jerma are you going to play minecraft again
This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever seen jerma play this
I wish I was watching this stream NotLikeThis
why are you doing this to us
this is a cool game and you're not even playing it
i have never heard of this game please stop
I'm going to bed now, goodnight chat <3
you need to use the catapults or you're gonna die
this is so fucked up i love it
jerma you look like a big boy
jerma is a dogshit streamer, he doesn't even know
you can use a shotgun to kill the zombies in this game
this is the streamer that died to pinwheel
you should do a tier list of your tier lists
JERMA YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING JERMA YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING
this is the last level, go to the first area
I'm not even sure if he knows this but i'm guessing he's a scientist
If you die in the game you die in real life
he is just getting his steam game ready
I hate that this guy is a fuckin psychopath
Jerma is just a baby character in a human body
You can get the boots by the way
if you want to be a mod just ban yourself
you are a drug dealer, not a police officer
It's like a 1:1 ratio of your face to the game
please use the boots on the floor
did you know you can make your own casino in this game
you can make your own casino in this game
You can just go to the other side of the screen and press CTRL + G to instantly get into it
You need to use the catapults or you'll die
Jerma the 30s are my old age jermaOld
I think he's just trying to escape the simulation
Iâ€™m going to miss this stream. Itâ€™s been 6 months.
if you dont die in the game you die in real life
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFERENT MISSION
I have never seen anything so good in my life
I can't believe I'm watching this stream right now
I think you should play the original trilogy
jerma are you gonna play this game again
theres a save point in the game
oh god oh fuck i'm gonna die of laughter
please dont put the baby into the oven you wouldnt
can you please turn the game down a bit?
jerma you are a fucking weirdo for a clown
when are you going to play the game that's on the eshop
I'm not even sure you can do it
this game is so good its good
hey jerma can you give me some of your money?
you're too tall
====================

 "I'm sorry"
no one is ever going to watch this game
I can't believe you were like this
when will you play minecraft with chat?
They just said "RATS" like the rats song
Jerma you can get the cheats from the vending machine
You can do the first level in this game
did you hear about the new paper mario
it's not the size, it's the amount of calories you burn
my brother beat this level without boots
You're supposed to shoot the headshot with the gun before you use it
dont forget to get the boots for the next day
I'm glad you're playing this game :)
this is the best thing you've ever done
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ MOM IS GOING TO GO TO THE ERIC ROOM
they can't be out of their element, they are just too complicated for me
you should play a good game instead
I can't believe Jerma is a fucking psychopath
I'm not even sure I can watch this stream, this is too much
Hey guys, what's this game called? I'm trying to figure out what it is.
I think you need to get to the new one first
if you just get the boots, you can do the tutorial easier
you know it's bad if it's a bad thing
I'm glad you're playing this game, I was really hoping for a VR game like this
The final boss is the best one
If you don't turn on the facecam we are legally allowed to leave
you should be able to just click the chat icon in the top left
I think you need to be in the safehouse
your brain is too small for the game
this game is gonna be so good OMEGALUL
we're just waiting for you to get the boots
You need to play the game like a normal person
You can do the first level in this game
you have to get in the safehouse, then you can make it in
you should play the game, you should play it
I want to see you play this
theres no way he's actually playing this game
he's gonna die to the first boss
I have a feeling Jerma's going to be a very bad judge of this case.
You have to use the boots in order to use them
he just came in and said he was going to eat the dog
I'm glad we finally got Jerma to do a joke that would be funny and funny for a stream.
you need to make the coffee maker
Is this a rerun or an early stream?
did you know that the last time jerma played this game he died to pinwheel?
jerma when you die, do you just die in real life
If you had to choose, what game would you play?
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
I DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT
Just play the game and see how you do.
You are in a coma and you are trying to get help
you need to get the boots to get the boots
this is the only way to play this game
I'm sorry you have to suffer like this
You're gonna die, and you'll be a little bit disappointed
You're gonna get the boots first try, right?
you are a god gamer, you should know this Kappa
Have you ever considered getting a Switch with the built in camera?
you can switch to a different character and make it look like you're playing as the same character
you're so good at this game i hope you play it again
jermaOld I have a large collection of old games
If you have a vacuum you can clean up the smell of your own mouth
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET THE BOOTS YOU DUMBASS
I want to see you play the Contra Hard Corps OST
Just buy the boots to make the boots
You can get the boots in the safehouse
If you could walk on water what would you do?
you have to go to the south pole
please
====================
, it's like a game of poker, you can win 5 or 10 jackpots
you need to go to the end of the game
I like how you are just having fun with this
i wish jerma was my dad :( :(
you said you would be streaming in the next hour or so yesterday
I'm pretty sure that's not what you meant by "game sux"
JERMA YOUR GARDEN HAS BEEN MURDERED BY A STRAIGHT DEEPFAKE
you guys are so generous with content tonight
You could always just play the game
guys if you arent here in an hour he will have to stream
Jerma, theres a shortcut to the sewer. Look it up
I wonder if Jerma is in chat right now
I swear to god if this doesn't work
You need to use the loot drop from the other chests
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 i don't need anyone i can jup my way jermaJup3 jermaJup4
It's fine. It's just that you have to pay taxes and get a raise
oh my god, you can make an entire city in one stream
I'm not going to lie, this looks like a lot of fun
what the fuck is going on, i just got here
theres a secret level you missed on the right
that's the only thing that's stopping you from doing the wink
did you hear about the new dlc?
so when are you gonna play more kenshi
I'd rather watch you play a shitty game than watch a good game
I think that was the last time we saw each other, I think he died
I think you're gonna have to restart the entire game
You should try the Devolver Digital Gamecube game
he was literally the only one that played it
i cant believe this streamer is here LUL
I hate how the audio for this is so bad
what if you tried to take a picture of yourself?
you have to play the game to unlock it
What do you think of the new Animal Crossing
Jerma why do you keep putting in the lines?
This is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
i hope you do a gta4 stream with the blordow stuff
Dude he's got a big fucking beard, he's going to beat me
I just got here, how long has he been playing this game?
I'm not gonna lie, this looks like a lot of fun
I mean, I was looking forward to it.
you just said you're gonna use the bathroom
It's a good thing you're not a furry
I love how the music changes as you go
are you going to do the pogo challenge?
I DON'T KNOW I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY RIGHT NOW
please play the old games they are worth it
Jerma is gonna die in the first 10 minutes
go to the mines and explore the ore
It's just that the voice acting for this game is kinda boring
we are going to make you do the fall joke
theres a secret level in the bottom right
you're already in the middle of the highway
I hope you can get all the endings
jerma is that the guy who pees in the pool
what the hell is going on with these emotes
jerma, if you're reading this, you're in for a wild ride. you better not let this happen
This is what happens when you don't play good
why is he wearing a hoodie, he's wearing a hoodie
have you seen the new PSA for your viewers?
you could always go back to the lab
just got here, how long has he been playing this?
can you imagine a giant cow that can move with its mouth?
just wait for the end of stream
you're the only one that can do it
is this the streamer that did an entire stream of this on stream?
I was just listening to the song "Moms Making Cookies" and I realized that the narrator was a fucking fish.
is this the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
you have to get the key on the ground
I can't believe he's going to kill himself
its just a bad meme jerma you should just stop
I wish the streamer didn't have to work
make a version of this song
====================
You have to make your own dad from scratch
you're not supposed to do it in the beginning
If you don't beat the first level I'm unsubbing
That's not even close to a full moon
get the dlc for the end of the game DLC
I can't believe this streamer is fucking dead
what about the red guy in the back?
i remember when this was a game jermaOld
Why does Jerma's character look like a baby girl
I like how this game is based on the books
You have to make a character for each of the 9 endings
You'd have to be so bad at it
if you beat this game i will donate $1000
did you ever think of playing undertale with the mods?
What are the chances that you'll be able to finish this?
you can take it from the chest
I've got it on the phone, call me back
I'm too tired to be a mod jermaPluto
You know, I don't think it's possible to watch this stream.
that's a lie, he said he would do it
you could have played that game for the rest of your life
you can't just go back to the sewer
jerma please stop, i'm trying to watch the stream
how many times did you play this
if you dont play it i will eat my own ass
when are you gonna play the new kinect game?
he's gonna spend the next 10 hours on this game
YOU HAVE TO READ THE ONE GUY
there's a cave in the wall behind you
did you ever play the first game of this?
jerma do you think you can do the thing on stream?
you could do a custom song that would make it sound like you're playing
you can hear him laughing at the game
just throw it out the window, it'll be fine
You could have beaten this game in 10 minutes if you just got the boots
i can't believe jerma is addicted to gambling
you can see the sweat on his face
you're gonna be a very good streamer
are you gonna play the new animal crossing on stream
The Wii had a lot of shit back then
why is this game called fallout 76 instead of fallout 3
oh yeah, the "bruh" is the "chat" :)
you have to kill the monster with the d-pad
you can check the stats on the left side of the screen
I don't know what a bingo board is
DONT START THE STREAM OR I WILL SCREAM
is this a fuckin porn game? why are you playing it
I wonder if he can get the ring from the chest
is it just me or is the music kinda fucked up
Jerma you need to do the rest of the game
you need to go to the other end
if you get the boots you can continue
you can beat this game in 30 minutes
this is how they make a movie :)
you were in a boat and a pizza oven
can you give us your best fucking gamer moment so that we can get a better gamer moment
Jerma is a fucking boomer. He's lost his cool
What's the deal with the frog in that picture?
you know how much you hate the game?
you could have done it in like 2 minutes
you can take it from the chest @Jerma985
this is like that episode of spongebob episode where they go into the spongebob exhibit
it was a copypasta so you have to admit it was funny
imagine this is the way you're gonna play a game
i can't believe the streamer who played this game died
this game is like a bit harder than the original
can you do a "I am not a gamer" joke?
do you know how to play mario 64
you can use the shield to get a shield from the shield blocks
The blue one is where the red ones are
That's a real -2 from me for the way you pronounced it.
That's why you're the best streamer on twitch
You're just wasting your time and doing the same thing over and over again
@
====================
It's a good thing you have a haircut
you should be allowed to use your own money
You know you're supposed to do the right thing, right?
You should play the old game, it's really good
why do you have to be a weenie
theyre gonna be gone for a while
I'm gonna go eat dinner and watch the stream
You need to get the right items
I hope Jerma plays on legendary, he'll get to level 5 first time
It's a shame Jerma doesn't know what a spell is
if only you had the boots on your feet
i just got here and he's STILL doing this
jermaWalk oh my god, is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
you can just click on the top left to toggle
i cant believe jerma is actually gonna lose to the tutorial boss
you should play more dragons dogma, its a very good game
youre gonna have a hard time playing it
you have to get to the top of the mountain
Just play a game and let us play
I remember playing this game on my Nintendo DS
the new season of monster rancher is so good
I think the fire is the best part of the game
he's going to be doing the voice at some point
he's just getting the worst of both worlds
I'm a little late to the party, but I'm excited for the carnival stream!
this game is a fucking joke, you can do it
You just have to tell her to leave
the hell is wrong with this chat right now?
I love how Jerma is the only person to actually play the game and have fun
you're going to get a few more people for the carnival
that's not the real Jerma, that's a fake one
you know what you want to do?
You should try to play it again in a couple days
I love that theres a way to read the chat, chat is just a giant paper trail
you can beat this game on stream
jerma please play some cool games jermaPluto
We don't have a real dentist, they're just a bunch of dentists in a room
I want to see Jerma get his ass kicked by a thousand children
i have a good idea for you to play
you need to make the green giant just make a giant jup
how can you not have a good time?
this is a real life scene from a movie
this guy is like a bionicle in a circle
you need to be at least 5 feet tall to use this
YOU CAN TALK TO THE MURDERER RIGHT NOW
how many people have you killed in this game
The difficulty in this game is so stupid
Are you going to play Mother 3 anytime?
that was the most disgusting thing ive ever heard
I can't believe Jerma has a friend who can't even read a second of chat
this is the most annoying game of the decade
If you're going to play this game, please play it!
you have to use a different controller to play it
I'm so tired of this music, please turn it up
i think you should play something else
you know what they say about a bad guy
I thought this was a prerecorded stream
this is a prerecorded stream, you know that?
I'm sorry to hear that, my mom just left me
you know i hate when you do it
I'm so glad you're doing this, I just want you to know that I'm proud of you
You have to get a new mouse, you have to do it all in one try
I love how Jerma is the only person to actually play the game
you can't say that, but you can say it
you can't leave this place, they'll make a new one
I'm so glad I caught this stream :)
I'm a 30 year old man and I'm so excited for this game
you have to pay attention to the game
Jerma if you don't finish the first level I'm unsubbing
you can buy the Tuna Burger from the Burger King
I'm in the same boat as you, Jerma
this is the most boring thing to
====================
i want to get off mr bones wild ride
How can you not like it? it's got candy!
i can't believe jerma is not a top 1000 streamer
it's a good game, but not a good stream game
You should go play Minecraft VR, it's like Minecraft VR but with better graphics and better mods.
If you can't get the coin you have to pay a toll
is he still using the 1st letter of his name?
he's not a boomer he's a boomer with a wii
JERMA YOU CANT PLAY THIS WITHOUT SAVE SCREEN

this is the worst thing I've ever seen
jerma i'm gonna have to go play vrchat
I just got here, hows the game?
this is the only stream i've ever watched
you need to be patient and wait for the stream to start
I'm not sure if you've heard of this game
you should play the Binding of Isaac OST
its a good idea to not finish this game
I bet that's what happened when you fell in the pond
how do you keep getting away with this
this is the only time I can watch the stream
You should play this game, it's got a really good story.
I bet you can't even beat the last game of the series
remember when you said you'd play the game today?
If you had a foot, would that be your name?
this is the only game where the narrator is jerma
"I will go to the store and buy food"
you need to use the special ability for this game
I'm gonna go watch the vod, you're not funny anymore
i think you can turn on the gun by clicking the menu button

you need to go to the bottom of the ocean
im a farmer and i have to work all day
jerma you dont know the word "spore" yet
you know what, the next stream is gonna be a full playthrough
that's what they call a "fake gamer moment"
You can only go to the center of the sun, right?
just because its a game doesnt mean its bad
you got a lot of winks, could have won with a ball
you have to put your facecam in the bottom right corner
you have to do the thing again
they just want you to do it :)
The short streamer is the best streamer
you have to do a few things at once to see what happens
how do you get your hair so long
I really want to see a speedrun of this game
can you play the music in the background
they just want you to do it again
it's because you got a giant umbrella from the ground
Hey jerma, I made some of your earlier videos in mind. Please watch them.
You can get a mod that adds a speed boost to every enemy and adds a supernova
You can just press A on the shield
you just posted cringe, you can post anything you want
jerma has a crush on me, daddy
jerma this is just a dream, wake up jermaPluto
YOU CAN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP
I'm a waiter and I would like to speak with you, if you want me to order your food
you need to eat a bunch of shoes
this is the worst thing i've ever seen you do LUL
remember when you said you would play Ace Attorney tonight
I want to get off Mr. Bones wild ride
the second you beat the game you can do the final mission
You don't have to get into the sewer, just grab the crab
i have never seen that before, but i'm curious

I think he just wants to see his girlfriend
I'm going to have a heart attack if you don't stream today
What if your mom is watching you?
I like how jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I can't believe Jerma would lie about playing a video game
what if the government is watching you
oh my god jerma you can't win this shit
I'm gonna go watch the VOD, I have to watch this for the next 3 hours
its the same as what you just did, it just took a second to set up
I think you can use the power of the light to make the turrets invulnerable to fire
I think he is making fun of you, he is just being a little silly
YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE GAME BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN PLAY
can you explain the lore to me, i need to know :)
i would rather eat than watch this, not play this
You have to have a hard drive
i wish he would just not say it
I dont think this is a good game
jerma can you play the game for a bit, i'm tired of it
You can put the game in the menu
This is a fucking boring game, please stop
I'm so glad you're playing this.
Jerma, you know you're gonna die in the game right?
i hate how it sounds like the door is opening
Can you turn your mic volume down a bit?
You are so good at this game
I don't know what's even going on here
You know what you gotta do, come back to this game
You can find a lot of them in different places
When is the last time you went to the bathroom?
if you can see it, its a black hole
i wish there was a good big iron in the sky
I'm so glad I'm here for this
I don't know what's even going on, but I can't wait for the stream to start!
you can get a lot of stuff from the shop
if you run out of bullets in the air they're useless
you have to get a few more coins
You can use a character to make them into a human
I feel bad for people who have to go through all this stuff LUL
He was also in the spiderman 2 video
why do you keep saying they arent going to eat your ass
I'm glad we got to see you play this game.
Just go through the room and look for a pipe, it's a good spot
Jerma is gonna do a full playthrough of Darkwood tonight
i just got here and I'm already crying
jermaWalk GET THIS GAME OUT OF MY VIEW WHAT I WANT IS NANCY DREW jermaWalk
what do you think of the new sonic movie?
there's a large amount of fan art in this game
can you go back to the other game please?
you can literally do anything with the oscar
He's gonna die in the game, he's gonna die in real life
You don't have a boston accent, do you?
Hey guys, I'm going to buy this book on Amazon for $600.
this is the most realistic game he has ever played
He's a coward, he'll just get his money's worth
is he playing as a girl or is she just a girl
this is the most realistic simpsons game
I can't believe you were so invested in this game
you're a good guy, I'm just a bad influence
You can use the crossbow to strafe jump
I'm so glad I'm here for this stream
imagine having a jerma stream, because jerma is always late jerma
====================
You have to beat the game before the screen shows up
It's a really good game, but not a good stream game
I'm gonna say the n word, please don't make fun of me.
dont get hit by the skateboard, you'll get hit by the skateboard
can you play the 700,000 games ost please :)
You don't have to be tall to get hit by the skateboard
why are you making a jpeg of a person
I'll give you $10 if you beat the game, I promise
there are a lot of shortcuts, its not that hard
you can just watch a youtube video of a clip
you can use the teleporter to get into the store
I'm gonna be so mad if you don't play the song
i just got here and im so confused
why are you so bad at this game
this is what happens when you don't take a picture
please go back to vive and get the boots
dont worry guys it's just a game :)
I'm sure you can do it in the car
you can only hold it for the next 2 hours
i think the timer is over, we have to wait for the next stream
jermaChomp IceCold jermaChomp IceCold I'm cold in here
You need to get the boots to beat the tutorial
YOU CAN'T EAT CHEESE IN A CAR
this is the most thought out game ever made
You should try the new version of Halo
jermaPluto I know you're a big nerd but can you explain the story of this game?
jerma can you please turn the music down im trying to listen to the song
Jerma will you ever play the mystery science theater?
I think you're gonna die to pinwheel eventually
Jerma, you're the only one playing this game.
I'm sure the stream will be good, we just need to watch some vods
i think you have to do it all in one go
why does everyone think theres a streamer right now
you should play the vid of this game
you dont need a jump when youre in the air
The only reason to play this game is because you can play this game in VR
jerma is so good at this game LUL
LMAO I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE THIS GAME
You can't open the door to the second floor
it would be like a fucking shitty third grade learning game
can you say "hello" again i missed it
I'm gonna leave this stream and go watch the vod
You can use a slot machine in this game.
can you not hold a button for too long?
You were supposed to go back in time and save them
it's a bad time to be naked
HES NOT A HEART ATTACKER, HE'S A BEAST ATTACKER
What are you doing, I don't want to hear that
This is the dark souls of video games
is this the streamer who beat dark souls on stream?
This game is way better than the last one
what is the rule to not eat ass?
how many days until you can not stream
i mean you can probably get that in the past
I'm surprised they haven't done a sequel to this game
You're only making it harder for yourself to get a free pass
if you dont beat this level i will scream
you need to get the boots first
JERMA IT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME YOU NEED TO DO IT
why does the water come out of the ground?
I had a dream where a guy said â€œI'm not gonna drink any more milkâ€ and I drank it
this is the worst joke taking more than 5 minutes to set up
jerma is too small to be in the ring
Why is the facecam still on, what happened to the facecam?
it's just a meme, you have to move on
the first half of the game is like this
theres a huge difference between the two though
can you turn your volume up please?
why do you hate the guy you just met
I can't believe Jerma just choked on his own vomit
you have to destroy the satelite to save
they have a giant enemy spider in this game
====================
Forum, I'm gonna make a JUP for that
you can use the cheat to skip this part
try to avoid using the last attack
you got the whole game, just play the game
did you ever watch the video where you ate a shoe
theres a secret level in this game
It's called "The Super Mario Bros 2 Speedrun"
this is going to be a good stream
your build is very good for the most part
Just make a bunch of small trees and make them into a town
im gonna go to sleep, thanks for the stream jermaHeart
please stop, my mother is dying PepeHands
I'm so glad this stream is happening right now
The whole game is a bit more complex than that
That's what you get for not taking the ring
I'm watching this on my tablet right now
jerma will never play the game he's playing
I mean that's what you do, right?
You need to learn the game mechanics first
you can just run over people with it
so theres a 50% chance that you will die to pinwheel
you were in the bathroom the other day
You have to move the jump button in the options
you're gonna get banned for that
it's ok jerma we know you're a funny guy :)
You have to use the bone shield
you can also see where the ball is
YOU CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
would you rather play as the frog or the chicken?
this game is going to be so good
if you do it again you have to do it again
do you have any idea how many people have died to this?
why are you playing this game it's boring
It's not a car, it's a snowboard
You need to go back to the water area
is this the guy who lost to pinwheel?
theyre all 5'8" you're a big boy
jerma is this how you play games with your head
I hope he plays dead rising 2 for the gamecube
I really wish you'd play this more
did you see the new jerma video on the 2nd channel? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-HpE-zP8U
I don't know what to believe anymore FeelsBadMan
He's not gonna be able to catch the fish
jerma's just gonna start his own twitch channel
I don't know what to believe anymore FeelsBadMan
the game is still going on what the fuck
you should play the others, they have a lot of interesting mechanics
I hope jerma plays the "Dude, I'm gonna be a millionaire" video
did you know that jerma is balding?
Do you know how to do a backflip?
imagine being able to click a link in chat OMEGALUL
you can buy a new controller from the market now
It's like watching a child learn to ride a bike
I just got here. What the hell is happening?
just wait til you get to the first part
you can use the bone shield on the floor
can you make the emotes bigger? its too big for you
you can get a better sword from the shop
JERMA DO THE CHARACTERS FOR THE NEXT RUMBLE
you can just use the bone shield on the floor
You need to make a whole pizza and eat it
how much did the game cost you? @Jerma985
I'm sorry Jerma, but you can't afford to do that.
I just want to get out of here
i can't believe jerma is the one that beat dark souls 3 on stream
he's not the boss, he's the last boss
just got here, is this the ending of last stream?
you can change the name of the music, just change it in the options
You should play the new Pokemon theme
just got here, is this game still boring?
it's a meme to keep the chat going
the game audio is
====================
WhyYouTookMyPancake_HF why you want to play this game?
this game is gonna be so boring without the music
You know what makes you hate me? My name is Jeremy.
I'm going to have to take a break, can you start over
why do you keep falling into the lava?
If you put a kid in a box you can get the super kid super powers
you could do a tier list of your tier lists
did you know that you have the same face as a bear
youre just a good guy to bring up to others
jerma is gonna get a whole lot of attention from this
i dont remember this scene from the movie
you can get another gamecube from the lab to beat it
You're gonna need more money if you keep playing this game
you need to be close to the sun
I can't believe Jerma is late this time
i've been waiting for like 30 minutes for the carnival stream
You got a lot of these, you know what they say
it is not the same, the menu isnt broken
please play a good game like sorcery or whatever it is
I hope he has some of the weirdest gamer moments this year
why do you think they put the old people back in?
make it so when you're too high you have a giant rat on your face
you can use your fart to make a noise
That was a great joke, thanks for that one
You should just go to the doctor and do a physical
you can go to sleep now if you want
it's a lie, the world is a simulation
Jerma is going to get his ass kicked by this
You have to find out the truth
this is just like the boston arcades game
Why did you put a bunch of people in a room together?
is it true you have a single ear
do you think you'll play the new pinball game?
the dev was in chat and said "silly game"
you're gonna die in like 4 days
You're getting a little bit old, there's no way you're going to make it this far
I was a 4 year old when I played this game
you need to get to the safe house first
you guys are all mimics, copying everything someone says
i think you can only see what a person is doing
its a meme game, theres a new one coming out
I know it's a joke but can you please not get mad?
you're gonna get 2nd jerma with this joke
you need to be close to the sun
Is this the streamer that couldn't beat a 2 year old
you have to be closer to the sun
If you get 1 shot, you can get 1 shot
If you wanna leave, you gotta get one of those "go to the store" machines
I'm glad you're having fun, this game is really fun
I know it's a joke but can you please not get mad?
i hope jerma has a good day :)
If you're good at something never do it for free
this game is a reference to the movie "The Departed"
you can't do it all at once, you need to do the rest
you have to find the one with the one
is this the part where you die?
I love the way you talk about it
its like the black and white 2 intro
this is just like that one game with the bookworm adventures
you should play the hit and run modded version
I thought it was a game where you fight a boss
you can get it for free with twitch prime
imagine how much money you would have spent on a carnival stream
get your d-pad on and you can do tricks
I'm glad to see the chat is calm and composed
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GIVING ME A DREAM
why are you so bad at this game?
You can always use the Big Book to turn them into a book
I remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream jermaPluto
You have to go left, left, right, left
how many bits for you to play the game?
it's gonna take you an hour to do the puzzle
I can't believe
====================
 HOW DO YOU KNOW
I've never seen a game like this in my life
that was just a joke but youre doing good
You can use the same weapon on the same spot
I just got here, why is there a 10 foot tall man in the top right corner?
you need to go back to the start of the game
jerma you are an egomaniac, you will never be able to play this game again
this guy beat dark souls on stream?? jermaVenus
you should be able to do a jump kick for the first time
he's gonna have to fight the dog in his dreams
this is gonna be the whole stream LUL
theres a save point in the cave
you could have just gone for the head
you have to beat the final boss
he is still in the dungeon room LUL
you guys remember when jerma said he was gonna play nancy drew?
jerma i'll pay you 5 dollars to play this game
Why is the cow so sweaty? I've never seen a cow so sweaty in my life
can you imagine a game where you have to figure out what the fuck is going on
you can get new items from the workshop
YOU NEED TO KEEP PLAYING THIS WHILE YOU ARE HERE
I can't believe he didn't buy the infinity gauntlet
you can get a weapon upgrade from the shop
you're literally the only person I know who actually likes your game, its a meme
jermaIQ "I want to try all of these"
why would you not use a harvester, you don't need to press R to use it
oh my god i cant believe this is a real stream
you need to see the three tracks
I thought you were supposed to be the villain
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead :(
What if the game doesn't work for you and you just want to play with a controller?
the only time i know you're going to get them
can you turn the volume up a little?
Iâ€™ll just leave if you play this game
you just wanted to do the dreamcast voice
DUDE YOU DID IT THE FIRST TIME YOU DID IT
please play something else, it's not worth it
you could just walk into the lava
you need to get the boots to level up
this is the best stream of the year
jerma just go on a rant and you'll be fine
I want to see you get to the top
can we get an H for the dog
When do you think you will get to the end of the game?
get the boots to level up the skills
when you get back to the garden you can sell them for more
this is gonna be a good movie night
You need to finish this level or else you'll be stuck for the rest of the game
theres a way to go to the top
the one with the garfield hat is a good one
you have to get the boots to level up the skills
this is just the ending to simpsons hit and run
can you not just go back to the start of the game?
JERMA YOU GOTTA GET THE BOOTS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
Why is there a giant rat in this game?
There's a gun you can pick up that blocks the tele
why are you using the bathroom at the start of the game
if you want to change the music, go back to the beginning and start over
I'm telling you, I'd rather have a family
if you want to play the game just play it on your own
Jerma I'm going to have to take a shower, can you pause the stream?
you can go back to the beginning of the game
You need to make your own house
I'm so glad I was able to watch this stream
you can just go to the other end of the map
you can actually use it in the menu to see what items are in your inventory
I think you're supposed to be the one with the boots
are you gonna play the rest of the game?
i'm too scared to watch this stream to play the new pokemon game
i have a vod for
====================
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when u smoke crack jermaJup3 jermaJup4
i think im gonna go watch the vod or something
i like how jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I saw a picture of jerma in the news
SOMEONE TELL HIM THE RATS RATS PEE PEE POO POO
You got a good one, you just have to play the game
if you can't handle the game im leaving
JERMA YOU ARE FUCKING BAD AT THIS GAME
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when you smoke crack jermaJup3 jermaJup4
jermaWalk LET'S GO! SOMEONE PLEASE GET OUTTA HERE jermaWalk
I wonder if he can build the stairs
you don't know how to shoot a bullet, it's not your fault
youre the one that thinks that's bad
you have to get the ring from the mister guy
You're just doing a stream where you talk about how fucking bad the game is and it makes you feel bad for playing it.
You should do a poll where we vote for the best stream
is this the streamer who died to pinwheel
there is a mod that changes the enemies to yellow
i'm getting some good news for you
You should have bought the actual game instead of playing the DLC
i don't know what the fuck i just came into
you can just do a backflip for the items
would you rather eat a whole pizza or eat a whole sleeve of oreos and eat it on stream
the first part of the stream is gonna be a bit too boring
He said he was gonna play it today
Jerma can you please turn the music down a little?
jermaOld I remember when I was a kid jermaOld
I don't know what's going on but it sounds like someone is farting
I just got here, what the hell is going on?
You should play this game again and not the last one
This is the most recent level. you didn't even take damage
This is a new level and you're losing to a kid's game
I'm watching the VOD, what did you do
It's actually an actual reference, it's just the "Bowl" logo
I'm back, why is Jerma so fucking ugly?
so you're going to play Team Fortress 2 again?
what a great stream you have to be having fun with these games :)
just have them all spawn at the same spot
how many times did he die to pinwheel
jermaWalk LET'S GO WITH OUR BITS TO KILL THE COW jermaWalk
You can find it in the DLC
you can get more than one house from this house
Oh yeah, I forgot about the one where you died to Pinwheel.
Jerma is just streaming a movie at this point
its because the tree isn't up to date with the game
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I think Jerma is kinda boring for a streamer
i think he was talking about something else
I've been watching for years and still haven't finished it
this is why you dont play games with guns
i want to see jerma in a full bathtub
so this is the best place for people to watch jerma
you can buy the other items from the shop
when are you going to play the new shrek campaign?
i love the song I wish it was this quiet
hey guys i got a new sub :)
you need to put in the green "free money" line
Jerma you need to stop playing this game it's making me dizzy and I'm losing my mind
hey I have to go to work soon, can you pause the stream?
it's like a fever dream, you're going to die in the next hour
You can buy the other items from the shop
I'll get you a bowl of cold ones
This is a remake of a 2002 game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when you smoke crack jermaJup3 jer
====================
 to the second game is still a good game
please do the "I am not going to eat this shoe" voice
I remember when this was a porn game
YOU CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THIS
Just dont be a streamer and play the game as a regular
I mean, he has an interesting history, maybe he can tell us about it?
you can do it, but it's against twitch's terms of service
why does this game look like a shitty bazooka
This is a Jerma stream. We are watching him play this
you have to go to the store, they are closed
you can do it in a few hours
is there going to be a "jerma vore stream"
That's why you don't wear clothes. You don't wash your hands.
you dont need to grind to beat the game
he didn't get a call from the police
what the fuck happened to the other person
I would never watch this as a kid
he's never been in the pre-pre stream chat
I'm gonna give you $100 if you play the DLC.
you can do the voice with a voice changer
you can make any name for an enemy from enemies
what a god of a gamer, he has a HANDSOME collection of games
you have to buy the DLC first
you should play this game in the background
you can do it in one go
please go back to the town and go the other way
if you were to play one of these games, what would you choose?
play a video game with the dog
please stop, this is for your mental health
if you can do it i'll take it
this is the most difficult game ever LUL
You can do it in one go :)
Hey, can you give us a little history of your family?
you can get them at the store
you have to beat the game before you can buy the DLC
You can do it, but it's against twitch's terms of service
jerma I was watching the VOD and I was really confused.
I think I saw this on the news
He's going to kill you with a chainsaw
Why is the wall of flesh look like a toy gun
you can use the shortcut to the right
"you're so tall that you can't see me"
"i have a loisense, you can have it"
I hope the new game doesn't have this, I want this to be too
you can't save that much money on an item
I'm sorry you had to go through the pain
have you tried using the middle mouse button?
please say something funny for me, im bored
LUL he thinks he's going to beat the level
you can just go back and buy the DLC
You can't take the DLC without a HAND SIMULATOR
I love how you just ignore the people who are spamming
You're going to make your own family dinner
Jerma is going to break into your house
Is this the streamer that beat the tutorial boss?
the game will give you a heart transplant
is that why you're always late? :)
if you have a friend, ask him to play you
this is the most boomer thing ive ever heard
that guy is a top 1000 streamer
It's a shame he doesn't have a wife
you know what else you need to have
LUL HE HAD THAT IN HIS HAND NotLikeThis
you need to get more money from the DLC
I can't believe you just killed that guy
I'm so glad I caught this stream, Jerma! I'm so glad you're playing this game!
what if you just have the same name
just get a new computer and plug it in
can you turn it up for me
i think you can only see him from the bottom right
would you rather have a massive enemy spider or a tiny enemy spider?
you're doing a great job, Jerma! A GREAT JOOOB MAN!
if you see a highway overpass, it's a fucking highway
how long has this guy been playing this game
====================
We should all be on the lookout for the next Jerma Rumble
you should play a game with a lot of music
it would be great if you did the voices
can you make your facecam a bit bigger
how does it feel to be the best at the game?
jermaOld i'm gonna go back to sleep jermaOld
I wanna see a video of this LUL
what the fuck is going on in this game
i just got here and I already hate this game
YOU'RE NOT EVEN THE ONE WHO SAID IT
you can just buy the book from the book shop
You're still in the tutorial boss, just let him do it
can we get an emote of your new mic?
hey jerma can i get a quick rundown on the game
You can just hire the guy that sells the person
you're in a room with a computer
you just made my cat fart on my lap
This is the best part of the stream
i think you can just play the tutorial
Is this the streamer who made a joke on stream?
jermaHeart just got here. i love you jermaHeart
Jerma is just so full of life he's got no room to be
you can only get so many points if you do it 100 times
You should stream it on your stream
jermaWalk IN THE MAIN JERMA ROOM jermaWalk
i'm gonna go to bed now, goodnight jermaHeart
the combat is good but the music is kinda rough
You can save it in the menu
this is the most brutal game in the world
You can give us your face when you're done
I really hope the stream ends with Jerma doing a full face reveal.
I bet you can't even beat the last boss
you have to do the quest to get the boots
Do you have any idea how long it takes you to read a book?
He's not going to beat the last boss
you dont have to win every game, just the easiest one
oh my god he's still playing this game
you can change it to a dark theme
You can put it on the desk too
can you tell us a story about your old bones
you're just making it more interesting every day
this is the worst thing youve ever done
You can also just do the quest from the book shop
This is why you don't have a job
I'm glad you guys are having a good day
you need to do this for the next 5 days
YOU COULD DO THIS ON THE INTERNET
you're just making it more interesting every day
is this the same streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
i'm going to be a mod and ban you
you can set it to a dark theme
you can have a full bottle of wine
it's just that you have a big pile of shit on the ground and you can't even take it
you can use the axe to hit the lever
you can turn off the game audio and play a different song
He has a gun on his head
If you do the "just play the game" bit again I'll donate $100
you can put it on the desk too
when are you gonna play this game again
I bet he doesn't even know that's a thing
you can do it with the shovel too
why is everyone in this town a furry
If you die in the game, you die in real life
Theres a door in the middle of the room
I'm trying to get you to play the Contra Hard Corps OST
It's a game you can play on your own time
i wonder if this guy can beat the tutorial boss
I can't believe jerma has a gun to his head
jermaWalk on my way to kill the mongols
just get a gun, and put a bullet in it
I just want to see jerma play the game
can you make a tier list of the tier lists you have?
this is just the game from the 90s
He's not going to get to the 3rd room
you're doing a great job, Jerma! A GREAT
====================
 watching this stream. Just got here and I'm already feeling a sense of dread.
the guy who wrote that was just fucking around in the head with no idea what was going on

Jerma when are you gonna play the new tf2 update?
we need a poll to decide which one is the best
its the same thing every time you play a game
he is going to get his own video
You're not playing the game because you're dumb, you're playing the game because you want to
The end of the game is so much more interesting
Why is the game audio so low? Are you trying to get a mic?

i was the only one who thought it was a good idea to just play the game
Have you seen that one of the old flash games?
"I've got a gun to my head"
It's a game you can play and get banned from tournaments for like 3 years
This is like the Dark Souls of DOS games
imagine being the only one to have the same name as jerma LUL

I'm a little jealous of you because you have a nice shirt :)
if you don't change your voice im gonna fucking scream
Jerma it's the same as the first game
Why is the music so quiet compared to the game
Why would you ever play a game with a controller?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2502. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I just came in, has Jerma ever played a game before?
he's already done with it, he's too old
It's like a day off every month LUL

do you know how to play the game?
this is the best stream of 2019
you can have a ton of health, you won't die
its literally just the same thing, but in every direction
If you want to buy a used car go to the shop

jerma, it's not that hard to make a character
can you buy a new one of those pcs
this is a new leaf game, you can't do anything in this
it's a new game design feature LUL
you have to go up the pipe
your hair is falling out and you are going bald
just throw the controller in a trash can
you need to be able to hit the thing with the right stick
I had a dream that I was the only person on earth with a cat that looked exactly like that
You don't have a money machine, you have a command
jerma is a good actor, he's just an old man
he's gonna be late in an hour jermaSun
I feel like I'm gonna go insane if i get to be in the next 5 minutes
You don't have to beat this game, it's a lot easier than this
It's a big picture, but it's also really good
so I guess he's making a money machine
i'm so glad that the other guy doesn't have a foot fetish
I don't know if he's actually playing or not
i've been watching for like 2 years and i don't have a sub
if you dont want to play the game why are you playing it?
You can just come back and do it again
jermaVenus HE'S BEEN LISTENING TO THE WORD RAGGED
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING WHAT I SAY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY

he's going to get the bad end LUL
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hello jupiter, could you please place a jupiter in the center of your ship jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I think it's because you're a small person.
I feel like theres a lot of weirdness in this game
Put your facecam on the bottom left
it's on your right, so you have to aim the right stick to see
this game is like a 2 hour long tutorial
Why do you look like a furry?
you need to hit the ground
You have to do it all on foot
this is the end of the game
I'm a little sad that Jerma isn't here.
the game doesnt allow you to click on things
you know you can do it if you give us some
dont tell me what to do with my life
I would like to see you play the entirety of Tiberian sun
stop getting mad, your health is important
there are people that can do it
jerma I've never heard of this game but you can use the autoclicker
JERMA IS GOING TO EAT THE SAND WITH HIS EYES
i think youre supposed to do the main quest
jerma can you turn the music down a bit
I can't wait for him to do that
did you know you can shoot your hand with the bow
I thought you were supposed to be a nice guy
he has no idea what he's doing LUL
I'm glad you like this game, you just need to be more patient
what about the other ones in the bottom right?
Jerma, play this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdwfKcJyX8Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWgIy-Wf8v0
I bet he doesn't even own a laptop
i need to know how long this has been going on
You can just go to a random game
I didn't know you were a billionaire
This is just a commercial for a new Xbox

it was just a bunch of weird shit
I'm going to be so fucking pissed if I see Jerma in a year
jermaSun JERMA FORGOT HIS HOMEHORK, HE DIDN'T TELL US WHY HE NEVER GONNA PLAY LISA jermaSun
jerma has a very low IQ and it shows in his streams
I hope Jerma plays a porn game on stream
It was a waste of time to make it
i can't believe you've spent so much time on this
I want him to do more NGU this week
I mean, I don't want to see him play Mother 3 again, but that's just because I want to watch the game
i've been gone for a while and i dont remember this
Do you have a favorite soda?
Jerma, you have been in a coma for 2 weeks
I remember when Jerma was a good boy :(
What is the meaning of life? Are we really going to live?
I'm too afraid to come to terms with the fact that I'm not jerma
jerma you could make a worse version of this game
Dude it's just a meme, it's real LUL
I don't know if you're gonna like it but this game is just so good
I love how it's just like this game
you should try the game that has a lot of music in it, it's called "Jerma is Mad Part 2"
you can play the game with the mic on
I bet you are a fan of this game
Will you ever do a vr stream with etalyx?
Hey I have a feeling that youre not going to make it to the end
HE'S GONNA KILL THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE CAN EVEN DIE
i cant wait to see you play the entire game
I have a feeling that jerma will have a good time playing this game
This is why you dont play with mods
youre supposed to focus your eyes on the screen
can you make it more sus-like so when youre a bit late you can skip
isnt this the streamer that's gonna play Vrchat
you can see where this is going NotLikeThis
why does the headless guy look like a human?
it's a great game but not a good stream game
I'm just here to watch Jerma play asura's wrath
jerma i'm tired of this guy's jokes and memes, please stop
hey can i get an f in the chat for my boyfriend
I think they added a lot of new features, like the ability to buy and sell stuff with your money, but I'm not sure how much you would pay for it
you need to do the part where you die
I'm so excited to watch this stream LUL
I hope he doesn't start the stream with "I'm a vampire"
We should get some more anime music
I'm gonna go watch a vod now, just in case
is it a reference to the new Smash DLC?
why would you eat a shoe in a pool?
I can't believe Jerma died on the 23rd of January 2020
What's the best way to eat a shoe?
Jerma, please start the stream I'm begging you
Did you see the new trailer for the new Half Life?
Make it the best one at the end
are you gonna play the new sims?
I have no idea what's going on with this game, but you can tell me the story of the world in one of your streams
why would you eat a shoe if you have no shoes
this is the worst game i have ever seen
It's a good game, but I think it's not as good as you would make
you can go into the boss room to get more items
you can't do it on stream anymore
You can do it Jerma, you just gotta do it
i have a friend who only listens to fart sounds
I wonder if Jerma will play the new Sonic Adventure games
I'm gonna

i can't believe jerma is a furry jermaPluto
i'm gonna go watch the vod of the vod and see what i missed
LUL oh my god is he still on the tutorial
I have a new job, thanks :)
It's not a dream, it's a reality. Dreams are temporary, you're never one
I'm gonna be honest, I don't think you're the best player on the server
Theres no way he can beat the first level
YOU NEED TO GET THE BOOTS FOR THE OTHER ONE
you're like a fourth of the way there
If you don't get it I'll eat my own dick
You are not an idiot, you're not an idiot
theres a game called "A Way Out" it's pretty good
you can get a fidget spinner in the middle of the street
I'd rather play this game than play the game for the rest of my life
The world record for this game is 86,000
i can't believe you're gonna play this
jerma I have to go to work in 15 mins
It's good that you're not streaming, I'm here for you
we've all been trying to watch the same old stream
You'd have to get the boots to win the game
don't forget about the carpenter's house! :)
How does it feel to have been timed out for like 5 minutes
Are you going to play Mother 3?

Jerma is going to be in the next Jerma rumble
We are the rats, we are your rats
you should play some of the other ones
just get the boots, they do nothing
this is a pretty good game for a ps2 game
This is like the worst game he's ever played
i can't believe jerma has been dead for 4 hours
can you please play the original Nancy Drew?
it's actually a good game, it's just a little buggy
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
just do what you want, but you're not a gamer
Would you rather play this or the game that comes with it?
jerma is going to be here in like 5 minutes
is this the streamer who streamed porn on stream?
chat is too fast to read all the messages
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE SECOND PLACE
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
JERMA IS NOT A MAN, HE IS A MAN ONLY
I have never seen anyone beat this game
You can go back to the tavern and buy the ring
I'm gonna go back to bed, good night everyone
did you make the sound of your own voice?
You need to turn off the game
i hope jerma shows otto for the wii

I think this game is for people with dementia

you have to go to the other side of the map
will you play the new dlc with star?
Jerma please, let us click on the button so you can play it again
don't forget to go to the tavern to get the boots
That guy was the only person who could beat the game
you can't just leave him like that, you have to break his posture
i want to watch the stream but im too scared to go to the store
i'm glad jerma is finally playing the game :)
why did they make this game into a fucking movie
you can just buy the boots in the bar
That's how you lose in real life :)
you have to do it twice as fast
This is the best thing you've ever done

Why did you have to make a terrible joke?
I can't believe they made this game into a fucking movie
you have to click the thing you want to play
You need to do the other side of the map

jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT
you just said that about me, i've been trying to kill you for the past hour
it's the game where you get to shoot stuff in a room with a sniper
You have to watch the movies and make your own music
i feel like this game is for people with dementia
you just got your first sub, that's all you got
if you were in your 30s you'd
====================
I had a dream where you were watching a 3d movie and you could move your head to make your own characters
It's the same thing with this game, you have to remember to make your own decisions
hey jerma can i have a second sub
This is a great game but i feel like im missing something
I hate how much the music is coming from the mic
i'm just gonna go to sleep and watch the stream until you beat it
you can see how much the debt is
I'm not a jerma fan, but I don't think you're supposed to do that
You have to pay him for the carnival stream
can you do the "i gotta do this" voice?
there's a way to make a smaller house and have more rooms
you have to make an account to talk

I can't believe he's never played this game
You have to go to the center of the universe
you have to unlock the hidden cutscene
you could be playing The Surge 2 or 3 right now

I think you can just go into a settings menu
You should play Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic II
do you have the boomer brace? :)
you should have just done it to the other one
put on a video of your own face
you can't just say "turn on the light"
I think the voice actor for this game is a weeb
do you want to know what you're getting yourself into
jermaPluto jermaOld, please help me, it's been 30 years
just go back to the beginning and beat it
you can get a lot of money from selling it
I have a laptop with a screen that is just a fucking TV
can you please change the music to the horror ost
why does your facecam look like you are in a mirror
you got a lot of viewers just do what you want to do, and don't worry about the negative chatters
I'm glad you're not a bot now
just do a backflip with your arms
HOLY SHIT I WAS HERE FOR THE VOD
Your current FunnyPoint score is -442. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
You need to go to the castle
You can get a good deal on the rest of the game if you play all the levels at the same time
this is just the big rat from rat movie
they did it with the gamecube controller
you have to do it in real life
This is just like the game with the "I'm a streamer" face
play the game this is your last warning
why are you so obsessed with these old videos
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
Please play the original Dead Space
You have to get the boots first

I have a big pile of toothbrushes and a bunch of toothbrushes.
I would like to see you try the game
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
im gonna pay you to do this
why do you guys keep using the word "poo"
jerma this game is so good play it
This game is literally a sequel to The Movies

====================
you have to save him in the other rooms
how the fuck does it feel to be a nancy drew streamer
That's the first time you've ever read my chat
I'm sorry I missed the part where you did the joke
That's what you get for not doing the secret boss
I don't think you can get all the levels
I'm in the middle of watching the game :)
is this game worth getting over it
just get a corsair and stream it for a week
hey jerma, i just got back from the dentist, would you mind asking what my teeth smell like?
i can't believe jerma is here, hes playing jump king on stream PogChamp
if you dont get this game, i'm going to have a stroke
what the fuck did I just tune into
can you turn the game volume up please?
youre the only one who got in this mess
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
You're about to be in a coma.
i'm not sure what you're talking about
oh boy i can't wait for the new jerma rumble character
you guys need to make sure you have the right kind of socks
what if you were a child and you died
you're like a baby in the first movie
i remember when jerma wasnt a gamer FeelsBadMan
if you don't beat this, I'm going to be disappointed
YOU CAN WALK ON LAND WITTH THESE LEGS https://imgur.com/2aJHPR
I am so fucking happy that you are playing this game
I think you can't be a weenie
i think the joke was that you were going to die
you can skip the first level if you want
i want a clip of jerma saying he's gonna play jump king
jerma what the fuck is wrong with you
theres so much to the game uwu LUL
there is a small area in the first level where you can find the skeleton
is there any way to skip the last boss?
do you know how many people died to pinwheel
just go to the tavern and look for the ring
He has to play jump king again
You're a scumbag if you don't know that
You're a bad guy, you have to learn the lesson
what is this game and why are you playing it
the only way to beat him is to get hit by a car
this is what happens when you don't play videogames
can you make a vase of your own face
he's only gonna get to the end of the game
will you do the whole game now
I hope Jerma shows us the steam page
oh my god this is so boring LUL
did you know that jeremy985 is voiced by mr bean
you can skip the first level if you want
why do you keep doing the "I'm too busy" joke
you're the only one playing this game
you have to get into the teleporter room
go back and get the boots
this is the most fun thing i have ever seen
I'm so glad you're playing this game
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
i just realized the devs made this game
you cant get a sub through twitch though
It's like a speedrun, you don't have to go fast
jerma you need to have a lot of money to afford the rides
I'm waiting for this stream to start so I can finally say "no"
you can get a free ipod nano
Can you explain this game please? I'm not a good enough gamer to understand this game.
This is like a 10 hour long game
i had a dream that jerma was an anagram for me and I was like "I was a little kid"
they should make a new game every now and again
that's not a chad joke, that's a genie
this game is too scary for you
why is this a human in a robot suit
I can't believe you're a fan of the show <3
play some doom ost please,
====================
This is the greatest weapon in the game
jermaChomp I FUCKING LOVE THIS STREAMER I'M SO CLOSE TO A BERMA JERMA
HE WAS ON THE BUS WITH THE BROTHER
The dog needs to be taken care of
you arent gonna get the good ending
YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT THE DRAIN
YOU CAN GET YOUR OWN THING FOR FREE
jerma is the only one who doesnt have the funny points
The only way to win is not to play
you gotta do the old man voice
How does it feel to be a 9 year old?
i think theres a secret boss in this game
You're gonna be so mad if you play this
How long until you die? How long until you die?
this is just a ripoff of the fireman game
I wish I had my way with you
they are going to get killed by the BOSS
you're gonna get the BOOTS for the FOREHEAD
Have you ever played the Amnesia series?
you can literally do anything in this game
the only way to win is not to play
Why is it so hot in this town
we're in the middle of the woods right now
you can't do anything but that for like 2 weeks
I'm so glad I caught the first stream of this game
you can use the cheat engine to make your own city
are you going to play RE2 remake
DONT BE SAD JERMA YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE
I have to go to work soon jermaPluto
you're gonna need a lot of cash for a shoe
Jerma has been live for channel is not live
This is the most un-jerma shit I've ever heard
if you were to make a movie, which one would you watch?
you just have to play it again
I think you need to go back to the part where you fought the red
you're the only one that gets to play
i think they're just gonna keep making the same level
I dont know what this is but I love it
Please turn off the music, I'm trying to watch the vod
jermaWalk chat lets all walk to the jermaWalk
you're the one who thinks they are better than you
you have to wait for the light to come in
please do the "I'm playing this" voice again
this is a good game, if you're not enjoying it
You know what they say about a good game
I wish there were more than 1 stream
You should play the Simpsons Game for the Nintendo Switch
I can't believe that Jerma has a gift sub
I don't think he knows what a keyboard is
i wish there was a way to play the same game twice
is there a game on this stream that is just the same
we got an extra like 15 minutes
What if we have a cold and we are all dead
do you have the "Find the Giant Enemy Spider" mod installed?
you can just go to a random place and kill them
I'm sure you have some of the same problems
you can turn off the music in the menu
i'm so glad i caught this stream, thank you for being so humble
I'm sorry guys, I was trying to warn you about this but it's not gonna happen :)
I'll be honest, this game is pretty good for a game called Terraria.
"You know what would be funny?" - Jerma985
you can do that with the camera just say
I just realized you can only hear a fart
this is so good it's making me puke
I think the mods can help you out with that
what if we kissed in the Jerma chat? ðŸ˜³
I can't believe jerma is a furry (Shy)
This is a good game, this game is good
Your mom got you a clip of her face being naked
You can get a full playthrough of this game on the Dreamcast.
I'm glad I caught this stream, thank you for being so humble
how can you not like it? its got candy
I love how Jerma985 is playing this game
jermaOld can't wait for the stream to start
if you dont go
====================
 is like the end of the game
what about the ring of fire in the room?
I think you can give the money to a friend, but if he doesn't give it to you he can't
the map has a death counter, it's not really that hard
I'm so glad I missed that one, it was one of the best streams ever
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when u smoke crack jermaJup3 jermaJup4
why are you wearing a backpack? youre gonna get crushed by a car
why not have the camera show you're wearing a backpack
jerma i have the game now play the game
I'm just gonna say it, it's a good game
the ring of fire is not really worth it
You need to be a sub for the subs
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
this guy is gonna be in the next rumble
I think you have to get a huge shield
why does it look like you are playing a mario game
I'm glad you're back to being a boomer
I'm going to be so mad if I see you at twitchcon, chat jermaSun
they are just saying the game is fun to watch
I'm still in the tutorial. Can we get some background music?
That was a fucking fireman reference I can't believe it
hey jerma how do you feel about the clown car incident?
I have a full month of my life ahead of me
you have to do it in the air
my guess is that this game is about to be released
theres a lot of money in the game
he's a fake streamer, he's not streaming jermaPluto
you can eat it if you keep it in your mouth
I know you can do it. I'm just saying that.
you can actually play as the cow, it's just a tutorial
if you didn't know, that's why you're so short
if you have to leave, then do it yourself
I'm going to go on a walk. I need your help.
we'll never know how long it took to set up
jermaOld how do i get a sub to you
it's not a game, it's a set of rules
i wish i had a fursona like jerma
you can bring your own food to the party
YOU WERE IN A ROW ALL ALONG
you have to pay to play, the game has a mode that let you play as a cat
Jerma when are you gonna get the boots
you can use the ring to make the normal dungeon easier, but it's not really needed
What are you going to do about the controller being out?
you're going to eat your own ass if you dont
What if there is a way to get into the crystal cave?
It was in a game called Heroes of Might and Magic 3
If he's not here in 2 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
You have to buy the other rings
I'm so glad I was here for this
I'm glad to see Jerma play a game that is actually fun and has good music.
that's why you have to eat a whole sleeve of oreos to get the coin
Oh my god it's going to be so bad
go to the options and enable sub mode
you can get an autograph from a lady at the carnival
make a new one with the same voice actor and everything
i love how youre actually having fun and we are all laughing at you
You don't have to look at chat
that's how you make a bad joke
I can't believe I missed the first part of the stream
you can hold alt to see the time
I'm not even sure how many times he's been talking about poopbutt
Jerma you can do it, just make a mistake and you'll be fine
how many times has jerma said he'll play ace attorney
Jerma do you think that the streamer will be more entertaining if they have a whole house
the devs of this game are really cool and they made this
I have a letter from my brother that says "I'm the FBI"
@Jer
====================
 It's a bit hard to get into
you can do the voice over of a speaker
what was the last thing you did before you died?
i just got here, why is jerma in the middle of the desert
this game is going to make me vomit
"Is this the guy that killed Santa Claus on stream?"
I'm here to watch you play this game :)
can you turn the sound down i can barely hear you
you should do a face reveal stream where you just do a face reveal with your mouth
Did you know that there's a total wario ware 2 mod for this game?
do you have to pay for the stuff in the store?
jerma you've been in a coma for over 6 years
i don't think you can do it
If you don't do the mission, you're a coward.
why does he look like a horse with his hair falling out
there's a cheat to get past the tutorial
stop using your teeth for a living
you're only supposed to kill the children
you can go through the whole level with this mod
This is what happens when you don't shower jerma
I'm a pro at using the shovel in a minecraft house
i cant believe you got a sub, thanks
Hey Jerma, can you tell us how much you have eaten?
if you dont beat this game im gonna watch your stream
I'm going to come back to this
It's a lie. I was born in September of the same year as you
I'm not gonna lie. I'm so scared
YOU DONT NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS
i wouldnt be able to sleep if you streamed
jerma i just got here, what's going on
Why does this game have the same voice actor as the one in spy kids
I'm going to eat my ass if he plays this game
i think it's a fisrt thing, like the government
this is your friend, go to the bar
He was the guy who got the carnival stream
You have to do the tree quest
Jerma I'm so glad you are playing this game. I love watching you play it.
I'm gonna be honest, I hate this game.
JERMA YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE BEST PART OF THE GAME
I'm gonna watch this stream and cry if you don't play it
DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
I just got here, is this a game or something?
I can't believe Jerma's Twitch Staff is still alive
I just got here, what the hell is going on
you can just tell us what to do
I'm sorry for not liking your stream, it was very entertaining and very bad
would you ever consider playing Doki Doki Literature Club?
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer play games jermaPluto
hey man I think you can play some of the levels better, but I think you're a bit too slow
JERMA YOU GOTTA PLAY THE FUCKIN THING AGAIN
The real reason to stop watching is the chat
He's going to get the fuck outta here
Jerma is a big fan of those types of games
I can't believe this is the last stream of the year
you're not even close to the end
Do you know what a game is
when you die you have to stream again
i think you just want to be in the mood
can you turn your mic volume up please?
this is a lot of work to make this game
they're just mad because you didn't pay attention to the game
hey can you please not be in the bathtub
you have to go to the other side of the map
Jerma what the fuck is that fart noise
i hope jerma plays a good game today :)
You need to get to the other side of the map
Please look at the picture of the star, it's the end of the game
I was just here for the first stream and I'm so confused
did he just put on the game again?
you can go to the other side of the map
is this the guy that beat dark souls on stream?
i got a gift sub in the chat
@Jer
====================
OR THE COOL JOKE
I WANT TO HEAR IT I WANT TO HEAR IT
it's like a jerma version of the "I'm gonna play this game for the rest of my life"
i remember when jerma didn't play with chat
You gotta play the new Call of Duty
he was too good at it to be a good player
It's a good idea to check the box first
If you had a knife and you cut them open you would know
Why do you have a small backpack on you?
can i get a 2 for the money
I hope you're ready for a whole month of this
you can give him a "shelby" in the mod menu
i wish i could be a mod :(
you got a little too close to the mic
is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
if you can get a full head of hair off of a woman, you're a good artist
I can't believe jerma is a big liar
the thing you didnt get was that you needed to get a new one
I'm still waiting for the moment to say that Jerma is in the next Rumble
I can't believe Jerma is gonna lose to Pinwheel
YOU DONT NEED TO TAKE THE BULLET IT WAS IN THE BULLET
Do you know how to play the game?
this is like a pre-recorded stream of the last stream
You can still go to the beginning if you want
"I'm not gonna be able to do it"
There are different ways to do this.
they are using your voice actor as a prostitute
what the fuck is going on with you
He's not even wearing a shirt, he's just wearing a backpack
this is a big game store where i can get a $100 discount on a $50 game
you can put the axe on the cat
jerma play the game again and do the "I'm too busy watching TV to play this" joke
I'm not sure why you're still here but i'm still here because you made me watch Jerma
You don't need to be in the mood to eat ass, you just need to enjoy the game
Just go to the gas station and do the "trying to buy a soda" mission
You're the only person I've ever seen talk to who cares about me
why do you look like the demoman from Team America
Play the rest of the game in the meantime
You're a good streamer. I'm proud of you.
if you do that you're a big dumbass
you need to go back to the lab
I just want to get off of this game
I really don't know what the fuck is happening
it's gonna be a 30 minute stream, you know that
I dont think this game is meant for that
Just go back to the slot machines
You can use the same keys for the same mission
What about the guy who said he's going to get a sub?
You have to pay him in real life
why does he sound like hes being held in a chair?
theres a whole section of the game on steam
you missed the ability to add items to a weapon
I just got here, what's going on
Make a new account and use this one
you are a professional in the making @Jerma985
The enemy is just a mouse and keyboard
its like that old game with the silent hill game where you kill the guards and then you play as a Scout
why are you trying to murder a scientist
use the special move that lets you get to the top of a building
You have to go through the door to the right
This is the guy who beat pinwheel on stream!
he just wants to kill you so you can make him your slave
you can do a raid in the next area
you could just go to the fountain
do you know what a penis is?

I like how chat is saying "no" to the fact that jerma is a furry
jerma theres a damn sniper in this game
that's a lot of backseating but i dont understand it
I've never had a really good burger in my life

This is the same game as the last one.

I think you can use the arrow keys to move them
Why does this guy look like he's from the movies
I'm trying to find a movie that's in the public domain, but I can't find one on youtube
you know it's bad when you get timed out
you dont have to play the game
i'm not even sure if it's possible, but you're probably the best streamer on twitch right now
if you can't beat the final boss im going to cry
i think its because of the big guy
I feel like this is just like the GameCube
jerma what would you do if you got a cat
it's the same guy over and over again
This is the only way to win. I'm not even sure.
you're just going to make it to the end
You can do the quest by standing on the trow and holding the trigger
You can't get a cat if you don't have a wife
can you make a better video of this game please?
I'm so glad you're not playing the game
I can't believe he's still on this level
theres no way theres a gamecube controller
Why is your webcam so blurry? NotLikeThis

you can just go to a different game
theres a whole video of it on youtube
You can get an xbox 360 controller with the gamecube version of it
can you try a different game please :)
Jerma can you tell me to stop playing this game
It's a scam, we have all been lied to

it's not a bad game, it's just not for you
Jerma, do you have a plan for when the stream starts?
You can also get a dragon from the magics
you can throw rocks, but you cant pick up dead bodies
Just take your time and pick the best item
i want to be a mod for this chat
They're all rats, they're all the same
jerma is too small to get the boots
will you be playing the new game with us?
The only reason why they arent getting a new house is because they are too small
you have to do the same thing every time

you're in a house with a garage door
You can't get another thing from the box
do you know how to play the game?
Are you sure you want to continue playing this?

make the tarp a secret room instead of a room
you can also say "dude i think i'm gonna do it"
imagine having to pay for food at a restaurant LUL
I hope you're doing well Jerma, you're good
hey can you go to the bathroom already?
what is going on with this streamer? I just got here
I don't think he can do that now
you need to do it with the other guy
You need to take a break, we're trying to watch the game
jermaPluto it's been years since Jerma's last stream
this is my favorite stream of all time
jermaPluto I can't believe this streamer is FUCKED
you can use the D pad to move the camera around
Jerma I am so glad you are playing this game
you need to play some games for that
Theres a secret room in the other room
i am a ghost and this is how i die
i would not want to be in that
you dont even know what a super stream is
you can use the D pad to move the camera around
i hope youre having a good day
play the music that plays in your head
If you're good at something never do it for free
this is gonna be a 12 hour stream
you can use the D pad to move the camera around
what if you were to play the game and you're a horrible person
I think he's having a bad time right now
Jerma this is the worst thing I have ever seen you actually play this game
this is the best thing to happen to jerma
you can play as the other characters in this game
you can use the D pad to move the camera around
i know what you mean, i'm just a child
You should have just done the whole game instead
You are in the middle of the desert.
i remember when this was a viva pinata stream
JERMA YOU JUST DID A BAD JOKE ON STREAM
i love your streams, just hanging out here
do you ever see the guy that eats a shoe?
Is this the streamer that beat the level of SEXX ON STREAM?
Theres a secret room in the other room

====================
if you want a really good word for it read the last book in the series
i thought you were joking, i just had a dream about this
JERMA I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SCAMMER AND NOT A GAMER
You could probably beat the game without spending
you have to do the "star wars" voice
there is a very good feature on the main menu
put a bunch of words in the options
the best thing about this game is the difficulty
just stream the game for 6 hours a day
you just made me buy you a pack of gum
I'm going to make a Jerma account and post the links
this is a chill stream it's not like you're having a meltdown
Theres no way he isnt a total fucking idiot
if you can't eat your candy you're a fucking disgusting moron
I remember that episode of Duck Season when they were still called duckdogs
can you turn down the music pls
Jerma you have to buy the DLC first
can you play this for another hour?
you have to do a secret mission
JERMA I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SCAMMER AND NOT A GAMER
I can't believe jerma's been playing this for 5 hours
You should've just let him play the game
This is the worst thing you have ever done
you can get a pro controller by selling the same one for a few bucks
I can't believe Jerma was finally able to do it
you don't have to jump if you can't aim
can you say "where the fuck are these guys"
you can get a 3rd party controller by selling the same one for a few bucks
I bet you beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
I'm going to beat you to death with a baseball bat.
do you know how to play this game?
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE GROUND
you're going to die to pinwheel? jermaVenus jermaVenus
I'm about to watch the end of the stream, can you pause the stream so I can take a pee break? Thanks
oh my god i love this game so much
I remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream jermaPluto
he didnt think to do that to us
can we get an update on what he is streaming
I'm getting kinda tired of this stream, I'm so tired
you can play as all 5 characters at once
the amount of effort required to make this game is insane
You can't save your pets, you have to save them all at once.
You can't beat this game on the hardest difficulty
I just got here why is the character name just a picture of a guy doing the mambo no 5 dance
What if you put a bunch of stuff on your character's head and you're the only one who gets to see them?
You don't even have to grind for the DLC
play it on stream, theres a secret ending
did jerma ever say what he was playing?
Jerma I'm so glad you're here. I'm gonna miss you.
It was a good stream, the stream was good
What if you dont want to play with us?
hey guys i just got here what the fuck is going on
is it just me or is your mic a little low?
just got here why is the audio fucked up
stop being so mean to him he has a wife
I DONT KNOW WHY I'M SO SHORT AND HARD RIGHT NOW
You have to put in a picture of you with the fish
I'm trying to figure out why you never do it
can you do the karate one with the fidget spinners?
Can you please stop being so mean to yourself please
your going to be a millionaire in 2 years
how does it feel to be a professional actor
The game is just a shortcut to play with your friend
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KILL THEM AND THEN YOU DIDN'T
if you don't do it I'm going to eat my own ass
I think you can change the difficulty
I am a real one man gamer, I have two streams to watch, I will play

you need to get a new one in this game
I think the vroomer is the thing
you can use it as a vive webcam

You can buy the rod and use it for the rod

I mean, you can do it right?
how did you even get into the water
DONT LISTEN TO HIM HE'LL DIE FROM THE COSTUM
You know I'm something of a scientist myself
this is a really bad part of the game

you know you can just go to the bathroom
Jerma I just got here, how is the game so bad?
hey jerma can you turn on facecam so we can see your huge chin
You have to put the binoculars on
just remember that you can make them all your friends with one of your regular pawns
This is a crack stream now, don't let this distract you from the fact that you've been sober for the last 8 years.
you should play an actual good game like sekiro
you can get a new one in this game
you need to go back to the village
jerma is having a rough day, he said something about having to stream for like an hour
This is the worst game I've ever seen
just go into the room, and use the gun
i don't know if i like it or hate it
You can go to the store and buy a new one for the rod
you need to collect the ladders first
what if you had to buy a new one
you can put it on the floor and it can be put back in the same place
You have to do the whole game again
@Jerma
====================
oh my god i just realized this is the beginning of the game
You can get a scottish accent from this game
I think you have the wrong controller
are you going to play the new Animal Crossing?
I'm going to listen to this for the rest of my life
"Is this the guy who died to Pinwheel?"
you need to make the little girl into a human
I'm just trying to say that you're my favorite streamer, and I hope you're proud of it!

you need to go into the dungeon
you need to play a level where you do the "do what i do" challenge
what do you think of the new Star Wars game

If you want to be a good streamer you need to be passionate
please keep saying that the stream is starting, it's starting to get really weird
This is going to be a fun one
i can't believe jerma is gonna lose to pinwheel
I can't believe you've been playing this for 5 hours
YOU HAVE TO GET THE LEECHES FROM THE OTHER
i was gonna say that but the lack of subtitles makes it kinda hard
you can put a couch in the middle of the street
you're too old for this shit game
put your face cam over the other guy's
the only thing i can do is not watch the stream. I watch you all the time
you're gonna have to do that every day

I'm waiting for the stream to start.
I'm so glad this game has a huge army of zombies
hey jerma you can do a little karate to increase posture
i have no clue what is going on
Jerma I would like to take a moment to appreciate the fact that you are actually playing the game and not just watching a few clips of you playing it
jerma i need you to leave this stream
You are a very talented actor, not gonna lie
you guys think jerma is gonna do a bit

You don't need to do it again

Are you gonna be playing Nancy Drew anytime soon?
You should make a 3d model of the cow
i think you could do the full run of this game
what are the chances of getting a wink?
how do you have a black belt in the art of fighting
is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
DUDE YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THAT LIKE THAT
theres no way he's gonna win this fight
would you rather eat a whole sleeve of oreos or eat a whole sleeve of oreos
this is like that one game with the red guy
do you know about the "Pee" story
JERMA THE DOGS ARE COMING AND THEY'RE DYING
I don't have enough points for a wink
You should do a full playthrough of this game
Jerma you need to stop playing this game, it's been 15 years
you need to check the boots to get the boots
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.
I've been gone for a while, why is this guy playing a game
is the game just as bad as the actual game
I really want to see you play this
You didn't even do a single step, you did that
is this how you found out your parents were divorced?
i remember this game was so fucking good
that's because you can't complete it with the special
can you please beat the game already
you gotta get the boots to make the other one
you just missed the best spot in the game
you're gonna die from the fall
this is like a rickroll but it's not funny
I can't believe Jerma has a PS2 and Xbox controller
you can beat this game with a normal mouse and keyboard
you're the only one that thinks this is funny
You can play it on the go
This is like that one game with the red guy
You can buy it for 500 at the lab
This is just like the dark souls of video games
you can get the boots by beating the game
hey jerma can i get a free wink

I like how you're playing this with a controller, you have no control over it
This is the worst stream of the year
I'm gonna get a kidney stone thanks to this stream
I can't believe jerma is a fucking psycho
it's a brand new game that came out in 2015, it's called The Surge 2
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 the only true jupper is a true jupper
You have to go back to the other one
are you sure this is the right game?
you should play the "The Moo" song
it was a great game but it was too long
please take a break, i have to go to bed
I'm sorry you have to do this.
you can just change the game to a different game
just make the table the size of a mountain

this is what happens when you don't give him your social security
Don't forget to save your combo points for the final level
play the game, it's a good game
jerma you're not gonna win the game again
We know you've played this game before, can you explain it?
i have a really good clip of that
It's funny because when you get a certain amount of coins, you get a random number
I'm going to be so disappointed if Jerma doesn't get the boots
You can do it, just be patient and don't worry about the health bar
you could make a game with the wii mote and use it for a video
do you have any idea how many times i've had the same thing happen?
Jerma do you ever wonder why you're so bad at video games?
i hate the game and i hate this game
he is gonna die of old age
I love the soundtrack of this game :)
you can just mute the game audio if you want
You can't just talk to us like this
I'll pay you to not talk to me
Iâ€™m gonna get a bunch of these and put them on my shelf
YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT THE TV ON
I just got here, why are you wearing a backpack?
it takes a while to get used to
you should get a chainsaw for the first level
you can actually get your funko pops in boston
you cant get a D rank in this game
I'm here for you, not the game
jermaOld remember when Jerma was in his 30s
"This is what happens when you don't give me your social security number"
just came back, what the fuck is this game
you can now sell them for like 50 dollars
you are the one who makes all of the rules
I'm gonna get a bunch of this stuff
you should have put the zombie infested part of the map
you gotta be on the left side of the map
I'm so glad that Jerma's going back to VR
oh my god the look on his face is so fucking scary
he's trying to make the right choice, but he doesn't know what to do
I have an idea for a stream where jerma is just playing jump king
but what if jerma was a bad person?
are you gonna stream with etalyx? :)
It's been like a year since Jerma got addicted to it
you can buy the boots from the shop for 100%
theres no way i could do this
I hope you have a great day, Jeremy
You can get the boots for the boots
JERMA DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?
Why did I get timed out for a minute?
just use the menu button on your mouse
you can turn off the game audio and play it again
this is like the first time ive ever seen that happen
Would you say that you are a furry?
jermaChomp ðŸ“£ ONE MORE, ONE MORE, ONE MORE
You have to play the first one again
he's so full of energy he's so hot
this is not the game i was expecting you to play
you can buy the boots from the shop for 100%
that is just a lie, you need to read the manual
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I think you can use a grappling hook
jerma, how do you think you would do a 24 hour stream?
If you die in the game you die in real life
I have to use the bathroom, can you pause the game for a second?
You can't get the boots in the first level
You can't even get the boots in the first level
Is this the streamer that has a mental breakdown on stream?
why is the sound effect of the game driving me nuts
You can get the boots for the boots
how many tickets to get the boots?
have you heard of the new name, jerma985
====================
i'm in a really long hallway and i can't get up
he could have gotten the boots, he's a top 1000 streamer
I can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
I don't think he's actually wearing the same shirt
It's not that hard. It's just that it's too easy
he's going to play the dlc if you keep playing it
i can't believe jerma died in a clown car accident jermaPluto
you have to pick them up and throw them into the river
that's the point of the game, to not be afraid of anything
i wanna see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into
how are you so bad at this game
the person below has a very unique sense of humor and style
I just came back and he's still playing this?
I got a new job at a local gym and I've been working there for the last 6 years and it's not working out
you can also just turn it off in settings
theres a tutorial on how to use the mr. bean mod on steam, it's just as good as the official one
how can you be so bad at this game
I'm on the phone with Jerma, he's trying to convince me he's not streaming
You don't have to do this in real life
I'm not sure if you're still here.
you can check the left side of the screen
theres a big, well-known company called Aerospace
"the only good thing about the west is that theres no way you'll be able to get the final mission to the final boss"
You can get a refund if you did a bad job
I'm gonna go watch the VOD now, just to catch the end of the stream.
how long until the next stream? jermaVenus
How are you so bad at this game?
I'm going to go to bed now, Jerma. You're all amazing and I love you.
hey jerma, do you know the name of the one guy who made that noise?
please say pogchamp in a very deep voice
i know that feeling, and i want you to feel it jerma
you can have them all as pets if you want
you have to go back to the start of the game
you have to go to the room
I think you can get another one of those
You should do a stream where you just talk to yourself, like a 3 hour game
You look like a total war vet
he's not going to get to it
This is why you don't play the Monkey Game
you can go to the store and buy more stuff
he's not going to stream this game he's gonna be playing it for an hour
is this a lot of effort to be sure
This is what happens when you don't play a good game
I don't like the new Jerma IRL update
he's just going to be staring at the camera for an hour
jermaIQ he's like a clown who needs a clown nose
It's a bit late but this is the best game I've ever seen
I'm going to bed. I have to catch the end of this stream.
I bet you can't even make it through the tutorial
go back to the farm and open the chest
Jerma I think you need to watch this movie
Why is the chat just like this every time you stream
i was here when jerma was born jermaPluto
I can't believe jerma is fucking dead :(
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -192. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
What the fuck is wrong with you guys
Jerma you're a 33 year old boomer, what are you doing
theres a door in the middle of the room
I made a level based on this game
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
theres like 3k people here right now
I'm getting flashbacks to when Jerma ate a shoe and then died
you can make the shark carry you
you don't need the boots, you can just get the boots from the town portal
imagine not having a keyboard on your keyboard
put it in the background of your dream
Jerma what
====================
you look like the kinda person who eats a shoe
its not the same with this one but its good
why are you pretending to be bad at the game?
I'm gonna take a shower and come back and he's still streaming
That's a normal sized human being you fucking monster
just like the old days, when everyone used to pay at the gas station and they just stood there waiting for the next minute to be delivered
just go to bed now, you'll be fine
you can get a new character if you beat the game in the next chapter
You're in a mood for a bit?
I'm glad I got to catch a stream with you jermaHeart
When are you going to play any more of the From Software games?
I can't believe he was a waiter at the saloon
jerma you can just go to the menu and pick something else

I'm so glad I got here early jermaVenus

jermaOld i have no mouth and i must scream

you're like a zoomer but you're 20
You're not supposed to do that, I'm calling it
you can do a lot of damage with it
you can use the crossbow, it's a good weapon.
DONT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT CHAT LUL
you can use the crossbow, it's a good weapon.
Just came back, what the fuck is going on
You're getting a lot of views, stop being bad at the game

if you're gonna do it, do it on stream
theres a secret ending if you kill the lizard
You can use the crossbow, it's a good weapon.
I'm trying to get a job at a local elementary school, and I don't have any jobs, and I'm not a boomer

The mods are much better than you could ever hope for.
i thought he was going to say what he was going to say
you gotta do the story missions for the endings
I'm a mod, but I don't like the way you say things.
I'm going to watch a jerma stream in the chat
He's gonna ask if you want to go to the carnival.
It's not a good game for Jerma, but it's a good game for chat.
the music was in the middle of the movie

It's gonna be the entire stream, the one guy's gonna be there
Jerma you're gonna make me bleed to death

Did you know that you can go into the abyss and kill everyone?
JERMA YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GONNA KNOW
Jerma is going to get fired for the fact that he was born in the year 2020
YOU GOTTA PICK UP THE TRAFFIC FROM THE GARAGE

I can't wait for the next stream LUL

You'd better start a new game soon. @Jerma985
Can you do a backflip on stream

when you're a kid and you have a shitty dog
I think I'm gonna make a new account
Jerma is gonna start the stream with a t-pose
You can make the second level with the DLC
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's got a memory of that time when Jerma was in the hospital

I'm sorry Jerma I can't see your stream

i wish i could watch jerma play with a computer jermaPluto
i am so fucking excited for the carnival stream
You should play the new Animal Crossing when it comes out on Switch
If you wanted to, you could've bought a bunch of funko pops instead.
Jerma you just got a booger in your mouth
you got one of those boogers out of the way
you have to do the fall joke
you are so bad at this game
I thought you were gonna say we'll never get to the end of the game
didnt you say that you'll do a half hour stream
I remember when I was in the hospital
Jerma you look like you're in a fever dream
Jerma is going to get a second arm
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 we can legally consume his skin
this is the most boring stream ive ever watched
Jerma has been live for channel is not live
I hope this is a good game for you
i have no idea what you are talking about
This is what happens when you put a bunch of chemicals in your mouth that makes you not scream at the chemicals
you can sell the tickets for real money
there is a new fortnite map, it's called "fortnite warband"
You need to go to the bottom of the screen
that's not a weasel it's a bad omen
jerma if you had a burger youd be eating it right now
this is the worst stream i've ever seen
jermaWalk GUYS, I'M THE GUY, AND YOU GUYS, I'M THE GUY jermaWalk
hey jerma can you help me build a stairlift?
so this is how you get the boots?
jermaPluto jermaHeart its okay to hate on jermaHeart
I can't believe this streamer doesn't know how to play video games
I can't believe he's never played a real game
jermaJup3 jermaJup4 this is how we treat you
You're just pretending to be bad, what's wrong with you
theres a secret room in the first level
jerma, you can finish this game right now
You can sell the tickets for real money
Play all of them and see what happens
jerma why is your hair like that

you can play as the griffinsteed character
Jerma is just gonna give it to the toddler
theres a secret room in the first level
Jerma please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
I remember when I was a kid and I loved it
why do you have the same voice as that guy
you could have just played the game instead of watching the vod
this is the one you killed and took his soul
This is gonna be a good stream LUL
it's okay to hate on jerma, he's a cool guy and he's never going to let you down jermaHeart
I can't believe you've been subbed for 9 years, it's almost been 9 years since I last saw you, I'm so sad :(
Why would you
====================
it's too late, you're already a top 500 streamer
that's why they don't have a time limit
It's going to be a wild ride, I'm excited
I just realized the guy who made this game was in chat and not the game
jerma, you should play something other than this one.
i hope he doesn't start the stream with this game
That's just how it is in real life
it's the only game where you're not a real viewer
i like how jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
he's gonna play this for the entire stream
"I'm just going to beat the shit out of these guys"
I would be so mad if I knew about that
i feel like i'm in a fever dream
You need to pay for the tickets, you're not going to win
you can build an army with them
when are you going to play Black & White 2?
You can go to the other area to get new boots
you know you're supposed to watch your own stream right?
jerma i have to go to work soon
If you see a fish you are cool
I'm really glad I got to see this game play out
did he just say that he's going to play the rest of the game?
jermaIQ A streamer is not late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. jermaIQ
i hope he's playing this game and not kenshi
you have to tell us the ending
the only thing i know about you is that you're in a basement
Oh, it's just a fucking dino's life simulator
i'm gonna get so excited for this stream that i'll be really confused
i want to play this game with my dog
play some of the simpsons hit and run
You have to beat the game to unlock the ending
This is what happens when you dont play with your friends
JERMA GO BACK TO THE WIND AND GET THE HIGH GROUND
Jerma this game is an allegory for your addiction
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's really fun
jerma, you need to stop being a dickhead
theres a good video on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1X_V3n2cE
play the halo campaign on stream you'll love it
its true, we are all on the internet
I have a clip of him saying "oh shit i got a gift sub"
you're not gonna get 100% if you don't get to the top
you're not even close to a 10 hour stream
i wanna watch this stream in the shower
The music in this game is very good
you dont have to do anything anymore
i miss the old jerma that would start the stream and say "this is the best part of the stream"
put on the speedrun music please :)
jermaDisgust i cant believe they got me jermaDisgust
You need to get to the next area first, you need to get to the second one first
do you have a full size dong?
This game is like an elaborate cover up
I bet jerma could beat this in one try
i just got here why is he playing this again
that's why you don't wear that robe
what about the 50 bucks you spent on the carnival stream?
make sure to never use the controller
jerma is just a small, dumb, and ugly character
i dont think theres a single person that doesnt like a little bit of that
i think you just have to find the most common song
I have the same feeling. I'm a little old but it's not that old.
jerma is gonna be the first person to ever stream on twitch
Is this going to be the last stream of the night?
I've been gone for a bit, what did he say about the carnival stream?
We know your stream is a comedy
he's going to play the game and not realize it
you know you can get like a 20 dollar rent for the house
jerma has a full time job and is still not streaming jermaPluto
What is the best way to make a pizza?
Theres a guy named JERMA985 and he makes all of the rules
YOU CAN BUY

jerma i think you're gonna need to play this game again
jermaSun jermaJex2 YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS LEVEL FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS
Do you know how to play The Ring
you don't have to say anything about it
that's why you play this game in bed
If you get it at the end of the stream, it'll be the 100th wink
you can do that with the cheat code
Jerma, if you want to win a free iPod you have to pay for a membership to the Apple Music club
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
hey can you finish this level, thank you :)
this is just the rat movie all over again
Jerma how can you be so bad at this game
I think that's a good way to do it
JERMA YOU SAID YOU WOULD PLAY THIS ON STREAM
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
guys its the game that makes you lose your mind
this game has been out for a couple months now
this is just a bunch of fake videos
you're gonna get a kidney stone and die
Jerma you should have put a fence around it
put on the music box please :)
if he doesn't show up in 15 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
i'm going to go to bed now. bye jermaHeart
i wanna see what jerma plays in the next movie
It's a joke jerma, but it's not funny
this guy's gonna make a full moon joke
I'm watching a vod, did you hear the new Star Wars?
you dont need to be a gamer to have fun
i want to see the gta casino LUL
jerma would you like to play the harry potter game?
jerma I'm going to get you a $100 bill
Jerma is trying to tell us about his colonoscopy
this is like when you play the simpsons hit and run
what is the difference between amazon and chainsaw
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1114. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
"i know what you're talking about i just wanted to tell you about the funny thing"
i thought it was gonna be a funny moment
Jerma is going to have a breakdown from this
it's been like 20 minutes and he's already lost it
you should play the game where you play as the sniper
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SLIPPER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SLIPPER
Thats why you have to go through all the bosses
What is your favorite type of cake?
why is it always the left one
you are not going to beat this game, this is for the fans
this is what the new house looks like
you can do the same thing with a gun
you can't even beat the main game
jerma is going to lose to pinwheel LUL
I'll just let you do that for me
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
He's going to be back in 15 minutes
You can't be a mod if you don't have a sub
imagine if you had a dog that could speak
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
what was the last movie you watched before you drowned?
This is the best stream of 2020, and I'm not even joking
you know you're gonna need a lot of time
can you do that weird face joke again?
hey jerma do you like the orangutan video on your youtube
just got here, what's going on?

====================
you're supposed to put a tree in the garden
put the ring in the basement and you'll unlock it
he's just gonna do the whole game again
you dont have to do anything, just go and do it
he has a gun in his hand, he is going to shoot the wall
HE HAD TO DO THE TRIPLE GUY IN A ROW
youre right. It's not hard to do, but not so hard to get
I had to sit through like 3 hours of the tutorial
You can do the rest of the game in this mode
when you go to sleep, wake up, go to bed, and you'll be back in the game.
this game is going to be the greatest stream of all time
I bet you guys can't even beat a blind magician
you have to pick up a random item
you can use a scroll to see items in the game
why are you playing a video game
You have to use a manual for this
Dude, I can't believe I've watched this stream. I can't believe it.
This is the same voice actor as the guy who is in the movie The Mask
you're gonna need to do another tutorial
This is your first stream, you're supposed to play the game
jerma can you please play the game, it's been so long
you are a little bit out of it
this is so sad do a song to cheer up chat
you can buy the lute in the store
I can't believe jerma is actually a child
You should play the simpsons hit and run
Make a funny face and say you're jerma
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING A GAME WITH THE THING
we could have had a stand up comedy
THIS IS LIKE THE END OF THE SONG
you have to use a scroll to see items in the game
hey jerma can you please start with the fart joke :)
you can use the scroll in the menu
that's because the majority of the population is in the basement
you need to see the ring
It's not a horror game, it's a horror game with a lot of potential
you can also do it with your hands
I have never seen a game so unfunny it was hilarious
can you play a little bit of roblox
the amount of money you have is enough to pay for you to play this game for 5 hours
this is the only reason why i have subbed for 2 months
you can use the scroll in the menu

Hes just a baby yoda clone now. He died
I was hoping Jerma would say something and then we wouldn't see it
you can use the scroll in the menu
he can't even get past the first part
you can do it with your hands
I'll give you $50 to turn it off
the only good thing about this game is the music
I think the sims 4 is coming out soon
You can do it with your hands!
im a dog you can do this jerma
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT, JUST TOUCH THE CAMERA
how do you not know how to use a lightbulb

you just got a new haircut for the first time
you need to use the restraunt place
He's gonna give up when he sees that
Jerma why are you playing this? You're not a real gamer.
theres a hole in the ground in the back of the house
Dude can you play the new cooking mama game?
I want to watch you play this
it's not a fluke, it's just a coincidence
theres a hole in the ground in the back of the house
you can use the restraunt place to get the restrains
The game is hard to make sense of in VR
you can move the restraunt place to get the restrains
you can use the restraunt place to get the restrains
i dont know why people want to talk about politics
i'm pretty sure that's what it is in the title
is he going to play the other game
You can use the restraunt place to get the restrains
You need to kill the other guys first
can you do an interview on the internet
you can move the restrune place to get the restrains
this game is just a black mirror on steroids
I just got back, is this the same level?
he needs to get his gamer chair
i am so glad i was here for this
I've never been in a jerma stream so I can't say anything
jermaWalk WE'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR 30 MINUTES jermaWalk

it has a hole in the ground in the back
that's what you get for saying "bored"

he cant even play the game anymore :(
you need to see the rest of the game

Jerma just got robbed and murdered by a stranger
You can use the restrune place to get the restrains

I know you're a professional gamer, but can you do the voice for me please
I just got here, why is he making a pizza?
Just wait until you see the face cam
I just
====================
i think you should turn off the face cam
you've got a lot of stuff to decide on
I just got here, what is happening? I just got here
You look like a psycho at parties
you can run from zombies if you take too many hits
You're the best at this game <3
is that a fucking sword in your hand
I made this video for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4WXn3p7p3k
You are a good person to go to jermaHeart
you can tell how much money jerma is making when he goes to the gas station
why is he using a gun for a gun
the last mission in this game is a survival mission
You could probably be playing this on PC
imagine not having a dick in your butt
You can't get mad at the same level twice, you'll just get mad at it twice
if you go to the moon you get a special chance
If you don't get a sub, you're officially a weeb
this is the last level of the game
you know you need a computer to play this right?
why is your character so short jerma?
I don't even have a DS, what the fuck is this game
You should've gone to the bathroom earlier
you can't really buy anything in this game
Jerma you have to play as the two characters in the game
theres a bunch of enemies in this game, you can't do anything
you can unlock the option to stop
I know you can't do it, but I'm going to tell you that if you do it again it'll be awesome
why did you choose the one with the heartstone?
you can go to the other side
how did you not see the face cam?
I love how you can hear the music in this game
Do you have the dualshock 4? you don't need it
I'm still sad that Jerma won't be playing Planet Zoo PepeHands
Is this the guy who died to pinwheel
you've been playing this for like 3 hours
you need to watch more movies now
it's like the exact same thing but it's a different game
Jerma is too smart to understand the game
"I'm going to show you my peepee"
play the snes mini at the same time
i like how they put it in the bathroom
you're supposed to get a body double
are you going to play the whole game?
you have to press the touchpad to do the stuff
theres a bunch of enemies in this game, you can do this
you're playing this game like you're a teacher
its not a spoiler its a spoiler
i hope he gets the boots so i can become a mod
He just turned into a freak freak that's the whole reason he was alive
get the gourd that you are holding :)
jerma you gotta get the boots to beat this game
I think he's gonna die in like 2 minutes
it's a little too cold in here
so you can do the other two
You can't keep doing this it's too much
you'll be too late to do it jermaSun
I'm so glad I'm watching a stream with Jerma right now
You can just walk in front of the car to get out of it
heres the picture you took of yourself https://i.imgur.com/SjK2P5.png
you can do it, don't worry. :)
you can do it. don't worry. :)
you can do it, don't worry. :)
you need to turn off the face cam
i'm going to sleep now, good night
Do you know how many hours of your life you have left?
Jerma you've got to do the tutorial now.

====================

i think it's like a 1-2 hour long joke
get a vive and do a stream on it
jerma you know it's not funny when you say it is
"I'm not a baby" *spits in your mouth*
i have been here for almost 2 hours
You can shoot the flashlight to show them
Jerma is the only streamer that doesn't know how to play the game
do you know how much you paid for this?
theres no way he's going to stream until tomorrow
jerma you are the best streamer on twitch
you should try playing the newest DLC, it's free
I don't want to watch this stream anymore
is he doing the nintendo direct or not
this is like the fallout 2 scout voice
I love how you keep playing the game
That's what happens when you're late Kappa
I think you need to do some more work
you were supposed to do a bit earlier, not later
You can use the Y in the left column, it will show if you're in a zone
you missed the wii u game i'm so sorry
do you think you'll play DR2 again?
jerma has been live for channel is not live
I love how the red circle is his height
when do you get the boots? I think they're super useful
what is the premise of the game
I thought it was a joke, but it's actually a serious question
He said "i want to play it but i have to pay for it"
You're the best streamer and you'll never have a problem with it
I've never seen someone so good at a game
It's only a copypasta, it's a book
hey guys, i'm back, what did i miss?
you can get a good house if you go to the library
This game is so boring to watch, can we just watch a movie
There's a small window on the right side of the screen
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream
You're a legend for playing this game you can do it
do you think you'll ever do a co-op game with etalyx
You can play as a moth with the fire wings
I wish you could have a serious conversation with her
It's like a 2 hour game and still bad
JERMA STOP PLAYING THIS GAME, IT'S CRYING AND SCREAMING
I got a bunch of them for my birthday and it was super fun
imagine if your mom gave you a pizza
i love your streams but im going to bed
you can't have a child, you need a god
you've been on this level for 2 hours
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
The new ad is just a man yelling at a woman
Is this the guy who got stuck on a rope?
theres a fucking mule in the back
I'll give you $50 to shoot the cat
JERMA YOU'RE THE BEST STREAMER AND YOU'RE MY FRIEND
hey can you say what the name of the song is

do you have a life insurance policy?
if you keep moving you can just walk
can you do a 24 hour stream
I think you can use the â€œi got knocked down a few timesâ€ option on twitch.
Theres a light in your room monkaS
I just got back is he still doing the tutorial
do you think you'll ever play Dragon's Dogma again?
You need to learn the "more" skills to get the final boss
they did the voice acting for this game
What would you do if you got attacked by a giant cow
The new update is coming soon, don't worry
stop playing this and play with the game
jerma you're doing a great job! you can do this!
When is the part in the movies where you die?
you have to find the key to get back in the sewer
Jerma is a kind of baby :)
you gotta make sure you don't get caught
I think that's a little too much, but it
====================
what's the best way to learn how to play a game?
I love the idea that the game is a simulation of real life

Jerma is a serial killer, why does he make those noises?
This is a real puzzle, you're gonna be stuck for hours on end
are you gonna play the new Animal Crossing?
you could make a video game out of this
What the fuck is wrong with this guy
The game doesn't matter, you just have to find it
You should play the minecraft ost, it's so good
It's fine, you can keep playing whatever you want
How much did you pay for this game?

I'm surprised they have a shield on the left
You can get the right ring on the fourth floor of the castle

you can get the right ring on the fourth floor of the castle
jermaWalk I WANT TO GET OFF MR BONES WILD RIDE jermaWalk
If you can't beat the game, you're not a real gamer
This is the worst game Iâ€™ve ever seen
You are playing a fucking game, itâ€™s not even a real game
That's why you have a hard hat

Hes gonna go live on his own time
you can get the right ring on the fourth floor of the castle
Can you put a fence around the city?
You are going to die of old age within the first month
I'm glad that the first phase of this game is actually really hard
I can't believe Jerma is actually playing a game
This guy is the guy who beat Jump King on stream
this is why you don't have friends
you have to do a whole voice
the game is fine if you want to play it

That's what you get for not playing Minecraft
The people you talk to are so nice

this game is a total mess i'm so glad
HOLD ON A MOMENT, I'm gonna go watch Vinny's stream

you shouldnt be doing this to yourself
====================

jerma is a fucking loser and doesn't care
theres a secret room you missed in the bottom left
YOU CAN SKIP THE FINGER ON THE DUCK
jerma you can play this game for the next hour
you can only go through the door that way
you have to take off the controller
I've been here since you started this game
Make it so you have to type it in chat every time you play
hey jerma can you please finish the game
theres a gun on the wall behind the table
It's gonna take you a while to realize it
I love how much the voice acting in this game is amazing
you need to learn to not let the orcs get to you
you can do a 2nd facecam for a bit
I think the game is just a lot of filler
I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts

do you want us to watch your feet?
Play the doom ost please, I'm begging you
they are just trying to scare you
what the hell is this game i love it so much
jerma is just a man of culture and a short man
Jerma is the best, but we're all just bots
remember when you said you were going to play red alert?
you can still change the game to the original
its like the middle of the night
The only reason I can watch this stream is to get coffee and watch a movie :)
you can use the map to find stuff
jermaVenus is it still going to be a community night?
SourPls STREAMER PUTS PISS IN THE WATER SourPls

You can just use a stone to make a trowel
it's a good game but you have to finish it

====================
i cant believe jerma has a fart fetish
DO IT, YOU'LL GET THE FUCKING GROUND

i only eat pineapple on my pizza :)
the fact that you're playing this game makes me so sad

hey guys does anyone have the clip of jerma saying the s word?
I'm not a sub I'm not a redditor
jerma you know you can do this right
I can't believe that Jerma has been alive for more than a year.
if you say you want to do this but we won't tell you, then you're a coward
you need to play more of the same game
i'm going to miss the carnival stream jermaPluto
i cant believe jerma has a degree in gardening
oh no jerma is playing the simpsons game
he's just a bunch of people trying to figure out how to get around
you can actually see the black spots on the ground
Why do you always have to deal with chat jermaPluto
do you like the idea of a beach
i dont know what the fuck is going on
the game wants you to be the bad guy
You can't just say "I'm gonna buy that" and expect people to buy it
that was the best thing to happen to this stream
I'm gonna make a video on this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqxOi8QyCxA
this is like when you call an old man a boomer
i cant believe jerma is finally playing his own game
I want to go to bed, but I'm not a sub.
it's so much better than the first game
you can buy a car in this game
i think this is why you're not a real gamer
YOU CAN'T CHECK THE LEFT SCREEN IF YOU'RE IN A HIGHWAY
How long do you have to play this
you know what happens when you don't have a good excuse
You need to be careful, there are babies in the game
I feel bad for the devs of this game
do you want me to call you daddy?
you have to find a way to put the black hole back
You can sell your blood for a lot of money
play a game with the text to speech
I just got here, what is this? PogChamp
you have to look at the ground to see the sun
I want to see you get fired from the newspaper
You're gonna die from too much alcohol jermaDisgust
that's what happens when you don't have a good excuse
i'm not sure if you know this but
you can't just stand there, it's dangerous
Make the voice actor play the original
is this the streamer that beat a game ON STREAM?
That's a good spot to get a key
THE SHIELD IS NOT ROUND THE ROCK
I am genuinely excited for this stream, I am going to miss the beginning of it
you can do anything you want to do
you can't just say "suck a fart out of my ass"
please just use the car to get back to the hotel
i just got back, did he just kill the cat?
you need to get the boots to unlock the secret level
you can do anything you want with a card
this is what happens when you dont have a good excuse
I hope the dev is in chat and says "Hi! I'm a new viewer!"
He is going to die to the first boss
You can have a lot of money to buy a house
You're

you can find the achievements for this game by looking at the game files
if you get the boots you can go to the other side of the map and save your progress

is this the end of the game?
Jerma can you please play an actual game?
If you do the voices again, I'll donate 10k bits
that was your favorite part of that scene
How do you not know what a jpeg is?
go to the top of the tower
What if you dont go to bed?
this game is the only thing that matters
I'm pretty sure this is a metaphor for your past self
i can't believe this streamer is cheating on us
I'm in the same boat as Jerma
If you dont play the games you don't
====================
go to the bottom of the screen and press the fire button
is this the guy that got stuck on the carnival platform?
Hey man, can you please pause for a second?
so if you want to play a game, why not just play Half Life?
Why does this streamer look like a version of himself
LUL he doesn't know he's being watched LUL
why are you using a voice changer? @Jerma985
this is the most fun thing I've ever seen in my life
i think you need to buy more guns
This is the only time I will be able to catch a stream, it's like a 1 hour stream
It's like that scene from the simpsons where Bart wins
Why are you playing this game, you are a fucking psycho
you can just eat it, it's not that hard
the guy in the top right is the one who gave you the key
go to the borscht room and talk to the old lady
I just got here, what's going on?
why are you so afraid of the malding guy
did you know that the time is based on the time it takes for you to get to the center of the sun?
why does he look like a 5 year old
He's gonna end up like the old guy who died to pinwheel
i wish i could listen to this music
They gave you a huge army and you have no money
you can't go in the desert with the desert army
It's like those old Pogs you had in your old bones
you're gonna have a stroke if you don't change your diaper
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
what the fuck did i just tune into
you can just hold it and then press the touchpad
i am going to get you a sub
you can still find the gun, you just need to go to the second floor
is this a new one or a 2nd one?
You can skip this if you just do it from the start menu
This is one of the hardest bosses in the game
The game has a cheat engine, you should try that
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys lets get this jup out of the way
do you know how to play this game?
you should start from the top of that tower
I don't know what you're talking about
just put the top of the tree down
Lmao you call yourself a Jerma fan? Iâ€™m fucking loaded on channel points bro. I highlight every message because Iâ€™m just that jacked. Try talking in chat again when youâ€™re a true fan.
theres a secret ending in this game @Jerma985
You've been streaming for the last hour
i want to go to sleep, but i can't sleep until you finish this
did you know that if you go to the sewers you'll get a million points
I like how you can hear the bodies from a mile away
Jerma, I'm sorry you have to deal with this pain. I hope you have a wonderful night.
you need to learn the new moves
Can you play the song of fear to the tune of this song please?
is this the part where he shits himself
This is just the sequel to last time
you need to use a different controller to play this
imagine if he was a bear on a board
I bet you all would be pretty pog
that guy in the top right looks like a fucking caveman
you have to do it with the same character
they would have done the whole thing for this game
youre gonna have to do that all over again LUL
go to the left to the right
hey jerma, what's your favorite food to eat?
It's not a game, it's a movie
remember when you said "this is the most stressful thing"
remember when you said that you were going to play this for 5 hours?
if you're in a car crash, do you need to take a quick mental note?
are you gonna get the extra one
go back to the top of the tower
HES GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO
====================
do you like me a big bowl of red hot?
is it true that you ate a shoe?
It's a lie, he said he had to stop
I'm just here for the stream and Jerma is making me watch his streams
you can get some more than 2 dollars for the sword and shield
I have to wait until the end of the year to vote on this one
i can't believe jerma is late and he's never gonna stream again jermaPluto
i think you can just save your money
you can buy the egg from the egg shop
I thought that was the guy who got the ring?
you should probably play Black & White 2
he's gonna say he likes it or he's gonna give up
did you know that bernie sanders is in the chat?
I'm getting really mad that you're not playing this
it's not like the vr game is bad
he's just going to say it and forget about it
you look like a lot of people who were born in the 70s
Just play the game, you'll be fine
JERMA DONT LISTEN TO THE NINJA TRIGGER
you're on a break, the server is down
I found this video of the movie "The Dark Knight Rises"
You don't have to go back to the previous room

theres a secret door to the second floor
you can get them from the store @Jerma985
I dont know what the fuck is going on
you're the only streamer who can actually kill the boss
This guy just played a game and he's playing it wrong
Hey chat, just got back, what's the point of this
jerma is the only person to play this game
can you please say "it" when you type it?
hey guys im just gonna say hi to the mods :)
This is what happens when you dont get a real gamer license
jermaHeart jermaHeart i hope you have a good time
I bet the stream is delayed until the end of the year
i dont think it was a good idea to make that noise
you can build houses with the greenstone

i don't know what the fuck you're talking about
You can use the "Go to the tavern" button
you need to drink more to fully heal

you should check out the new From Software game, it's called "Call of Duty"
You got a good chance to learn the new skills
You can't just say "I'm gonna play this game"
I think he's just gonna sit there for 5 hours
i hate that you dont know how to play the game
I'm pretty sure Jerma never played Heroes of Might and Magic

====================

I can't believe they made a baseball game
you have to beat the first level to unlock the other levels
you know what kind of food to eat
I was watching a few hours ago and your hair looks good
have you ever thought about playing a pokemon game on stream?
I'm in a fucking fever dream and I'm so happy you're back
Jerma, please do a stream where you eat a whole sleeve of oreos and then chew on the shell. I would be so fucking happy
he's not paying attention to the story LUL
you should get a new mic to use the wii speaker
you're just a fucked up version of yourself
your doing a great job! a GREAT JOB
I DONT KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT IT IS A GOOD SONG
You're not even going to the gym anymore. You're just going to the gym.
you have to get the boots first LUL
I'm gonna be honest, I think this is the most boring game ever
are you gonna play the full game?
I think the rat is trying to break in
so what's the point of that?
HOLD AND THEN RELEASE THE HAND LIKE A MANUAL
you missed a spot on the right side of the hill
You can just jump on top of him
The game's graphics are awesome, and the game is so good, but it's not good for stream
There's a music cue on the bottom right of the screen
You're a good man. I'm proud of you.
why does this look like it's from a porn ad
I'm so glad to see that there's a bigger audience for this game.
you can charge a spell for 10k HP
you can't just say something on the spot
I'm going to come back and ask if he's playing this again
you can't just pick it up in the middle of the room
what the fuck is wrong with this guy
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THIS AGAIN
Make the other characters into statues to raise money for your statue army
we're watching you play a game that's actually difficult
I thought you were gonna be on the front page of reddit
why do you think they make that noise?
You're going to die in the game anyway
you are going to die in real life
make sure to do the same thing again
just got here. whats going on in this game
jerma just put the bottom of your hand in front of you to make sure you're not clipping
the devs arent even playing the game
this is a fun game and i love it
LUL I feel so bad for that guy
You're making it so you can talk in chat like a drunk
jerma just play the movie please :)
would you rather have a large pile of tomatoes or a small pile of tomatoes?
stop trying to hit them with a rock
you can just jump and dodge. just keep pressing the button

jerma is just playing the game in real time
if you don't use the ring you can't use the ring
"I'm not gonna give you a cent" - Jerma985
The save is saved in the save menu
why is your character so small, its you
You have a very large pan
I'm watching this game from the TV and it's fucking hilarious
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BEAT IT, STOP IT
You can use your divine confetti to make the target even stronger
can't believe this game has a sports announcer
put the item in the ring and try to find the ring before you fight him
I'm back from dinner, what did I miss?
I just want to see you in the bathroom again
I think it's because you didn't finish the game
i'm gonna order some more diapers from the internet
i'm gonna buy this game for my nephew
jerma im gonna go get a drink, come back later
YOU ARE JUST A FAST FOOD FATHER @Jerma985

it was fun to sit in the middle of a desert and watch a lot of this
this guy is a fucking L O L
you have to have a level 50 magic item
it's a lie it's not a game, it's a prop
You got a lot of money on this mission
you should have just used the shovel
I can't believe you've been playing this game for 5 hours straight

It's a lie, you didn't get the boots
Hey Jerma! Would you like to play my level?
Please don't do any of the crazy stuff. I know you can't be that bad, but that's just a little too much.
I miss the old Jerma that didn't use the soundboard
you're a god gamer, you can beat this level
I can't believe he's playing this game for the first time
they're gonna get sued for not selling the right to make a cartoon
LUL this is the worst stream ever. I can't believe I'm watching it
please play the new rat movie, the movie that makes all the rules
you can make the scout into a sniper by just using it
have you ever considered playing this game with a controller?
i think the whole point of this game is to have a little fun in it
do you have any idea how much money you have?
is this the new Animal Crossing music?
i think it's because you forgot to take the balloon
there is a secret in the room
Jerma is a boomer and you know it
that was the most generic thing you could say
you can walk in and find a new place
it's like when he gets mad at the dark souls boss
There's a secret in the room with the chest
It's a lie, you didn't get the boots
This is like a third party mod for Minecraft, you're in a weird spot
You should've just done the actual game, you'd be here for the rest of the stream
Are you going to be in the new Vegas?
you can just do it for free jerma
You need to look at your closet @Jer
====================
What was your favorite time to pee?

The only way to make it go up is to have it be a big deal
Jerma is gonna get banned for not showing feet on stream jermaPluto
i can't believe you just said that
is it true you are dead? jermaPluto
This is what happens when you dont pay attention
This game is so good, it's so much better than this one
you have to pay for the icecream jerma
hey guys im gonna go get my cereal
you can't play it if you don't have the game on
just play the game normally so you can pretend you're playing it
you need to find the secret room
If you press R you can use your special move
You're gonna get mad at this game
What's the point of this if it's going to be a long one
you dont need to do anything
Jerma, this is your mother. I've been watching your stream for the past 5 years and have been disappointed in how little you are. Please, wake up.
I think he's about to be a meme
this game is just a remake of a really good game
you can just make a rat out of a human
the fucking krusty krab is a real thing
Just stand in front of the camera
THE CIRCLE IS FOR THE LEGS NOT THE HEAD
you are going to get really mad at this game
You're not gonna be able to do it
jermaPluto I remember when we all died jermaPluto
I remember when you used to be a streamer jermaPluto
There's a spot where you can grind up and level up if you want
just play the game and you wont have to reload
I've been watching you since your TF2 videos
I'm still waiting for you to stream a Nancy Drew game
this is just a normal game with a new game mechanic
LMAO you have a lot of space in your house
I'm so glad you got the boots for that
The other day you said "I would be playing Halo"
do you have any tips for getting your gamer license renewed?
jerma your voice is very low, you can hear me
did you know that we have the same smell
I don't even know what a game is
I'm not gonna tell anyone but the copypasta was great
it's in the middle of the desert
i think you have to go to the top of the mountain
The one thing you did wrong is drink too much coffee
I mean it's true that it's kinda lame to not be able to say it in the intro but it's still funny
I am going to go watch your vod
I feel like a lot of people in chat are just happy to see me and not realize it
You need to get rid of the spear

There's a LOT of time for a couple of things
Make a new character and replace the one you already have
you dont have to go back and play it
i bet he can't beat the first level
i know how to make it simple
you can make the normal clothes and then the new ones
You're going to have to be in the game to read this.
I wonder what jerma thinks of this game
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS THINGS DONE AROUND HERE
I dont remember this one being this hard
i hope jerma reads this and plays the game
I feel like I've never played this game before
You're the only person in the room
you can't do it, you have to beat the final boss
jerma i need a doctor to check my pee
why does this game look like its made by the same devs
go to the top of the house
that was the first time you have ever said "I'm not gonna play this"
jerma if you die in game you die in real life
there's a game called "The Thing" it's really good
you can find an item that can get you an item
is this a prequel to the jerma vs star movie?
the sound effects in this game are so fucking good
you just sold your soul to a wild animal
The chat is going so fast nobody will know that I'm gay :)
do you have the halo 1 update yet
i have to go to work in 2 hours
Why is this guy so obsessed with the Dark Souls series
I like how the "i'm not gonna lie" joke is just a game he would do anything
Jerma it's time to go to bed, we're getting to bed
have you tried turning it off and on again?
I can't believe Jerma is finally playing a game he hates
please just go to the bathroom and take a break
How long do you think it will take to get into the fucking bathroom
you're going to have to do this again
What if I want to sleep too?
you have to find the guy who died
imagine if you actually had a job and you just came to work for a week
please do the one where they eat a shoe
You're not in the mood for the food
This is a game for children, it's okay
Is this the new Lord of the rings?
you're not gonna do it to the guy
If you kill the carpenter, you can get a new one
Please add a no-nepalm ending to this game
HES NOT REAL, HE HAD A DREAM monkaS
imagine being a normal person in 2019 LUL
you have to beat the final boss
Jerma I think the video is cutting out
the only people that need to know the lore are the normies
why are you so nice to these guys?
The game is just a sequel to this game, it's like a different game
why are we playing this again? i was gone for like 15 minutes
You can press R to skip the level
you can't do anything with your stick in the air
I'm so excited for this stream, I'm gonna go to bed.
you should try out the new star wars game
I want to see you play with that game
this is the best thing to happen this year
it's the right side of the room
i'm sorry jerma, but your mic is low
I can't believe you're still playing this game
you have to get the car now
this is just a direct sequel to this game, the first one
====================

JERMA YOU'RE GONNA GET A SHOT IN THE HEAD
If you play DMC2 again I will give you 10 million dollars

how are you so bad at this game
im not a baby jerma but im an adult
I'm glad we have a cawfee in this chat
youre the one who died to pinwheel
i think you just hate people who are bad at video games
Just got here, is he doing the game right?
you can turn the graphics down in the options
you can get a gun for the price of one gun
the game is just a shitty version of the original
I just got here and I already hate it
You can actually play it if you want to
do you know how to play an arcade game?
This is a trainwreck, please stop playing it
jerma you dont have to do it on stream, you can do it on your own
didnt know this game had a terrible ending
If you read this message, I'm going to die.
he's not streaming today, he's been drinking and watching your stream, you're all fucked up
please take your time and try to enjoy the game
why is the main character in the dark
we are your parents, we watch your stream :)
the best way to learn is to do a tutorial on it
I think you can just play the game
it's a bit hard to read, it's like 3 different systems
i would buy a hotdog with the hamster in it
you dont need to go to the menu
why do you have a face cam in the bottom right corner
The game makes you hate the boss and you can't even beat it
i dont know what to do with my life now
you can get a gun for the price of one gun
you are too much of a boomer to play this
You can just use the gamecube one as a background
I've had it with the printer for like 2 years
you have to beat the last level
you have to get to the top of the tower
i have a feeling you'll find a way to get to the top
i love that you dont realize that there are people in this chat who use this channel to post and comment on stuff
i like how he's just like "what the fuck"
can you stream the game at the same time as i do
jerma has been dead for a year, we have to let him go
You can probably make it by yourself if you want to
JERMA, YOU NEED TO GET SOME HYPE IN THE CHAT
i'm sorry to hear that jermaPluto I'm also sorry for your loss
you are the only person i've seen that has done a jerma joke
When theres a streamer, it's just you and chat
did you watch the new Half Life?
I was a teacher at a public library when I was younger
do you think you'll play the next game?
just add more to the list of things you can do
this is the most generic game ever made
they didn't have a "raid" to get there
You have to play the game for the tutorial
I'm so happy Jerma is playing this game
I'm pretty sure you're doing the same thing as the last two streams
can you tell us how much of a dickhead you are?
i'm going to fucking cry if you don't stop playing this
I am just going to say it, Jerma is the best streamer on Twitch
jermaOld why are you so mean to us
can you play the new Animal Crossing music?
You can change it to a random color
I just realized there are people in this chat to use emotes on
If you don't get it you have to play a new game
I can't believe Jerma has been playing this game for 5 hours
This is why you need
====================
I would say, the game is a little boring
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Monday. Around 3-4pm PDT!

do you think there is a code for that?
"I can't believe he's still playing this game"
What if the mirror is real and you are Jerma?
why does jerma look like he's wearing a wig
hey can you stream from the bathroom
jerma you just made it to the end of the game
YOU LITERALLY SAID YOU WOULD DO IT IN ONE TRY
it's like a reverse circle in a circle
you should get a bunch of em
can you wait like 15 min for me to finish my shit
jerma can you please explain what the fuck is happening
jerma is a funny guy, funniest guy on twitch
I feel like I'm watching a real jerma stream
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
you can do it if you play good
i got my fill of red tonight jermaVenus
he's too afraid of his own shadow to be scared
i dont know how this game works but i think theres a secret door

jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
how many people have you killed in the last hour?
you can do it if you play good
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Wednesday! Around 3-4pm PDT!

I think the only thing he can learn is how to play the game
oh god oh fuck jerma is going to be so mad
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8

You know what they say about big hands
You can do it if you play good :)
you look like a child who has been in a basement
you can do it if you play good
chat is so nice, i love you :)
JERMA YOU NEED TO GET THE WINDOW, IT'S YOUR THIRST
what a terrible way to die, holy shit
the only way to get out is to be open
you need to upgrade your library or you'll never play WoW again
make sure you can get the boots, they are useful for this playthrough

this is a very bad movie, but a good one
"You know what would be a really good stream?"
he is going to run out of time
You have to eat your own shit @Jerma985
remember to get a new body before you go
it would be great if you gave them new outfits
you're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOOB
You need to go back to the first game
you have to do all the other quests
you should have done the lord of the rings trilogy instead
If you're watching this on your phone, you're a little late
You can get the skeleton later if you go into the new room
jerma why did you have to tell me you can't stream anymore

I'm here for the short stream and you're here for the long one
is this the same voice actor as the guy who beat dark souls on stream?

I would have thought a tarantula would be in a petri dish
I think they mean "Soapbox" or "Mummy" so I don't know
I think he said he's gonna play it
this is a childrens game for a 13 year old
you can check the logs on the left side of the screen to see if there are still people
Jerma, if you're reading this, please stop. I know streaming can be stressful but doing this for the fans makes it so much more enjoyable. I'm glad you're having so much fun.
you can just pause and try again
your going to kill him in the next 10 minutes
JERMA WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH REVERB
I'm glad you're playing this, I've been trying to catch up on the VODs and it's been really fun
Iâ€™m going to be the one to ask that
PLEASE SEND IT TO A FRIEND WHO DOESNT KNOW
remember to enable slow mode after every video
you should play this game with ster, he's playing it

I hope Jerma is in the next jerma rumble

I hope Jerma doesn't play this game today
jerma you are doing a GREAT JOB
I am not a sub, but I'll sub for you
you can turn it off with the help of the menu
How long have you been playing this game?
You can't just go to the store and buy another one, you have to go back and buy the same one
how do you know if your the same person?
I can't believe you didn't save the game
what is your opinion on the fact that Jerma is playing as the bad guy
this is just the master of comedy level of fun
i think you have to hit the game to see the code
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 that's the way i like to jup
if you get 100 bucks you can join the cult
I'm not a sub, but I'll sub for you
It's gonna be the same stream as last time
You could have just got the boots
you can turn it off with the help of the menu
Hey, you're a true fan! I just got a new desktop background.
you need to get the boots first
you look like a wild west man
jerma is gonna eat his way into the top shelf
you can just leave it running on steam and come back
you need to remember that theres no "wrong" way to die
I have a question for you Jerma
Jerma you can do a full playthrough of this game without playing it
"You can't just sit here and do nothing"
I can't believe this is the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream PogChamp

====================
You can speed up time and it'll get faster
Is this the streamer that beat the first level of the sims?
you're the only one playing this game
i would love if you played this with the music on
You look like a 30 year old boomer
You are in a coma, the doctors have found your voice is a bit off.
It was a dream, he was just dreaming
Why does the music sound like it's been sitting on a TV for like a month?
I love that you can't even see the damn thing
you have to get it on the actual game
You're playing this game with a broken keyboard
this is the most... entertaining game i've ever watched
why is the title of the stream "DOG SHITS IN THE BATHROOM"
jerma do you still have your reddit room
this is the same stream as the last one
I'm gonna go watch the vod, thanks :)
The music in this game is so good
this is like the dog food from rats
DONT GO IN THE SINK NOTHING EVER AGAIN
I'm not sure how you are able to see the map
you can just walk to the side of it
You can get the next level on the way back
YOU COULD BE PLAYING THIS WITHOUT THE GAME
I remember when Jerma was a boy jermaPluto
I'll give you $10 if you say the line
if you just beat the first level you can get a secret in this
put the skeleton in your inventory and use it to do your quests
How long did he spend on the pig head boss?
JERMA YOU WERE ON THE WRONG GRANDMOTHER'S STREAM
I'm glad the game doesn't just tell you how to find stuff.
this is like the first time you've ever played this game
You can only do it once, and you will die
YOU CAN'T DO IT, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE GAME
can you play the 700,000 games video?
Do you think you'll ever play Halo?
You can do it if you get to the end
I love that he is in this movie
jerma is so cute, I bet he has a date with the model
I'm trying to watch the show but I can't watch the movie
How is it possible to be this bad?
Jerma, you should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
I'm so glad I came into this stream
you can get a new weapon by climbing the last piece of the rubble
please play more of the Sekiro games
You could've gotten more money by selling the game already
is that why you look so weird
you're making me feel like I'm in the dentist office
theres a secret boss in this game
it's a vampire you have to kill it
you have to sit on the top row
you know youre not allowed to say anything youre not allowed to say
if you didnt know it was a thing then why do you do it now
I'm gonna do the thing where I go to the store and buy some ram and then come back and buy a ram
You should be the one to get your own own death
you could have gone for the sword
I got a gift sub from a guy who got stuck in the same spot, thanks jerma
I'm so glad I got to meet Jerma and his mods
do you have the clip of you killing the guy in the mall
stop with the bad jokes it's not funny anymore
it wasnt the dog, it was the dog
you're gonna get so mad you need to use the bathroom
i think you can just change the game
can you do the "you're a child" bit again?
i can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
this is the best game in the world
this is the first time i've ever seen a jerma stream
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
Hey guys, Jerma here, sorry I didn't hear about you being a furry.
I think the only thing you can do is to kill the npc and
====================
DoesNT work on theres like 6 or 7 people here
I just want to watch the vod with you
I think the camera is too close to the mic
You don't get to watch this game for another hour
he was talking about the stream not us :(
i was in the shower when the last stream started and i just noticed your face
I can't believe he's not playing Kenshi again
he was just fucking around with it and then he forgot about it
I'm not sure if you're joking or not
The man has no face, but his voice is like a demonic satanic satanic satanic satanic satanic monkaS
I'm going to eat my own ass
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
I don't think he'll be able to get past the first level
this game is just a glorified flash game
jermaPluto I didn't even know there was a stream
I dont even know what game this is
your hair looks so nice today :)
He's gonna be doing the voice at the end of the stream
i can't believe this guy is streaming right now
you can do it if you don't play the game
you need to take a break after that
it was a little too much for my head
what if the whole thing is just a joke
You need to get a mod that makes it so that you have to eat a ghost pepper on stream
If you dont play the game in the next 10 minutes I will literally lose my shit
didnt he say he was going to play something today
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2
you have to wear the same costume every time
you have to look at the ground to dodge
you have to put it in your mouth
Did you know that if you turn the game off it turns on and you have a FULL bodycam on?
I love the way he says he's going to do this in 30 minutes
I miss when Jerma was an actor jermaPluto
Do you know what a number generator is
have you ever considered playing anything other than the original Dead Rising 2?
That's a lot of money, you know that?
you said you'd do more on this one
I want to be the one to say "SHOW ME SHOW ME"
Dont worry guys, he just finished the VOD jermaHeart
i have never seen someone so invested in a game before
can you do the old, old joke again?
The game has some really cool effects, but they don't really translate well to the screen.
I thought this was gonna be a chill stream
Just had a bad day at work. LUL
Just dont do anything stupid, you'll be fine
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
this is like a 20 year old game
we should have a contest to vote for the worst joke of the year
You got a new character, remember? @Jerma985
if you put the boots on, they'll fall off
YOU NEED TO BE AT LEAST 22 IN THE SERVER TO BE A REAL GAMER
jermaPluto your hair looks like a balloon
SourPls THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING GOOD SOURPLS
That's how you say your dog is big
i'm scared of being banned for saying something so controversial
you're on the right side of the ocean
would you say that you are an asshole
I've never been more nervous in my life
I want to say that you're the most handsome streamer ever
i can't believe jerma lied about star wars
can you get me some lemonade please
i just joined and i'm already crying
If you can't handle me at my worst, obey your thirst
I'm going to be a very important piece of the pie
are you playing this for the entire stream
he's gonna spend all the bits on the rats
I'm so fucking scared for my life right now
You can do it, but you have to play it again
What about the time you ate a shoe?
I think you can just add "Halo Reach" to the end of a channel point
he is going to die in the end
you can do it jerma, you
====================
ers are more than just RATS
imagine having to pay for a sub for someone to have a good time LUL
It's not a jerma stream, it's a Jerma twitch chat
i heard there's a mod that makes it so you can have a chat with no matter what chat is going to be
that's a good idea, you should have a handcam on
hey man, you're having a good day :)
If you say hi to them, they'll come see you
you need to do the 100 jumps first
if you're not paying attention, this is the game
JERMA IS GOING TO BE LATE IN 2 MINUTES
I hope Jerma plays the new Animal Crossing
Jerma I'm trying to watch the movie but I can't stop thinking about you
This is the same guy that played on the PS2
i wish i had a single person to talk to
I bet he can't even beat the first boss of this game
You need to turn the lights off for the secret ending
i thought you were going to do a new years stream
jermaOld the car was gonna go through the wall
its been 2 years and he's still in the tutorial
I've never played a game like this before
Why do you have a diaper on?
you have to use a water pump
i think theres a big spider in your mouth
I remember when Jerma used to stream jermaPluto
i am glad you're back jermaPluto
i wish i had a single person to talk to
go to the zoo, there is a huge exhibit there
jerma if you dont play the game im unsubbing
you should play the OST to get a little more rhythm
If you are just enjoying the game, why are you playing it?
I think you can go to the beach and swim in it
i love how jerma is so cool with these things
I'm having fun but im scared of the worst part of it
I love that this game has a pretty nice soundtrack
I'll be honest, I don't really know what's going on
i dont think jerma can get past this level
I can't believe Jerma is dead. He's gonna get his ass kicked and all of chat will be sad
Why does Jerma think he's a real person?
I'm gonna need a high iq to get through this level
If you beat the final boss, you can unlock the true ending!
I'm gonna miss the carnival stream if it's not today
i miss the old jerma that would play games
you can actually do this with the free trial
Hey, is that the guy that ate the shoe?
this game is really easy if you just play it at the prompt
if you can't find it then you're gonna have to try it again
he's trying to sell you a fake gamer card
i think its because youre not a true gamer
theres a secret ending you missed in the other room
jermaOld get me some of that RAGE jermaOld
if you're having a good time, you're not playing it
i only have 2 messages left on the chat, but im watching a vod of this
I can't believe he got a 4th location
you can do a level in this game
is he still doing the 5th game? LUL
i just got here, what is going on
you need to play the music to this
i would like to see some more jermaOld
you're not a true gamer unless you use the Zinc badge
its not a fake one its a real one
imagine how many jerma subs you would get
You don't know how to use the arrow keys
I would be so happy if you played this game for the rest of the stream.
you can only do it once, you'll get timed out for that one
can we get a new emote for the new emote?
i cant believe jerma said it was a joke
Jerma, can you say "Hey" for me?
theres a secret ending you missed in the other room
i cant believe you got a new emote
I think you need to get the boots
I'm gonna leave for like 15 minutes and then I'm gonna say it's too late
I think
====================
youre gonna get banned for playing this game
this is like the new Home Alone episode
i want to get off Mr. Mosquito's wild ride
this is the first time i've ever seen you play this
do you think you'll ever stream Dead Space?
I hope they add a 2ndjerma video
I can't believe Jerma is playing a game that everyone is already bored with
theres a new emote for this fight? https://imgur.com/a/Tk5mjz
LUL oh my god theres that one LUL
you can go to the other side of the map and do it
jerma has been live for channel is not live
i wish i could give you money to donate to charity
jerma is not late, he is early jermaVenus
I would like to order a Pizza right now
I think you're the only streamer with the chance
I'm very disappointed in you, not gonna lie
I thought that was a rock but it was a frog
I'd be so happy to have you here
you can speed up time by clicking on the random button
have you heard of the new Sam and Max game?
why is he dressed like the guy who murdered Santa Claus
you should play The Thing or Red Alert 2
do you know what a license is
you have to get all the items to get the secret
you're too good to be a foodie
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY WITH YOU
I have to go to bed soon please start the stream
you're playing as a girl in this game
i would eat my own hair on stream
JERMA DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO A CHEAT?
jerma I'm going to eat my own hair on stream
jerma is the only streamer that watches this game
i'm from boston i know it sounds weird but you're the only streamer i know who's played this
The only good thing about this game is that it's so easy to get a combo and then kill people
Jerma if you beat this boss I will donate 5 dollars :)
he was talking about his upcoming carnival stream
you need to be more aggressive in the fight
Theres a giant portal in the middle of the room
I think you need to get a new mouse
this is going to be a good stream
you know theres a button to the right of the top left
I have to go to bed now, can you finish the last game of fellowship?
Jerma, if you ever get to the part where you die, you have to stop streaming forever
no one is paying attention to the game, you are just playing it
jerma i can't believe you're still playing this game
Jerma you can do anything you want with the gun
do you know how to play the game?
you gotta get your ass beat first
Please tell me that's not a griller joke
do you have a dog? Are they very small?
you can get a mower in the shop
You can use the wiimote to fix your bike
i was gone for an hour, what happened to the +2 -2
Jerma please, stop eating so much of the food
hey I just got here what the fuck happened?
He's getting his hand ripped off. Looks like a sandwich.
you can just go on the discord and talk shit to them
How does it feel to be old enough to be Jim Carrey's dad?
why are you playing a game with a Japanese voice actor?
you can unlock the secret boss in this game
you can get it with the dlc, you have to do a quest
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT
you have to kill the orcs first then kill the thief
Jerma have you ever played the sequel to this game?
Would you ever play the hit and run OST?
im gonna take a nap while you're gone
That's a pretty good game, this is a great game
I saw a picture of your mom's feet in the grocery store!
I'm playing this game and it's a fucking disaster
I'm not paying you to read this :)

====================
i
I was here when Jerma died, that's why he's streaming this
I wish he'd play Death Stranding again
You can check if you're the one that's dying by playing this game
I dont think you can say it so it doesnt matter
this is why you're the best streamer
I just got here and I'm already losing my mind
you know this is a time travel thing?
i just came back and you are still doing this
you're gonna need to do a lot of taxes to get a job
This game looks pretty good. The graphics are nice
I just realized that I've never seen this game before
how much money do you have in the bank
jerma, this is the most you can do to a serial killer
jerma is the type of guy who only goes to the store for food
You need a place to store your stuff
would you say that the stream is boring to watch?
you're supposed to hold shift while doing a move
I know what it is but not what it is
jermaPluto I can't wait to see jerma lose to pinwheel
can you finish the game please :)
You're just sitting in your room, waiting for the stream to start
how long has jerma been stuck on this boss
if you dont finish this game i will be VERY VERY VERY VERY very VERY VERY VERY VERY very VERY VERY VERY
You need to play the whole game on stream
if you want to play you need to play halo
your character looks like a Jerma character
stop being a psycho youre making me wanna play tf2
I've been in this room for like 20 minutes
is this the guy who died to pinwheel on stream?
make a new one, it's a good one
You know you can make fun of us when you play these games
you can jump over the rock you can jump over the rock
You're gonna get a lot of those
How much did they pay you to play this game
I'm not even sure what's going on
you can do a big jump over the wall, it's only 1 block
i dont think theres a real pizza hut in my area
imagine if jerma wasnt a character in this game
Why did you make a bingo card for this game?
I really like the bit where he says "fuck it"
you can make a hotel in the city with the cash of course
I'd love to see him play this game
The guy from the mario tennis game with the skateboard
it's not a real dentist, its a dentist who knows his patients
go to the bar and ask if it's open
When are you gonna play the sequel to this game?
I can't believe you put a hulk in the fight
you guys are getting +2ed to this one
I can't wait for the end of the stream
the game is for a 14 year old
Hey jerma I'm gonna go get a drink, can you pause the game?
you should go to the store and buy a new car
imagine having to get up at 5am to go to the supermarket and they had a bunch of weird stuff
please make sure you dont play with the girl in the mirror, she is very awkward and you wont let her go to bed
You have to wait till you're close to the entrance of the building
You have to do the tutorials first
jerma is not even gonna play this game
you should be playing TF2 right now
didnt this guy play the game in its entirety
you have to get on top of the building
please play this game because it is the best one
oh my god you're gonna be so mad at the vod
you can have a lot of sugar too
I'm so glad you got the boots jermaHeart
is this a battle royale stream or a real life one
This is how you make money in GTA
you can also make it so you can play as a different character
you could say that with the voice changer
he has to pay for your gamer license
It's like they don't want to be friends
I am going to be honest I really hope you don't play this game
====================
 IT WAS NOT THE FUCKING GAME
you should go into the menu and choose the options
I don't know why you're so bad at this game
you can go to a restaurant and order a burger and have it be at the same time
i hope theres a streamer that isnt just a robot
oh god i cant wait to see the rest of the game
I'm getting a bunch of Dr. Pepper recommendations, should I?
i was gone for a couple hours and he's still playing this
i thought you were gonna say "I'm not a furry"
You're the only one playing this game :)
chat is moving so fast nobody will see that i love you all
I hope jerma plays a game for the first time. :)
That's a really good idea, as long as you're having fun :)
i am one of those people who cant even beat a game
i hope this is the last stream of the stream
i'll be back in like 2 hours when he's done with this game
jerma you need to get the boots they are so good
how can you be so bad at this game
can you repeat the question and answer question please
when you kill the final boss, you can grab the meatball and eat it
this is the best part of the stream
it's been a while since you did the backpack voice
I think you can take the headset off while you're streaming
Do you have any plans on playing The Thing?
go to the menu and choose the options
he only has 1 day left before the stream starts
you can probably buy a house in this game
if you do a spill joke you get to play the game
i hate the way jerma is using the "dont"
oh god its gonna be a dumb stream LUL
theres a new vod of the episode of daphne and shes a lady with a cat
if you dont eat a shoe you are a furry
is this the guy that died to pinwheel?
this is the best thing ever and im crying
you can't really have a combo if you're not a good match
I just got here, what is this game?
I can't believe you'll be playing this for 3 hours
i am so fucking addicted to this game
I just came back. I dont understand this game
you know this is a jerma stream right?
this game is going to be a disaster
jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
i dont think i can handle this game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 im a mod, just the best of friends jermaJup3 jermaJup4
did you know that you can use the arrow keys to move?
just wait for the clown to jump off the top of the building
I'm glad you are finally playing a game with your full attention span
You're a good guy, but you don't deserve to be there
i'm gonna miss the last stream so i guess i have to watch the vod
how many times have you guys said that
would you rather have a big rat or a little rat?
you can move the body part to the right
if you don't do the voice, I'll be mad jermaSun
oh fuck that was a funny joke holy shit
jerma has been live for 3 hours and 45 minutes
I got a feeling this is gonna be a very good stream
oh god the jerma face is in the corner
I'm back from the bar and this is worse than the last game LUL
have you seen the new "old games" ad?
i was gone for a couple hours and he's still playing this
I remember when this was a cat cafe stream
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
get the video of that cat from your TV
jermaWalk WE'LL DO IT FOR THE LIVING jermaWalk
I just joined and I see that image
i miss the old jerma that would just show his ass
I think you can skip it by doing the move tree from the beginning of the game
theres a ton of rooms, go through them
stop streaming and just listen to the game
that's why he went to the store to buy a new controller
I hope you guys have all the time in the world

You are going to get a heart attack
jerma the game isnt meant to be played in a vacuum
I hope I don't get banned from Twitch for posting that
i want to watch the whole thing
you know you're not supposed to say anything
i think they're using the same place they were in last year
you can still hear the music in the game
Can you wait like 5 minutes to get back to the tutorial?
i have a large volume slider on my phone so i can hear the audio
It's going to take you a few hours to complete the tutorial
I'm going to have to go to bed
we need to bring jerma back to life
i wish jerma was a big chad like minecraft
i hope the first part of the game was a good one
You're the only one with a good voice
Can you put the teleporters in the right spots
this is the last of my bits
You know, you could've just started your stream, you would've been doing this whole time.
You have to play the DLC now
imagine what it would be like to have a job
do you have a phone number or phone number
I got a gift sub a few days ago
This game is making me want to play Mario Yahtzee
do you have a favorite kind of icecream?
can you be quiet i want to go to bed
jermaOld im in my 30s and can't even play videogames
I know you are a streamer, but I can't tell you what to do anymore
Why is everyone in this town so nice to everyone
i dont know what im looking at LUL
You need to turn your facecam on
I'm an adult, please don't let me drink your pee
you have to get the red one
YOU NEED TO DO A SECOND JOB TO GET THE RED ONE
theres a set of stairs on the bottom left
you should probably try out Path of Exile
they could have a different theme for you
theres a secret boss in this game
do you have any advice on getting through this whole game?
we all know you're a millennial, just not us
we're going to be here all night
Is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?
I'm not gonna lie this is really hard to watch
You have to do it in front of the camera.
They're all going to be in a ditch, they'll have to find a new home.
You were supposed to do a stream where you would just sit in silence and just let chat play the game.
You need to look at the screen
jerma please just play some of the games that were on the list
you should make a channel for it
it's a good thing you're not doing it right
You have to get to the end of the game
you can play as the green giant and the red giant
this is a great game and i loved it :)
this guy's name is john cena, he's a drug dealer
he doesnt know the law of gravitation, he's just a regular human
this is just like that one scary game
you just got to the end of the game
i thought this was a random game LUL
You're gonna have to stream this again
you should've just done the tutorial and gotten the boots
you'll get the boots when you do it right
you can have a handfull of meatballs with this
did you see that new monster rancher game?
you
====================
I mean, he doesn't know what a tomato is
you can get a $20 headband for 100k
I'm sure you can do a better job
he just said he was gonna play it for a while
Jerma is a liar, he never knew jermaPluto
I got a gift sub once, but I'm broke
SourPls I'm so fucking hungry, please eat my ass
make your own music jerma, it's already been done
LUL I'm still waiting for him to play Half Life 3 on stream
"I'm gonna kill the guy" - Jerma 2020
my brother is getting a new computer
YOU NEED TO BE IN THE BRIM OFFLINE
i have to do all the work in this room
this is just the rest of the stream
i feel like im in a fever dream
that was the best joke of the year
remember when you said that you were gonna play seaman in the next jerma rumble?
you should play the Contra Hard Corps OST
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
is that what you're gonna do with your life?
my favorite part of this game is when you fight an enemy and then just run away
There is a little bit of a delay but it's not as bad as that
i think i had a dream where jerma was watching the video of his favorite game
You've been streaming for almost an hour and we've been stuck on this one puzzle
You need to get the boots to beat it
are you gonna play the new animal crossing
I remember when Jerma said he would stream on the 1st
I'm so happy he's not streaming today jermaPluto
he's doing the old voice of mambo no 5
i wonder how many people are watching this stream
Can you tell us a funny joke please?
jerma has been live for 10 minutes, he's already forgotten about the game
the game is a bit slow, I cant hear you
you can beat it on easy, just hard
I didn't even know there was a jerma emote
is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
guys lets all send him a very important message :)
You know this is the guy that died to pinwheel?
jermaSour when you have no idea how to make your own pizza
You can make your own music for this stream.
you can do it with a program called bttv
The first person to do a stream is Jerma
Can you add a "streamer only" option? @Jerma985
you're the only one that has to play this game
You can go into the dungeon and kill the wargs
Jerma you need to keep killing them to get the true ending
I love how much I love this game
I'm going to go watch the VOD of this game
I can't believe jerma is still live, he's got a new mic, and he's still talking about pee
I feel like I'm in the dark ages
make sure to build your army up so that your army doesn't die of old age
You know what would be really funny? You could just make some pancakes
You can beat it on easy, just hard
THE SHADOW IS YOUR FRIEND IRL
you look like a old lady
i would pay you to have a colonoscopy
please get rid of the bit badge
do you have a plan for when you play the new animal crossing?
I'm still here, I just wanted to say that I'm so happy you're playing this game :)
you can do it with bttv emotes
Jerma this is just a jpeg, you need to turn it on
I think the more you say the less funny it gets
I think it's time to get a bit of a headstart
This is a thing you can do on the map.
I thought the name was a joke. :(
"this is like a fight between two gays"
theres a shit ton of other places you can find to get there
this game is like a drug test
you need to buy it for the real one
This is why you have to put the entire thing into the toilet
You're gonna be stuck on this mission for the next 3 hours
you can kill
====================
Can you make your stream quieter by playing this?
jerma is just trying to get the boots
you have to put the chocolate in the binder
you have to get the other 2 before they get there
I'm so glad I got here at this point
you're gonna make me tear up with laughter
the guy in the bottom right is the cow
I love that the menu music is just the sound of jerma dying
I'm gonna tell the judge that you didn't do a good job
This is what happens when you dont read chat
but if you want to be a real gamer you have to play the game
this is the best game youve ever streamed
HERE COMES THE BLACK AND WHITE 2 (PART 2)
Just play the game, you don't need to
why does this guy look like a cartoon character
i mean it was the gamecube one
you can do the normal route and the long one
This is the best game of all time
You can use the last one as a barcode
you can sell stuff from the main menu
you look like a manlet who got out of a car
jerma please just play the game please :)
just keep running past the orcs and you'll be fine
theres a video on youtube of the game
if you give up you can play the game again
he's not gonna play it, he's not gonna be able to finish it
You can get the boots by the way
you're just giving him a bad name LUL
I'd rather have a bullet in my knee
you have to find the other ape
It's like someone is making a fake video of you
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen
this is a thing you can do with your hands
this is a good way to get the boots
it's a trick to get the boots
put it on the ground and wait for it to come up
you can use the last one to go faster
I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
What if you kill the zombies and get the boots
I remember when I was a kid, I remember
you can go to a place and explore the place
what if we are all just one person?
why are you trying to eat a shoe
You can give him a healing item
Jerma is that a lot of money you got?
why is there a huge selection of games on this
you can use the boots to run faster
Jerma do you know if you're gonna play Mother 3?
This is the last stream of 2020, we have to convince Jerma to play Mother 3
will you do the rest of the game?
Just say you have it on as background noise
do you remember that time you slapped yourself?
can you play that song from the first game
have you seen the new X-wing fighter yet?
You can use the boots to run faster
the people are just trying to save their village
I don't think you can leave this place
I'm really excited for the carnival stream, but I've been waiting for this stream to happen for so long
It's a trick to get the boots
you can use the boots to run faster
you can use the boots to run faster
i hope you have a great time
you have to get the other 2
this game is going to have so many people
you can use the boots to run faster
The boots are for running and jumping
You can use the boots to run faster
he's gonna spill a bucket of wine on his face
You can do the other 2 on this one
They're not trees, they're human bones @Jerma985
the boots are for running and jumping, you don't need to jump
Are you doing the thing where you're sitting in a chair?
You can use the boots to run faster
What did you do to the dog?
Jerma, please play the Darkwood OST, it's really good
I'm gonna get here in 30 minutes :)
I'm pretty sure you can't hear the ground
they
====================
I have a clip of you doing that
It's just the fucking sound of you trying to explain
You have to go to the guy you beat the first time
you can still get the boots, they are much more powerful
i am literally crying, why are you playing this
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROW
this is a bad idea, take the mic
hey jerma can you just play a game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
you can only get it if you've gotten the boots
its like that one episode of spongebob where they eat a whole bar of jelly and they taste like the same thing
what's the best way to learn to do the voice?
You should play the game with your friends
Why are you trying to get me to buy a used car
you're supposed to get the boots first
you can tell they're trying to cover up the fact that you only had the boots
you have to go back and get the boots
stop drinking your own pee, it's bad for you
i'm gonna use this clip as a callout for jerma to be late
i just wanted to be a good boy
you can upgrade it to a better one
The game is a bit slow, but you can get it back up to 1.5x speed with the boots
you can get the boots with the boots
you're the only one that wants to eat that fish
this is like a game about metal gears
he's gonna get his own stream with the same dog
i miss when he would read chat jermaPluto
you can go to the room next to the room
I just got here, why is Jerma playing a game that's been out for like 5 years?
I just want to watch the stream, what is this game
that's a lot of money, they'll pay you back
He's gonna have to do this for the rest of the game LUL
I was gonna say that, but there's been a LOT of complaining from people complaining about it
I wish I had that many points jermaPluto
Are you gonna play that PS4 game with the Xbox One controller?
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE GOBBY TO GET THE DRYER
you can get the boots with the boots
I'm a pleb and I can say that
this is the worst fucking thing you've ever done
You can get the boots with the boots
You can make your own character in this game
i think you got one of those, it's a thing
you can get the boots with the boots
I would rather watch you play minecraft
this is what happens when you dont play my favorite game
when are you gonna play the entire Outlast series
use the boots to get the boots
HE'S GOING TO GET KILLED BY THE END OF THE GAME
I don't know why they don't just kill the zombies in the first place
it's not a good idea to have a tornado watch your stream
you can get the boots with the boots
you can get the boots with the boots
Make a video of the stream where you do the voice
the real question is, are you playing the game or not?
You're going to get banned for using that monkaS
you can get the boots with the boots
your comment is not funny, please stop jermaPluto
you can get the boots with the boots with the boots
use the book to get the boots
I like how the cutscenes are so much worse than the gameplay
you can get the boots with the boots
that's the worst thing you've ever said
You have to go to the guy next to you
The boots are the only way to get the boots with boots
Jerma I would like to get off the board
you can get the boots with the boots with the boots
you can get the boots with the boots with the boots
You
====================
you can't just say you're playing the game
The best way to win is not to play
you gotta get to the part where you die
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys get ready to jup in 5 seconds jermaJup3 jermaJup4
If you beat this game you will be given a rare item
you have to do it in the same spot
you're so good at this game Kappa
i remember playing this game as a kid
my favorite streamer is the one who cant even read
The game was rigged from the start, the runner had to go back to the previous game
when are you going to play stalker?
Jerma, you don't have to play the game to understand it
you can't put a little water in there
this is the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
this is going to be a long stream
the house with a granny in its walls
JERMA THE FASTEST YOU CAN JUMP IS 30 MINUTES
I hope the stream ends with a shitty prerecorded joke about how you're "trying to kill a guy"
you have to do the song again
oh god oh fuck he has airpods in
LUL you didn't even know that was a thing
Jerma I don't think you can do it
your message was not sent because you are sending messages too quickly.
you can keep the winks and then use the "start the stream" button
I'm a little hyped for you to play this game again, I really enjoyed it!
JERMA I KNOW YOU DONT HAVE TO DO THIS
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 20 YEARS
what the fuck is wrong with this guy
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
He's going to accidentally spill the wine
you can do that with a knife
You should play the original version of the game, it's not a sequel
just like the real life, make it
I think the bug's life was invented in New York
you have to get to the top first
If you just read the last 3 books then you'll understand why it's called the Scoobie
You can't do it, we can't see your messages
You can do it with a knife
you can just pick it up and throw it
do you know what a car is
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys get ready to jup in 5 seconds jermaJup3 jermaJup4
this is so boring, it's gonna be like this for weeks
I'm so happy you're playing this game
I feel like this is a really good game
jermaOld I remember when Jerma used to stream
so you're saying you don't have to play it every time?
If you use the confetti on the bridge it will break the shield
LUL HE'S GONNA BE LATE FOR THE NEXT THREE STREAMS
He's not gonna beat it, he's gonna shit his pants
It's only a thing if you don't actually have to play it
you could be streaming Doom now, because that was before the plague hit
you can get the ring by getting a dashing attack
theres a way better way to get the ring
It's a 1 way street, you're not in a shitter
you can't change the difficulty, you have to do the tutorial
I can't believe I'm listening to the same song for an hour
just hold down the buttons while you play
This is a ploy by the game devs to make you play more
do you eat your face off to eat ass?
That's the reason I always liked your streams
I can't wait for the stream where he streams mario maker
dont forget to put the key on the table to activate it
you can hear the tears flowing through his eyes
can we get a "jerma is mad" at jerma
YOU CAN DO IT WITH A KNIFE
I can't believe Jerma is quitting streaming jermaPluto
the music in this game is so fucking good
You can do it with a knife
@
====================
you can tell he is trying to get away
yeah but you have to buy a new camera
jerma you have to go into the menu and press enter to make a save
this is just the end of the game screen
it's like, how many years have you been on the internet?
why does this guy have a full headband
if you don't know what a vowel is, do you know what a letter is?
you can save the game and just go to bed
I love the thumbnail of this game and I'm so glad it's not a video
you can play as the new character
do you have the dlc on steam? @Jerma985
just got here, how many points for a shot of wine?
this is the worst fucking game ive ever played
LUL he's playing a fun game with the devs
theres a new one coming out soon
You need to go back to the room
I'm glad you're finally awake. I'm so tired of hearing about your feet.
is this the guy who died to pinwheel?
there's a new one coming out with a new map
jerma i am a young man with a quest
I want to see Jerma eat a shoe
you have to fight a boss first
you just got caught trying to steal a fishing rod
when you get to the screen, press f6 to flip the game
you can get the boots in the tavern
we want to know what the sun looks like
I can't believe Jerma is still in Anor Londo
what if i want to go to bed right now
"I've got to do all the work"
why is chat so fucking annoying today jermaPluto
they were making a game with AI dungeon
they're just gonna be doing the same thing for the next couple days
you can do it! you can do it!
would you rather eat a whole ass pizza or just eat your ass?
I'm still going to watch your stream to study to, thanks for the great content!
you can get the boots by using the tavern
How many times have we had the same day?
You're not gonna play this for the rest of the stream
you're not supposed to aim for the head, you're supposed to aim for the tail
just got here, why are you talking about your penis
i just realized that jerma is actually a closeted homosexual
HES TRYING TO GET THE DOG TO HATE HIM
this is the only time i've ever heard the word "pot"
if you dont get the boots you will die
I dont know how this game works, but it's good
Why is the sound effect so fucking loud?
Jerma you are going to make me fucking scream
you should play the game for the authentic 2018 Jerma experience
chat please stop being so mean to jerma :(
Jerma, you should try and get a sense of what you're doing
that was the worst thing i've ever heard
This is going to be the best stream of 2020
"just dance to the music of my heart beating"
i'm trying to find the face you used to get the whole game
play the rat level from the rat movie
you can get the boots by using the tavern
do you have any idea what your character's armor is made of?
can you give me a quick rundown on the game so far
I've been here for like 20 minutes and I still don't understand what's going on
we're just trying to make sure that he actually gets it
I can't believe I'm watching this man play a game for the first time
I don't like it when you just talk about the game
why don't you do a steam presentation?
how many times have you said you're doing this
you have to make the jump at the end
you can get boots by using the tavern
I'll go grab some food for you, gnight!
YOU HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR TO GET IT
this is the worst thing you've ever done
Are you going to play Dead Space 2?
this is the worst game of all time
you can do it again with the boots
please put on the new jacket, its very comfy
@Jerma
====================
 2 minutes ago, I'm going back to sleep
do you ever feel like you are the big rat that makes all of the rules?
Jerma's going to die in 5 days, no joke
You should try to build an army and train them
I hope you can get to the top of the building
He's just gonna play the game that's not a real game
theres a way to do that in the game
you can still get a good luck run at the end
jerma you need to get the boots to get the real ending
theres a ladder in the center of the room
you can only do this on the first floor
what about the time you got your mom to order you a new pair of shoes
it's only a matter of time until you go into the dentist
you could've just played some more of the game
play the video of you beating the shit out of a man
Did you see the new Overwatch trailer?
this is one of the best games on the wii
The credits are on the right
YOU CAN DO IT, YOU'RE A TF2 STREAMER
you don't have to watch the stream all the time
i'm getting a bunch of bits right now
You can make your own city, just get a new house and have it own a new city
jerma is a doctor, he cant diagnose his own patients
you can't just have a bunch of kids
You need to unlock more stuff in the game
You can also go into the trees
why does the title say "teach children to hate"
do you ever think the internet will last another 4 years?
why do you think the people are so mad?
this is a fucking Jerma show, i'm unsubbing
YOU CAN DO IT, YOU'RE A TF2 STREAMER
it's okay, we all know you can't be the best at everything
Can you play the game, I have to sleep
you gotta make a new save game now
you can't just say "hey" in the prompt
Jerma, you have to eat the cow in order to get the coin
hey jerma, i'm gonna have to go make dinner, can you do the same
you just had to make him throw up
you can just jump into the water
it's not a dream, it's a full on dream
How the fuck do you get this game on the Wii?
this is just a bad version of the game
Jerma is gonna be so mad when he realizes he lost to Pinwheel
It's okay Jerma, we all know you can't be the best at anything
you're supposed to be in the chair
This is what happens when you don't read the subtitles
The new design for Jerma's face is pretty awesome
no one is going to play this
this game is not even worth the time
you were playing the whole game you dolt
you can do it if you want
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
you're the best gamer of all time
I'm a woman, I don't care about what you think :)
you can have your hair back in your office
I really want to see you play the second one
It was a baby, and he was crying.
I swear to god, all this chat ever does is find the one person with the lowest IQ and copy paste whatever that brainded moron posts.
the way he spoke it was perfect for the game
I can't believe he's gonna do the same thing again LUL
It's a different game, you're on the same level
Just a few of those faces, you're done here
why is this game so fucking hard to watch
theres a save file in the game
theres a free .exe you can play it on your pc
it has been over a year since he played
dont forget to put your facecam on
you have to use the star button on the map
you are in a coma, please wake up
if you want to leave, you can just go into the map and go back to where you came from
you
====================
It's really hard to find the sound clips
jermaOld cant wait to get my old ass
jermaOld hi jerma, how's the stream been today?
I think you just got really mad at the tarantula
I like the "Butterfly" sound effect in this game
I think you have to do something to get the boots
get the damn boots, they're really good
You should put your face cam on the other side of the screen, it's really good :)
imagine if he was a fucking malding streamer
I just realized that Jerma is the only streamer that's been here for 2 hours
I'm glad the bad ones don't come back
this is gonna be a good one for the drew crew
my dad is a firefighter and he said i can't do this anymore
the more you say it the more youre gonna say it
If you're good at something never do it for free
You're gonna get banned from Twitch for saying the word
I hope Jerma makes a return to the TF2 days
You have to hit the 2nd button in the menu
I'm so confused, is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
You're like a grown man with a diaper on, no way you could do this
you can get a car at this level
did you see the new tf2 update
please make the funny voice it's very funny
Dont forget to clean the bodies from the bodies
If you want to kill an animal, you just have to leave the game.
Have you ever played the new open world game, "Star_ Skylines"
you can keep your gift sub money :)
I'm a bit surprised you have a 2 week badge
that's the one that's been in my room for like two weeks
You know what's cool? The sense of achievement on this game.
i only know "jerma" from the creator of jerma
I can't believe the last boss was only for the survivors
just turn on face cam so we can see your pogs
i would just do it in the discord
I'm pretty sure Jerma is just making up his lies to cover up his bald spot
i think jerma actually wants to play this game
I'm surprised you have a 2 week badge
use the rat voice actor to make a rat movie
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
You have to do the voice again
you're gonna die and die and die
You're not gonna get the boots are you
Jerma I'm a furry, please stop with the stream
you have to press the buttons on the game
i was just looking at the wink and thought to myself "I'm gonna wink"
you can put the plastic in the cartridge and then you can put the plastic in the disc
jerma would rather stream himself getting slimed than have a good game
I bet you can't even find the right one
i'm still waiting for the second stream of this
you can use the iron golem to get around
You can also put it on a bucket with a bucket on it.
I'm a furry and I love you
what if you need to go to the bathroom and piss
This is going to be a disaster
This is the most intense game of all time
if you're good at something never do it for free
I think he was trying to get to the next level
im trying to eat but im dummy thicc
we're in the endgame now its time for the challenge
he's not even here, he's just on his way
this is the best thing to happen to the stream
The movie is the only way to watch it, so it's okay.
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I'm not really sure but I think you can climb the slide if you're using a grappling hook
you need to get some of the items
this is going to be a disaster LUL
jermaOld I remember when I was a kid
why does he keep doing the same thing over and over again
jermaSun JERMA, JERMA, GET DOWN WITH THE SHIT jermaSun
you just played a game with like 7 viewers
it's a lot of money to make a real restaurant
jerma please
====================
i need to go to sleep can someone help
I'm gonna be honest, the last two missions are kinda the same
you can see the hulk's teeth in the top left
is this the streamer that beat the jump king challenge on stream?
put a bunch of pictures of your face
I can't believe I'm watching a VOD PogChamp
its not just the camera its also the sound you make when you fly
You can do that in any game with like 4 buttons
you can do a lot of shit with that controller
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 534. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I would love to see this game again
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure that's what i expected
If you have the game on, you should play this
I just got here and I already know this is a joke
why is this game such a fucking pain in the ass
theres a secret on the top right
he'll be the one to die in the first 20 seconds
You just put on the voice of an old man
you can actually play a lot of this
you're still gonna be up at 3pm
jerma, i have a question for you. why are you making a toddler dance with a car
hey guys im watching a vod and its pre stream chat, what do i do?
I'm in your room and I'm about to die
what if you made a big show and you made a giant show?
you know what would be the worst stream of the year?
This is the dark souls of video games
jerma is going to be a new president
you should play one of the super mario rpgs
How can you even do that, you are going to die
just like a booger every morning at 7 AM
I don't think he knows how to make a gun
it's just a bad ending, the devs just made it to a movie
jerma do you eat ass or is it just me
I'm going to bed, thanks for the stream!
theres a secret in the car, its in the other car
you have to click on the guy
i am so glad i can catch a stream today
I'm glad he's back, I'm gonna miss him
he said if you dont want to play it, you can play it
You're a hero, you can do anything
the guy below me is a fucking moron
HE'S LYING ABOUT HIS PENIS STREAM D:
you can use it to scout with the scout button
theres a secret in the car, its in the other car
He was like "I'm so glad I got here"
i think you need to go to the bathroom
he's going to be the one to die in the first 20 seconds
you can do it in one of two ways
i love how the game is just going to have this screen
Why do you have your kids do this to you?
he's just gonna get out of the car
how many times have you said that you're gonna play more resident evil?
jerma if you dont do it im unsubbing
dont forget to take your meds before the colonoscopy
this is the worst thing i have ever seen
jerma stop this is just an ad for the game
it was a good joke and you were great
i wish i could make a good emote
why are you playing the fucking video game
you can also use the stone sword to knock down walls
"I'm gonna take a shit and go to the bathroom"
hey guys, just got here. I'm very excited for today's stream :)
it was a good joke and you were great
i hope jerma plays the new sonic game
If you want to buy stuff, you can just buy a bunch of stuff and get a new car.
did you know that Jerma is a professional actor?
just got here, why is this streamer so greasy?
you can use it to scout with the scout button
you have to touch the gas pump button
I can't wait for the next night of streams
I'm watching a VOD and I don't know what's going on
You can also use it to scout with the scout button
you can also use it to scout with the scout button
i have a
====================

you need to make sure you have enough inventory space
he's going to be playing this for the next hour
this is like a game where you need to be able to find a way to get past the tutorial
it's the same as if you were playing this on the ps4
You're doing a great job, Jerma! A GREAT JOOOB!
What about the stuff you keep in your closet
You have to get it first to unlock the secret
you're not even wrong, the game is rigged, but you're wrong
look at the top left of your hand
you could have just done the other options, but this game is rigged
I just want to know what you think
I love how you've only been playing this for like 5 hours
I've been here for the past 2 hours
This is just a shitty 90s anime game
you can turn it off in the settings
he's gonna be streaming for another 2 hours
is this the game that beat jevil first try on stream?
if you don't have a good team you won't have any

You gotta get a real education to be a professional
i cant believe this streamer is still playing this game
I'm gonna go buy some food, start the stream, and then start the stream
you can turn it off in the settings
You look like a fucking ghoul now
jerma you cant just say "why" and not try to figure it out
I love how they keep the audio down
You should be doing the "let's go to the bathroom" bit again
you are not a real gamer, you are a fake gamer
What if you turned on the streamer cam and you were actually a real gamer
hey can you play the theme to this game
we all know you are a fake gamer
You are an actual gorilla, just don't eat it.
dont forget to go to the red door
You should try to find a Puddle of Life
you have to be 21 to use the n word
There is a mod that adds all of the characters
hey jerma can you say "PogChamp" again
i cant believe you didnt do the vroom
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game and not the actual game
the game just goes on and on
you can get your own custom emote if you want
So you're the guy that got beatboxed by the guy with the bomb
jermaHeart I'm so happy to see you here
there is a game called "The Two Towers" that you can play
you can turn it off in the settings
i cant wait for the stream to start
can you say "haha" for the rest of the stream
I don't think it was a bad joke, but it was a very bad joke
just let the skeletons carry you jerma
LOOK AT THE SCREEN JERMA ITS TOO LOUD
I can't believe this is the same guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream
You should do a private stream with Etalyx and Ster, it's very relaxing
It was just a joke. This is a real thing.
Dude, we have to be having fun now
i'm in the bathroom, what did i miss
You're already in the red, you can't keep going
you can do the "second" part of the level
how did you get such good at this game

The Wii is really good, you should try it

You can make it as small as you want in the game

The game was rigged from the start. The game was rigged from the start.
hey jerma can you give me a quick rundown on the game so i can make an essay on it

you have to use the b button on your mouse to click it
you can buy a lot of things from the shop
you just posted cringe you know it

you can find it on the menu at the top right
I had a dream where I was in the bathroom and the fucking door fell off

you need to get the boots first
I'm actually surprised you didn't just put your hand on the table to pick up that spear
You can use the bow to kill zombies
You can use the b button to click the screen.
is the audio fucked up for anyone else?
why are you trying to break the game
This is what happens when you dont have a good time
jerma is a millionaire and cant afford to go to the dentist jermaPluto
i can't believe you would do this to me
that was the worst fucking joke you've ever made
that's like saying you have a big tummy
You are just a bad parent, I dont blame you
it's because you're an old man in a wheelchair
this is so fucking sad. i love it
Jerma you have to have the gun
when are you going to play tf2?

This game is great and all, but when is the next Dead Space?
"I'm just gonna run away from this guy"
I have to go to bed, see you in the VOD

Jerma is playing as a single player character in this game
you have to play as the real bb unit
you can use the b button to click the screen

This game is like a fucking fever dream
You're doing a good job! You're doing a good job!

do you know what a bow looks like?
I can't believe Jerma just showed up for a pee break

You have to get the boots first
the sand is going to come in and kill you

====================
You're the one who gets things done around here
I'm so glad I got to see it
I thought this was gonna be a chill stream today
I'm just here for the Jerma stream. I'm here for the Jerma chat.
I'll give you a high five if you don't finish this game :)
i have a feeling this is gonna be a good one
Play "My name is Jeremiah Ninehundred and Eighty Five"
If you're not here in an hour, you're not here in an hour
but I didn't know that, it's not like I have a lot of time to catch them
you got a bad feeling about it huh?
you can get the bell at the inn, you can get the bell from the innkeeper
I'm so glad that this game is finally getting a sequel
I'm gonna go back to the past
this is like the worst thing i've ever seen
JERMA YOU CAN PICK IT UP IN THE MORNING
play the rest of the game, it's a great game
Is this the streamer that beat the God of War on stream?
you have to do it in the next 5 minutes
I think you can use the grenade launcher
I don't know why I'm so upset, I just want to play the game
you can get a job at a hotel
jerma, you're literally the only streamer that has ever been on a rollercoaster
you can go into the dungeon and look for chests

this game is a lot like doom eternal
I don't know if you're kidding, but this game is kinda fun
You can do that in real life you know
You can do that in real life
They're trying to make a bomb game
jermaWalk on my way to get some free crack
this is the most generic game ever made
what kind of icecream do you get from a frozen pizza?
go to the bathroom, we don't want you here
you guys are all just trying to get attention
I'm not a girl, I'm a girl :)
you should have a big red one next to your username
You have to buy a bunch of upgrades, it's the same as buying the normal game
jerma just said that he has 2 more streams to go
This game is so good for its time
why are you playing this, you know this
you have to beat the first level
can you explain what the fuck is going on
This game has so much content, I can't wait for him to play it
YOU'RE THE GUY IN THE GAME DON'T SAY THAT
you have to beat the first level
If you say "WINK" I'll donate $200
he said that a few times, he'll do it again
i dont think you can get past the first level
you have to do the entire level
I think you need to get more boots
I have a feeling that the Labo stream is going to be a 24 hour stream
Is this the streamer that beat Pinwheel on stream?
is it a virus or a virus out of the box?
its an actual art piece, you dont need to be a genius to draw it
I'm pretty sure you can get the boots from the green guy in the shop
"Why are you playing this game" "I hate this game"
you're not supposed to use the grenade launcher
this is what happens
====================
The guy on the right looks like a 1950s car salesman
you are going to lose your gamer license
I remember when Jerma said he was gonna play Katana zero
what if you get a gift sub
I'm not going to lie, I'm not even gonna watch this
you can turn the difficulty to hard, just change the difficulty
jermaOld How do I get a twitch prime sub?
jerma the only way to win is not to play
this is a really good game but its not gonna be good for streaming
is this a joke or a real game?
Jerma, the yellow one is the only one you're still using
I can't believe you beat this game in one try, you're the only one I've ever seen that's played it
did you try the new pineapple pizza?
I wish they made an anime game like this
you should play the TF2 ost. it's so good
You're just a moron for playing a game that is not the main game, and you're not going to win.
how does this game have an advanced AI
its okay jerma just look at the top left
You know you can have your own stream right?
do you have a favorite game that you wanna play?
you can combine the armor and the shield
how did he get a gold key for the game?
i'm gonna make a bad joke
that's like a 10 second video of you eating
How did this game come to be but with a 4 foot rat?
YOU'RE GOING TO KILL THE DOG ITS ALREADY DEAD
You can make a fire in the forge
are you gonna play the new season of monster rancher?
It's not a full moon chat, he's streaming early
jermaOld how do I turn off the stream
you need to start the game now
This is gonna be a good one to watch
we need a new emote, like the one jermaPain
I thought it was a new emote
This is gonna be the whole stream LUL
jerma you are not a true gamer
If you like this game, play the other one. It's like the sequel but less boring.
Iâ€™m so fucking glad you are playing this
Jerma you've been playing this for an hour and youâ€™re still not done
oh i thought that was a good joke
you can combine your two arms to form a full sword
he's just saying that to make us feel better
i was gone for a while what happened
You look like you've been in a coma for like 20 years
your poop is just a giant chunky ball of flesh
There's an achievement for beating this level
that's how you get a controller that's what you do
have you ever had a patty on the lips?
i love that the people in this game are like "oh fuck"
You can go to the mines and find the one that gives you a free item
hey jerm, im going to the store to buy some ramen, what is it called
I can't believe I'm watching this, am I right guys
you're going to get a hernia

you're gonna need to buy the tickets for the carnival stream
Jerma you need to go to the side of the road and come back to it
I have to get to work in about 15 minutes
This is just like the other game LUL
You're the only one that needs to be in a coma
this game is so fucking boring I love it
You can use your fireball to dash and hit people
is it true you're a furry now?
I wanna see jerma play a new game
i want to get off Mr. Peanut's wild ride
theres a big difference between the 2 and the 2
That was the funniest thing I've ever seen
you can just talk to the gate lady
You can get a new house if you can get a new door
I think he said it was a good game, but I don't think it's going to be a good one
it's a lie, you can't read chat
====================
why is it called the zoo? is it just a zoo
how do you feel about a lot of people saying you're bad at games
Why are you using a pistol in the same spot as the guy who's throwing you?
He's gonna do the "crush a crayon" bit
is this the streamer that beat that boss on stream
It's not a secret anymore, he's just a different person
I'm gonna go to bed, good night everyone
i have a question for you jerma, how do you even do that?
this is like when you had a car accident
This is going to be a disaster, like the last
I'm really glad you're playing this game, you're not gonna be able to do anything special tomorrow.
I'm sure you will get a better one.
you gotta get on the top of it
did you get all of the borgs
I think you can just save and quit the game
it was originally the previous 4, but this is the last one
You can still put the oil in the tank
i'm getting flashbacks of that scene in the movie where the movie was about a guy who just got stabbed
He's got a really bad case of gamer neck
If you're good at something never do it for free
I mean, you can just watch a youtube video of it
jerma if you don't stream today I'm going to fucking scream
why does the guy in the bottom right look like a version of himself
you could make a sword out of the ashes
you have to play more of this
this is gonna be a 10 hour stream
I like how this is a bit off the beaten path of the game
I'm not a big fan of the bloodborne boss fight
can't wait for the "jerma is going to die" joke
go to the castle and kill the last skeleton
You're like an undertaker right now :)
You can use the "Seagull" extension to see your save file
we're gonna go from 100 to 100 and he'll get mad
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 994. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
just do the same thing over and over again
Jerma, you're the only one with a voice
he just wants to be happy and happy
how much is this game for you jerma
i want to be the one guy jermaPluto
you can get a second controller for the d-pad
I'm sorry I'm late, but I'm not even a fan of your playthrough of Clock Tower 3.
you were just standing still, but now you're not still standing
the first time jerma played a video game
why would you need a chainsaw in a game
you can tell it's bad if you have a third eye
This is going to be the whole stream
if you get to the top of the castle you can level up your troops
oh i gotcha. i don't even know what a child is. i just remember it being a joke
Oh man, I just got here. Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
jerma is gonna say something really stupid tonight
I dont know what you're talking about but i am having a great time, i am so excited for this stream
why are you playing this game as a youtube video
you were so excited about the other games
can you play one of the other games i missed
i dont know if this is a joke or not LUL
You need to save your energy for the next stream
I'm a doctor, I see what you mean
I hope jerma puts on the clothes again
how many bits for you to tell us the truth?
I'm going to have to look at a medical doctor tomorrow, please be patient.
Why is Jerma playing a second game after this?
You have to get the right controller first
you got a whole chat to watch :)
jerma can't even remember the last time he played a video game LUL
I can't believe you got a dragon
you need to save your energy for the next stream
why does this game have a giant black hole
JERMA IS GOING TO GET THE SHIT ON HIS MIC
jermaOld_SG i'm out of the loop, he's trying to get me to play league of legends
I'm
Jerma, please play the game, I need a break
why is this chat so horny right here
theres an old man below her head
why would a man be a porn artist
Why are you doing this to me, please stop LUL
That's the real one from the game
The real one was the game. I like it.
I'm not sure I expected it to actually catch on fire
i dont care if you do it or not
I dont watch streams unless it gets a streamer
jerma this is a game why would you do that for porn
jerma the dog has a heart attack you ding dong
the best part of the game is still urinals
you'll get it out of the way before everyone explodes
He didn't get it out of the way because it wasn't on the map
i think ive watched it a couple of times it seems pretty fun tho, it really shows
I'm so glad you didn't take it easy on yourself.
hey jerma i hope you liked the vod :)
I was only here for the bit badge thing
You can make an ice cube with this, its much faster
if you're a big fan of Jojo, you may want to try this one
the only good thing about this movie is the music
Jerma you've got like 5 hours in this game and you're literally playing this
you dont put in a fucking 2 star sign lol
It's the same voice as that one game you played. You're the bad guy
@yoyu__ that makes it way more complicated as you try and solve it
I just saw in a stream where a boomer named jerma is playing a game thats so bad, what a psycho
how many times have you killed yourself? like 5 minutes
just wait until he finds out he can shoot yourself when all shots are empty again PepeHands
I didn't get what I was looking for
theres literally a whole different level for him for free, there's like a week to go to
@DivusP It's the only good VR game you didn't play
hey guys. I'm trying to watch JoJo's Bizarre adventure.
Jerma can you explain to me the purpose of the pee pee poo poo emote?
no they never are they have to eat one
I mean, I have a good case study for it
I just had a few people say that shit in chat
Is this the streamer that got hit by a car LIVE?
the fuck theres no way in hell that would work
"Hey guys, i get a flight tomorrow afternoon"
i just got back in and he is making a funny noise?
its a shame they didnt do more green eggs
hey guys howd i get that jermaDafoe bit
This is the one where you play as a boomer trying to figure it out
it has to be that shit at the beginning OMEGALUL
he's only looking around the corner, what do you get from a 3 min intro
Why would anyone like this guy? All I get is that he's a Boomer
What is this I have to get through the game so fast?
why don't you just use the spear like that
that's not a fucking gun, that's just a fucking regular flamethrower
I can barely imagine jerma playing minecraft like this LUL
This place is like having three bathrooms
can you pause i need to go to the bar
Jerma I didn't beat this game because you're bad jermaDisgust
imagine not having a sub jerma not playing this
this is the real jerma in the head
is this a remake of "this is not my dream" "what do I do"
jermaSour is now the sourness, now he has to eat the dog
i am now watching Jerma985 in 2019 by far
the fact that jerma is going to be late is making me feel bad for him
It's my birthday in 10 years, thanks for to remember my name
I think its better just to not go back
if we dont tell the mods at least one game sux
jerma you missed like 90% of the movie
just play the game at the same time
oh god damn how is this stream not live?
i guess if he doesnt start in 5 minutes I will be fine with a new emote :)
this isn't even a good game anymore LUL
You can use melee to clean up the trash you get
you got to the boss with the best weapon in the game
i've never seen this guy in a real
 row is just a big ass one
you will win if it's 1 or 3
Jerma985, when will you make some games? :)
I don't want to live in the desert :)
This is not the streamer that beat the game. This is only the stream jermaFireman
I think i should get one for a friend
imagine how much money you'll have next time
jermaWalk THIS IS THE END OF THE STREAM jermaWalk
I like how you cant do this in real life
jermaWalk the stream is over and the viewer count has increased by like 50%
theres like two towers of a different kind
I'm just gonna call every single one of them. No need to explain why
I was here just now but I think he's already been muted by himself in his room
You could do a really interesting voice for this boss too, you just get this joke too late
that's not very hard to think about, but idk
the one I saw was "jermaWalk" that was the worst name ever
I'm excited to be the one asshole who calls me a slur
The sound effects in this game remind me of something from that song
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
he's just talking to himself, he needs help
when you run up the hill you get a special bonus
i don't like how youve got this game out of the tutorial
That's what happens when you put the whole chat in sub only mode LUL
i thought I heard a voice to my right
it's like that "jerma wants it all" meme
jermaSour the best part of today's stream was jermaSun
jermaVenus I don't know why i get so excited about a streamer making fun of me. Im a pleb
You'll get so tired and sick of having your internet go out tomorrow
the most important part of this mission is going back the way you came to
That's not even a real dream, that's an imagined dream
This is what your brain looks like LUL
we must demand his hand be put down
you've never played the game before? :) you're a boomer
that's what i thought when i started playing games
how many times do we have to get to the bottom of this before you go live please respond
that person has a gun and won't shoot
Jerma can you put on some ear headphones please
Is this the guy who got MELD OUT on STREAM?
it's not the whole story this part, there's another level to it anyway
JERMA STOP I AM DYING OF HONSTINESS THIS IS SCARY
@dabsfordinner I'm so glad you're using it when you should be doing all aus game like the series
how do you put so many people in a home
If you get a few guys to shoot a sniper, you can do this
what happened to Jerma? i missed it :(
He's just getting his face ripped off by the voodoo doll :)
he can only do one but hes the one
@TovarischNick i mean its literally a stream lmao
its always been a joke to me. i try and make people uncomfortable though
if you get a few people to shoot them then it's not as bad as it seems
this is the best, my favorite movie of all time
you really are a fucking idiot, this joke is being wasted too much.
You can't have a baby when it's a corpse
why do you want to do this to us?? D:
so you have a whole lot of free money
how the fuck did i see him in chat?
i wanna see you eat the shoe :)
@shelby_kun i don't even know what its about anymore
this is why YOU're bad at video games
i used to use it for my birthday
you guys are not allowed to leave chat, hes getting the bad end
I remember when Ster was a funny man
hey guys what happened to the stream i missed :) :)
It's like a 10 hour stream every day @Jerma985
i hate when i see someone who says "this guys"
jerma is gonna show us what he got
I love how Jerma is just standing in the center of town and just walking like this
jermaTV is a great emote to try to capture all of our faces
The next community night is on Sunday. jermaPluto
why did they not do a stream? they did this all themselves
I hope you're going to need another pair of your own right now
jermaOld How do i find the internet?
 tigers is an actual monster
i'm so fucked that i hope i didn't lose a wink or two
This is one of the BEST streams imo
i got a nunchuck on my face and it just went off again
i think you're too good for this world
I think the mods just want to see you win
I like how you're in a bad mood
the audio is too loud for you @LanoBelsho
i just started the stream and just got here, what have you done about the poopbutt?
i want to see u pee on the floor :)
I mean, he was a good comedian, but that's like 90% his personality.
i was about to say it was good
it's a good thing I never played it
it has to go, the game is pretty good
you might need to change it in your car
What do you think of the new TF2 update?
can you please stop going down the stairs
you said it looked like a tree
its the most embarrassing thing on the whole site that jerma hasn't seen in months monkaS
isnt this the guy that beat Dark Souls 3?? LUL
Jerma and the Gorilla at the top of the tower, one of the best games
I left for a bit what is happening
jerma you gonna read this on stream? @Jerma985
this sounds like the end of the level but with the music
if you lose at the next game you get the key
You have literally nothing to lose, but your friends
You just need to buy more guns, like what are you talking about? :)
Why is this streamer so mad he is in the game?
oh yeah you can play all of those on stream
it would suck if u didnt get rid of jerma's shirt
Can I see a picture of your asshole please?
"what are we doing guys, this is just a test"
He said if he had been playing it I would have already done it
have you ever thought about doing a stream around the carnival stream?
how long have you been streaming jerma you're a sick fuck youve got to start streaming sooner
why are you listening to the wrong streamers
why do you keep getting timed out for saying that about yourself?
I just hope we get more streams like that
It's a good thing, all it took was for a guy to make a mistake and somebody noticed it @Jerma985
it says if youre not being timed out youre not being timed out
Jerma said he would beat this in like 3 days
I want to say something about this stream that Jerma has taken an arrow to the knee as his only remaining outlet
that actually sounds like it's from the beginning of the video LUL
just go kill some nazis, they have more range now
I think it's probably just the virus or whatever
its the most weeb thing i've ever seen
Jermas making the most insane thing that ever happened LUL
is this your first time playing a DOS game
i hope you all have a great night <3
imagine if you did that and didn't get any of it
Jerma your mom is crying at you trying to play with you on the toilet
please explain why you play games and how you can fail
it's so much better for the first game
Jerma you are getting a headache for not doing it
do you not know what an oat smells like btw
Jerm it's almost 30 here in Texas, can you hurry?
this is like a worse city zoo game
Just get the coin, you already got 3 coins
JERMA JEESUS CHRIST JERMA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PLEASE WAKE UP, IM BREASY AND I LOVE YOU
@Carnie200 he does not care, we know it lmfao
You're getting timed out for saying that about yourself
can you do a tier list of your tier lists? :)
can you play this without jumping off the cliff?
If you dont kill the boss that could be your main skill
I love having a bunch of money to spend on a single game, like the casino or whatever
He should be playing a real game of thrones game LUL
i saw you in the middle of the movie
jermaWalk ANY CRACK CRACK CHICKS IN CHAT? jermaWalk
He is literally the worst character in all of LOTR
LIVE ACTION STREAM FROM THE VEGAN
Please make a level with the skeleton crew
how did you know how to cook @Jerma985
Is the guy with the big arms okay?
@mikeweiner i'm something of a weeb, i hate it
This dude is gonna fall of his chair lmao
Jerma why did you make this game so hard?
@yenwenlen did it get fixed or have the bad end happened now?
why is there a dude all fucked up?
its just a picture of jerma's asshole LUL
@Vynixa it's a game that takes a long time to understand, so the speedrun is usually a few hours LUL
I need to hear how much the game pisses me off
have you ever seen this game in a real life game like The Movies?
This isn't something you get over a year like the others?
There are more people going through those fires, what happened to what was in them, why did they all die?
im glad i got to see jerma play minecraft
If Jeremy is so good, where's the rest of us
how many more minutes until he figures it out
Jerma985 i believe the game is telling you to go in this room
he's got a bit of a weird mustache hair on his face
Jerma, you know if anyone wants to join my discord server :) https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985/clip/GoodMildingLuminescentMoon
it's so small it doesn't need to be the entire entire screen
I love how this is the plot to "The Ring" with Jerma
I don't know what you're talking about, Jeremy. Just a guy
Can't believe it's 6 am in the UK
What do you think Kim's face on that picture was meant to mean?
this is probably my favorite part of the jerma vids
why did he say no more? what does he intend for tonight
I bet you can't be serious if you have no experience with any of these
i know you are but i dont think you are
jermaWalk im walking up the stairs and everyone is getting outta there
please beat it like an amateur, nobody wants to watch it.
do you think we could do a seaman emote?
you have literally gone to prison and youre going to jail for it @Jerma985
you need to play a game similar to this game so there will be no problems
we have an official game for a new pc
why is he doing this to himself every time
I've got nothing else to do but watch jerma. I’ll watch the green screen stream next
what if everyone turns out to be bots all along
jerma i love you, you're my favourite streamer and i love your videos :)
I don't even know what the fuck this is OMEGALUL
it didnt sound right, they were talking about the same note
we will need to get the game over now
the game says you can kill monsters in groups of 10 and kill others and make up your own group
I wonder if anyone is making a porn game that jerma would be great at
This dude can actually take the boss and win
is this the guy who lost to jump king??
This is the game that gave you the ability to eat in 3 days :D
it doesnt work like this in real life Kappa
jermaWalk SoSnowy just a random sneezing snowmourch in my room monkaS
i like jerma as a tuber. he's the best
do you remember that you were gonna play the game today or are you forgetting right now? :)
"it's not that bad" what did they do to you
I'm not a fan of the food either, it's so overly sweet and salty to taste
why does he keep his camera, he has a gambling addiction jermaHeart
jerma should play the nancy drew 2 ost
i cant wait to watch jerma take a dump today
jerma should be in a different casino now
the fact that some people are calling this a penis makes me very uncomfortable lmao
Is there an option to change this to the OST? @Jerma985
@garbQ now you just have to read the message
is joel the one guy who doesnt show up to his own party
what would a stream today be like limesPls
It's my birthday today, can you please sing happy birthday to this family :)
oh yeah we need a JUP STORM, it'll start the next stream!
"imagine not getting a sub and then being a sub
 psycho time
this game actually had a bad ending
I heard Jerma will NEVER play No More Heroes 2
Did you learn from your mistakes and realize it was a bit boring to watch jermaPluto
it has to be a jerma joke or else we'll all riot
oh boy this is gonna be a good one
I like how this game made him do that
This is like in every country in the world
why is she running when she doesn't need to
i thought this was a picross game but its a simpsons game jermaFear
The only thing that hurts my eyes when I look out is a giant snake
you guys are like a bunch of kids now jermaPluto
what if she has a foot fetish
Do the next episode or riot LUL
this makes more sense than the new animal crossing
is this not the game where you throw stuff ?
just dont give in to us just use jermaSour <3
is this what you do for a living
you need to have a special key
Why did you put so much time and energy into this LUL
JERMA PLEASE STOP STOOGING. WE CAN'T HAVE A GAME LIKE THIS.
just play the game normally it's fine
@Tingy the other one is a joke, the one with the snake was the REAL one
they're gonna put Jerma in a gorilla costume
why does twitch want you so bad at their streams ?
you said you want to be the worst gamer on twitch
Is this the guy who lost to pinwheel ?
it makes the noise for me and theres a lot of it going on around me!
this is probably the most stressful Jerma's ever played out there
jerma you should play as ster as he's so cool
did you ever find the good ending
you are a little short of the end
this is like when you go to the store and it makes you feel like you are in a fever dream
he's just saying all this because he has to be late
jerma's face cam, what a gamer man jermaOld
this has just become the stream of the year
you can go to the other side where your health is fucked up LUL
it's a boston house so you gotta have the right angle view
imagine being a chef who wants to be chef
the only thing that's changed is the streamer. i cant tell you anything now
There were a lot of people complaining about fart jokes
you need to be aware of where the slime is getting left
is today gonna be the new year or something?
i feel like we are getting really far
It was really good. This might be the only good hulk game.
You have to wait a week longer Jerma.
You have no idea how to get into a game
This is a great game I can believe it. Thank you Jerma!!!
im pretty sure that makes me smile every day of my life
i cant believe this is your only stream in the last 40
You got some hot sauce and hot fries I think
I went outside and saw one of the carnies in the background who was screaming "LOOG" as I watched and laughed
Why is chat so active today chat? I want to talk with him FeelsBadMan
why did the game have to be so highkey?
what he called the cow 'big dick'
you can say that on the whole stream
It looks like you've never had a colonoscopy.
you should do a 24 hour stream where you play Nancy Drew jermaIQ
this is the most intense voice acting I've ever heard
this boss really gets boring after 20 minutes
Do your best impression of the narrator
you need to find your brother with the keys to the lock
@IamMunkk thanks for the gift sub my ass
I will go and watch a movie now.
@Futurgamr1 you would think a whole week would pass
i know, we all need to chill out to relax to that :) https://clips.twitch.tv/BibleCastyTriumphantCrat
"I like this stream so i cant stop watching, thanks for the amazing stream. Here's to a cool, full video"
this is the hardest thing ive ever cried to
Is this what it’s like to live in this world?
just use it from my car alarm
Jerma, are you going to play the new
i only played the one guy because he has big feet, so i don't have to follow him
What were the odds that youd win? Did jerma end up beating his meat by himself on stream?
do not do the last mission, it is a boss fight
is this game worth doing after watching you in an arcade
Jerma can you go to the other side of my screen
it's literally the same as every other game
@bomber_0 It's weird that people still think this is like a weird, generic sim. but that they are so passionate about the sim
it is really cool that this isn't out yet.
can we please go for the whole stream
you don't have to do this you can just keep changing your name :)
@joshbrin2000 did you get the good one from the same guy
what am i gonna get in for work today
it's a big, big, good movie for the first place
I've been in that car once, it was a blast
Why is an arcade room so expensive OMEGALUL
is jerma not an alien for that? LUL
This is so hard to understand. What did I just walk in on?
i wish chat could say a few words about this.
just eat them before they kill you jerma
why is this man just taking shots of glass
he sounds like he's about to do something dumb like that
why is jerma only playing the dos games?
what do you think the game is? I'm hungry too.
Jerma I hope your teeth are fine now so you can go explore
you cant make out his nose when you do that
you should get one of the new game models and textures
This is the worst voice acting ive ever heard
he just goes in and out after taking a few steps. every 10 secs
what happens to chat when you delete channel messages
oh fuck yes I've got this stream on my browser :)
i like how hes doing his best to hide his disgust
This was one of my favorite childhood games
can I just say this is a fucking great game
i have a confession though, the movie night streams are really good
just wait until someone calls jerma LUL is this a prank
Why does this game remind me of the original hit sonic adventure
we cant keep him from having fun with this
can you take a picture of us with this
this movie is a lot like a horror movie
how can it be different, i just joined
jerma is going for a long pee pee
Jerma I’m getting very tired you have to do a bit
"I can't beat the whole thing" -Jerma's chat
i wish my friends and family could have gone with jerma instead of jerma
oh my god that was a good bit
is he the last one at the end of the stream?
that guy just ran over a kid :)
have you ever made yourself a sandwich and put your hands together
You know how all these casinos use that one casino for slot machines?
@Tasty_turd he still has that one dude named "The Thing"
i'm sure its true, jerma is never streaming again
you don't have to do this shit yourself...
it's the guy who beat pinwheel first try
you never see any of the games i made
i hate how hard he says it its the game youre using to be confused jermaMars
isn't there a game that plays it that plays audio
why cant you make yourself do it like that
Do "no shit its a bad place"
yeah im gonna play more viva pinata until jerma plays it anyway
can you do one speed run of this game please? thanks :)
jerma has had the virus before, he should get rid of it
oh damn I thought it was you right there
why don't we have the nappy hat instead
The next character to make a comeback is Jerma
jermaWalk O F E E D jermaWalk
The game gives you the ability to open packs when you have enough packs.
You should go see something about the people who have been gone recently
yeah, it just makes it easier to do a bit
if you are good at something never do it for free
Are you doing the old version of Halo Reach?
You get to say "You're not going to play the new game with no input" instead of "You're going to" now
why would you think about jerma as you play a video game are all you ever do is play video games
 believe they can be that easily too, but i love their hard work
if you don't do it on accident you are WRONG LMAO
I have no friends i am going to die :(
darn I have some more games to play I hate them
Is it possible to make me laugh more than I would a real game? :)
I heard the devs of this game want to return to it, but that is the only reason they do it
I’m eating raw potatoes i love it
I still know that you had a pretty good job as a substitute teacher. You've been good for a long career <3
He got the entire population down so he can go play minecraft LUL
is it going to be today chat or tomorrow?
"I am so glad that this is a great game." -Ludo the Leech
Jerma is just the one guy in the whole universe that can't actually type at all
I just got here and holy fuck I can't believe it happened that way jermaPluto
its the worst joke because everyone is dead :)
Are you ever going to stream Kenshi again?
Why does chat keep posting these things LUL
It'd be dope if people were saying "i don't wanna see them!" and "theres a reason why theres no jerma!"
the vinny streams have been a fucking wild rollercoaster after the second channel he made
Jerma you're going on an airplane. You're gonna live on the bus
I wish Jerma would play Simpsons hit and run on stream jermaPluto
I have a very healthy fetish :) but it is not a fetish :)
you need a little bit of money to upgrade your weapons
I can't believe this streamer is streaming RIGHT now
jerma is actually a huge liar and he's going to go to prison for it
Jerma I thought something is up with you today
@CreamCorn31 Thats how I thought at the time
is this the jerma985 vod or an archive LUL
i thought that guy on the right was dead.
This is an interesting game. I hope you enjoy it :D
i can't believe the game is this fun and fun
i had coffee for like 10 minutes straight but you were good
I'm going to call the FDA, they are going to kill me monkaS
the stream over noise is giving me a heart
YOU ALREADY DONE A BULLET BANG ON HIS ASS
This looks like one of those scary anime girls
if you go any closer and have a ballpit near the door, you get a special powerup that lets you have your hands move on the floor LUL
You're probably looking at people from the other side of the room
they dont want all your content im sorry jerma
What happened to a stream of cooking simulator for jerma????
You're not supposed to do this so you can beat me.
what kind of boomer doesnt want to have all these games open so many more tabs
you can't get the first rank in the last game in it's way
just found out I could go to mars for 10 hours jermaPluto
they're gonna fucking throw us out now jermaPluto
you're not the same as a child IRL
i like all types of food for a reason,
can we get a link to that link
I wish I could find jerma.s streams at my pc
can we be friends until he streams and then we can be banned
that's the last you see of them, now on your watch
what the fuck is going on in this town
i was laughing so hard at that
is he actually going to do the vive stream?
you can get some pretty good loot in this game
I dont wanna watch that guy play Kenshi again and it will probably be just him for the next 2 hours
jerma should have a chat filter set if it didnt make it
I've been gone for 2 hours, how late is his stream today?
there's more like a third house than the first LUL
this music is the fucking worst for me.
I used to work for Microsoft and it was a nightmare
but for some reason I can't play them
they only exist where is it on the map now
that was funny for a second, because i guess jerma is a comedy genius now jermaIQ
hey jerma can you play some halo reach at some point?
dont play that game you won't see it from there, it is a fake game
you're supposed to get a key if you get a key
isn't there like a single thing in the world that is a really good item
I would legit kill someone to get the boots. FeelsBadMan
it's a game a man would play at some point
you have been playing for over 1 hour right tonight
This is the worst streamer i've ever seen.
i am really bored, what is this shit
Jerma's brain is making the same noises over and over
is there a stream title on the screen?
how can one man be so wrong :(
theres a 2 in the top right i'm gonna check my pants
He doesn't say anything because his mind is in shambles
jerma has a special twitch app on his phone
the vod is getting to him already OMEGALUL
i'm gonna cry if I sub but I don't care jermaPluto
Jerma your hair looks like its in The Shire
that's some shite jermaSun i bet he didn't see the game
He could beat the game and we wouldn't care
I'm going to drink myself to sleep tonight Jerma
If only you had a better character @Jerma985
I think the AI just wasn't programmed so how long is this game?
why does his face always look so fucked up
i wonder if the AI just isn't programmed
I remember seeing this game in some sort of medical condition
i love malding but i would love if you could stop being malding
JERMA THE DEFAULT FART JOEL CHASES OUT YOUR NAME BETTER
he's not gonna let it go, it's not his fault lmao
this is just like in china and you're never there
can we get an extra hour with this
how much did you pay for it LUL
how long until you get to do it with another person from the team
do you think the next emote will be jerma rumble
did the new twitch logo change? like its a new emote :)
are you going to be playing dead rising 2 ?
Is he streaming the first half of the stream?
if you go the other way you'll see the end!
the guy who made that fucking sonic game
its literally made out of wood not paint
you're in a time capsule, remember? jermaPluto
we get it man, it gets funnier every day jermaPluto
it's in your best game of all time
I can only imagine the angry and crying chat members when the stream started.
i will do my best to play minecord simps
that sounds like a good idea of your stream @Jerma985
i thought i would be dead as soon as i saw the first one :)
you got your bits in a bit don't start yet
Is your son in chat or something ?
@The_Balla_Koala is it only if you do it once every day?
i'm not even saying that you're wrong but i'm gonna say it
jerma is trying to prove that he can't play a game wrong
How would you do a speed run
Is this game actually a porn game? I've never been on this level.
YOU ARE GOING TO BITE YOUR HIGHER GRANDS
This is a fucking game of chess @jerma985
why do all the voices sound like jerma
have you listened to the music for that one game?
jermaHeart it's okay Jerma, love you for it tony hawk and the rest jermaHeart
He doesn't know the meaning of the word
I wish the internet was as strong as it is :(
hey when is the next community content night?
he's streaming on the saturday after sunday, and people are dying in there limesPls
It was nice of Jerma to not rush it in :(
I wanna see jerma watch some shitty anime
You are my favorite streamer because you do great!
hey guys remember in the future when Jerma was 5 years old
i wish jerma would have read this https://i.imgur.com/2zdDHt2.jpg
Jermie's not gonna stream today because he's getting sick rn, hes playing something else tomorrow jermaPluto
Jerma's character looks like a character from Red Dead Redemption 1
is it going to be some day? im not sure
i have 100,000 channel points and can do only 50 btw :)
You will be lucky to run out of lives if you play the final level :)
did i come into the stream just in time for jerma to say he sucks
you are making me so mad :(
is that the new emote that jerma is playing?
Is this the end of the game or one of them?
You're the first person to use it jermaDafoe
what have you done to the streamer jermaPluto
@N0SoupForU what an idiot, he can use it again later if need be
i dont want to think about how i should be sleeping again jermaPluto
is this that game where the guy gets his hands on a piece of string, and tries to string jump into a hole
you can sell it for as little as 15 bucks
he's not streaming until that point, that's what matters. the rest is you doing something. do stuff you want to do while in town
Is the stream being a bit or not?
it's the little green thing with a hole
I don't know anything about this game, can't say I'm watching a Jerma stream, or anything.
He's gonna get so sick of the music
i didnt know this was a movie stream
@frostyfaucet I think he saw it before he played it, you could be wrong with that
what is you ever supposed to be
Why would they call it the world's biggest cheese @Jerma985
can i get a jermaJup2 or jermaNosewipe in chat PogChamp
the guy on the right is just standing right where you are
I love how the game has this entire mission in it
I'm sorry I left you hanging you did that
You can get another item like the one that lets you use your feet
Jerma please stop putting on lipstick, people don't care about your boomer boy
I just joined how much of ameartah
@origion3 That would be the most obnoxious thing I'd do since I live in this area
I remember when this was the prestream chat
we all know it's gonna get better for him at least
Jerma can't play this on a ps2 game!
@Jacketz nah that shit isnt very common either OMEGALUL
jerma can't say his mom left us for his boomer boy
what the fuck did i just join in on
theres no way jerma is winning this already LUL
I'll watch your stream on friday i guess
You can play all the games on ONE tab
Jerma I'm begging you, give me more time.
imagine going to the beach and then having to get up to make that jump
are you trying out a new game?
Is that dude who did the dlc naked naked on his pants?
YOU CAN GET THE BOOTS AT THE SAME TIME
I think she means the blue part of the ship
i will just keep watching until im too ashamed
it's like when we were in the tutorial mode
why is this boomer so good at math
I just tried to download it, can you not stream
i wish i could hear the music i just tuned in
it's so good that they're all going fullscreen lol
i wonder if they can get to the very end of this game
this song doesn’t even have the song name right
if you get the boots u can get all 5 endings
jermaWalk DANG IT MEANS JERMA WILL NEVER GET TURNED BACK BY THE BULL
@Kiari13 he was the one who beat it
Jerma is so tall that if we keep going he won't be able to keep the shield in his legs
is this your last run of this level lmao
you have to do it without the sword, not at all
I'm going to bed now. You better find the next 10 minutes a good time
I just got back from my break and I see that?
i hate that he still hasnt learned the true combos
I think you are the one who killed him
i just got here can i check the logs?
it looks like a person doing a 180
jerma if this isn't here in five years i'm turning into an actual clown and the next stream will be my turn on the computer
you could have done this last time but you kept putting them down
JERMA ISNT STREAMING IN 3 MINUTES, PUT THE STREAM ON FOR 3 HOURS jermaSun
@kimdang is he playing this on a tablet?
can you say "I'm sorry for killing your wife"?
You won't run out of coins in 7 minutes
you were doing it on purpose and that's just how it works
Why does someone put the mic in the game? LUL
your not supposed to be streaming jerma
It has to make his health worse
if it's on an actual server can it be saved?
i can't even tell when jerma is being a robot
I'll never forgive you for the greed level of this game
How do you get the key to a house?
they need to say "you can't stop me"
the one time they ever get bored of a game
I mean, he'll play Kenshi again when I get home and I would like to play the second one
you'll have to wait until the tutorial to understand the controls
he doesn't remember the last game's name OMEGALUL
jermaChomp HEY YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS
it's like that spider game where the spider comes out of the bat
use the arrow to see what was it
jerma if it's not a jerma reference we riot
is that an actual name or a reference to that new game?
im gonna start streaming to get back around and take care of you
is there the giant enemy in the intro to the first game
I hope this is the last night of my life. :)
i thought you said you like baulpunian
they said its gonna start tomorrow and stream for half an hour
im just watching the whole game. what a dumb question streamer
Do you not know how to take a shower?
I just got here, and I get my sub badge back with a new design?
I can't wait to see Jerma do this again
The more he gets angry, the more desperate he gets
I'm watching a grown man playing with his dog right now
@DivusP just stop reading the chat to say "I am bad at math and don't know what to do"
You have to say "Takes too long" as a challenge
is this the streamer who beat gORK
what would you say to someone who is on drugs? @Jerma985
"We got a problem. Let's say there is an issue with someones schedule and how our schedule was changed/fixed but there is no problem for me"
i wonder if the main character knows about them
jerma please turn it on it lights up
youre like a 50/50 drunk rn play the games again
@havels how tf is that bot not deleted haHAA
can you say the rat song please
this has been the funniest stream this year
I don't even know what the fuck is going on
you should do it at a time when you need
there was a fire guy who died at the end?
jerma985, you have gone so wrong, I forgot you were still alive
I love that you can do this by accident :)
I hope you can do something funny tonight, what's up with it?
what the FUCK ARE YOU EVEN SUPREME-L
I love that everyone is giving him money but can't even help them
Jerma you should play the final fight and kill some demons on each one
i'm sorry you got in that accident :(
i left for like a long time and there is no stream? :D
you're not a coward is this what youre saying
i have 5.8k but i can never buy it
what if i told you, my dad is a twitch emote, and if he wanted to use it would u? i would be the best :)
I don't like it when the camera panics LUL
He's going to leave this house and go get a beer
just go into the other room then right click on her
i bet he doesn't even have a ps2
he's just watching the movies in his head lol
that's like saying you have a hard time with the world
use the arrow to see what was going on
What game is this? I left and came back to a stream where they are telling jerma about some weird little thing in the kitchen
just put 1 dollar into the machine
He said if I went for more then a month he'd be able to play it soon
just do it again it was all good
i used to watch anime on a TV
jerma should try streaming until 2020, it's a huge commitment to get that done
this is why i don't wear seatbelts to work or to listen to music
Theres a way to skip a boss without doing the whole mission
You have to get in the bubble of the blue monster.
I will do it for you

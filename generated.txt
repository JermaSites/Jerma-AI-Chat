@Jerma985 What is your opinion on the new Star Wars game?
I can't believe Jerma is still on this level
This game is fun but it's not a good stream game
@Jerma985 you don't have to be a mod, it's just that it's very hard to keep track of your progress, and it's really slow
do you get to the menu after a break
what if the whole stream is a vod
i just want to know how i got a sub
@Jerma985 so when is the stream with joel starting

its been like 3 months since the last stream
i just wanna see a picture of jerma
Jerma, you're going to need to leave now
@Jerma985 If you just keep playing I'll donate 50 bucks
It's gonna be the only game I've ever seen
jerma you can literally get the same level twice
@jerma985 why are you wearing a banana peel over your head?
I'll have to watch this stream to understand what's going on
this is like a mmo where you have to create a giant city with your own characters
YOU DON'T NEED A BATHROOM IF YOU'RE IN A COMA
@Jerma985 it's a sequel to the game
@Jerma985 is this the streamer who lost to pinwheel?

@Jerma985 i think you can get the coin from the girl you just met
@Jerma985 what did you think of the new Halo update?
@Jerma985 You're not even supposed to play it, you're playing the DLC.

jerma can you please get a haircut? my dog is crying
i'm not a fan of the new jerma but atleast i can make my own game
@Jerma985 can you do a backflip for the meme
@Jerma985 The mods are using it to tell them to stop.
i'm gonna be honest, this is pretty much a childrens game
@Jerma985 if you can read that, you can do it
You have to get it to 100% before the game even starts
jerma you gotta get the ball, then slide it
i cant believe jerma is a fucking psycho
This is like when you try to play with your grandma
@Jerma985 Theres a good one at the end of the game
If you want to play a game for a few hours, you can always look at the community content channel.
@Jerma985 you can do it i think you can
It's like a video game with a bunch of flashing lights
@Jerma985 do you have the green screen movie night coming up?

It's a shame there's only like 10 people here right now
it's not like you need to be an actor to do that
@Jerma985 you should probably play a better game
i dont think you can get that coin
You can get the coin from the girl
this is a really good stream LUL its so good
@Jerma985 you have to do it every 5 seconds
You can't get the coin, you can't get the coin
@Jerma985 Would you ever play the TF2 expansions?

@Jerma985 you can get a new set of teeth by looking at the new set of teeth
There's a hole in the wall in the basement
I'm glad I caught the stream, I'll miss it
you can do it by clicking the little circle in the top left
this is what happens when you don't have a nice enough bedtime
I can't believe Jerma's gonna get a VROOMER
why are you guys in such a hurry to make a "cool" game
theres a cave there it goes to when you die
This is a pretty good game, but I can't play it
@Jerma985 i know it's a lot, but youre making me hungry
I'm playing Terraria right now and this is what i come back to

@Jerma985 I think you need to hold the stick to move the chainsaw
I'm actually mad that I didn't catch the last stream

@Jerma985 you're going to get 5 hours of sleep
@Jerma985 You're a cool guy but you're a dumbass
@Jerma985 You are looking at the wrong way
I'm going to tell my dad you have a penis
the problem is that there are still some people who dont know what they're doing
that's how they used to do it @Jerma985
@Jerma985 Can you play this for the rest of the stream?
"Do you know what a JPEG is?"
how does this game have so many secrets
@Jerma985 you can get a really good ring at the inn
I wish I could see my favorite streamer jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Can you please play The Crystal Chronicles

@Jerma985 you have to kill the monster first
I can't believe he's just gonna die in his sleep

@Jerma985 is this a new sub sound? LUL

@Jerma985 Can you explain the joke
====================
I'm so glad I got to see this.

It's a lot easier to just make it smaller, and have a bigger diameter
@Jerma985 you need to be at least a tier 3 sub
theyre just gonna be the top 3 tbh
they are also going to be the first to have the coronavirus
jerma is this a challenge to your skill?

I'll be honest, I'm not sure. I've seen enough of this game, but I'm not sure
@Jerma985 you need to make your own character
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
This is like a game where you are the only one who gets the game
@Jerma985 you can skip the part where you get a better sword
It's just a joke, but it's a meme
@Jerma985 i love that you can only get to the sewers at this point
you have to grab the pistol and shoot the gun
"Did I ever tell you about my secret bath of slime"
I'm actually a little concerned that Jerma is gonna be late

If Jerma streams this on my birthday, I'm going to shit my pants.

jerma you can do it it's just a trick

@Jerma985 you can start the stream with a new song

you're gonna make a new account with a new username and your gonna stream for like 4 hours
you can hear his anger in his voice
@Jerma985 Do you have any idea how long it takes for a bingo card to be printed out
I can't believe they actually made a VR game

he does not have the energy to do this
it's a good game but not a good stream game
i think it's because you have to pay for your own subscription

This is like that scene from the 1998 movie American Psycho
it's a good thing you didn't play that game
how do i get back to the sub-only chat?

you can do that with the DLC :)
this is the most boomer thing i've ever seen
you could have just bought a new controller
@Jerma985 you could have put it in a bag and taken the controller to the store
I'm just gonna say it, this is a very funny stream, you're just not a real gamer
@Jerma985 you can use it to find the keys to the keybox
@Jerma985 Are you ever going to do the Simpsons hit and run again?

I have a confession to make, this game has a bad taste
@Jerma985 have you ever heard of a new york house?
@Jerma985 you can use it to find the keys to the keybox
@Jerma985 I don't know how you can say that but you're the only one that gets this

====================
@jerma985 remember to give him your strongest potions so he can kill zombies
theres no way youre gonna beat this game in 3 days
I wish there was more than one jerma stream
i want a world where jerma can't change his own oil
LUL I don't know what to do with myself
I mean you can't even call them "witches" in the normal way
He's gonna say he's a weeb and play a shrek game
this is like a very early version of the game
I'm sure he'll be able to catch up on the VOD
I just joined, what the fuck is happening
this is like a weird ass game for me
It's like a big ol' guitar with a big bass
@Jerma985 you look like a real deal person
I'm gonna go watch a Jerma985 stream tonight
@jerma985 there's a button to turn off the music, you can turn it back on after a few minutes
what if you get a gift sub?
why does he look like a human being
@Jerma985 You can upgrade it by going to the menu and clicking the options
it's the same thing as the first game
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME WITH A DIFFERENT ARMOR
I think the best way to get a refund is to not give the money back
@Jerma985 you can watch all the videos in the VOD
there's a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
you have to shoot the entire thing for the secret slime action
this is the best game ever made LUL
I didn't think there were that many actual people here
why are you moving like you're playing a porn game
i just got here what the fuck is this game
@Jerma985 don't forget to add the rats as a sub
you can use the otto voice for the next stream
@Jerma985 would you rather have a war criminal than a tyrant?
Jerma this is just the Bionicle campaign you played.
You need to go to the side menu
@Jerma985 you're gonna be a streamer for a while
why is there a picture of a fucking goblin on the wall?
theres a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
@Jerma985 please, do the jup, you'll be able to hear it
@Jerma985 you gotta look at the game, it's not a good game
@Jerma985 you can put it in your pocket and wear it with you
@Jerma985 The AI is doing a good job
you're not gonna get a good dragon jeremy
@Jerma985 It's not like you have any other ways to get stuff, it's just that they're very limited in their abilities
@Jerma985 just play the game, it's fine :)
@Jerma985 do you want to go to bed?
I just got here, is this the game that got him banned?
Jerma you can just put it in your mouth
I can't believe he's still in this game
@Jerma985 can you say "fuck" in a funny voice?
This is like the part where you play a shitty game
@Jerma985 play the game, it's fine, you just need to be more patient
@Jerma985 The second time you die in this game, you get a random item that gives you life.
@Jerma985 theres a secret slime action that's going to happen when he gets back
@Jerma985 just play the game with a keyboard
@Jerma985 use the elevator to get to the bottom of the pool
@Jerma985 have you ever considered playing the game maker game
"I'm not gonna do it" - Jerma 2019
@Jerma985 do a second run of this game
@Jerma985 just make sure you do your taxes first
He's gonna get so mad when he sees the credits
Jerma you can just click the menu button
@Jerma985 It's a monster, it's going to die out.
If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 You're doing a great job! A GREAT JOOB!
JERMA JUST GOT THE OLD JERMA CAMERA STREAMER PRERECORDED
How long has he been playing this game?
@Jerma985 you can see auras in the blue circle on the right
it's a good thing you're not a robot
@Jerma985 Please play this game without sound. I have been playing it for 2 hours and it's not fun.
What the fuck is wrong with this guy
jerma has a family of 9 kids
@Jerma985 go to the wardrobe to get boots
@Jerma
====================
I feel like this is a game where you play as a villager, and have to solve all the puzzles
this is just the start of the end
I'm glad I got to watch a stream without Jerma
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -160. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i think jerma might have some bad luck
What if we just got together and had a baby
I don't think you need to make a new character
I like the way he looks at chat
I was playing this for 6 hours yesterday and still have no clue what's going on
but you have to do the tutorial @Jerma985
i love how you can literally do anything and we're all just talking about random shit
@Jerma985 you have to write a couple of lines for the voices
@Jerma985 Do a stream where you just pretend to be a vod boy
I hope he plays both of them, he's one of the funniest people on twitch
i wouldnt be able to watch this stream without the owo emote
The wait for the fuck you table
jermaPluto just got here, what is this?
@Jerma985 you can use the other side of the fence to block the fence
I like the way Jerma looks at chat
@Jerma985 i was hoping you'd make a cameo in this game
this is the most megalomaniac thing ive ever heard
this is the most fucked up stream ive ever seen
@jerma985 I'm gonna be honest, this is the most fucked up stream of all time.
you can't even get to the end of the game without a boss
i love how the game prompts you to make a bunch of money
jermaWalk THE FUCKING FASTEST SHOOTERS IN THE WORLD jermaWalk

@Jerma985 It's a good game but it's not good for stream
@jerma985 you can use the other side of the fence to block it
@Jerma985 you can have a little bit of panda
oh yeah, there's a huge bunch of new games
@Jerma985 you can see the diamond in the top right
@Jerma985 how do you think the map works?
I hope he doesn't get so mad at himself
you have to go left on the beach
i think you can get a lot of money from that
I can't believe this streamer is going to have a heart attack
I hope this is the last time you play this game
@Jerma985 You can get a couple of tickets for it from the vending machine
this guy has the same hair as jerma
@Jerma985 are you ever gonna play the new fortnite?
the fact that you said "I am the streamer" is not helping the situation
What do you mean "Why does everyone hate this game?"
he's already here, he's not coming back jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can just use the other side of the fence
@Jerma985 you can use the other side of the fence to block it
what if jerma is just a figment of your imagination?
im gonna be honest, this is just weird
I'm going to go into a mental asylum, its gonna be hell
@Jerma985 use the other side of the fence to block it
i feel like this is a perfect game for this
you have to take the other side of the fence
@Jerma985 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THIS SUCKS
you have to take the other side of the fence
@Jerma985 can you put on a show for the whole family
What if they were both in the same room
@Jerma985 You can get a couple of tickets for it from the vending machine
Jerma is a big piece of shit. A true gamer.
I'm going to have a mental breakdown watching this
I'm going to get a drink now jermaPluto
I'm so glad Jerma and I are together
@jerma985 you can use the other side of the fence to block it
You can only get tickets for one thing
@Jerma985 can you do a stream where you just pretend to be a vod boy
the game is now on the front page of reddit
I'm so glad you're having fun Jerma! I'm so glad you're having fun!
I am a professional furry, I would have never known that.
@Jerma985 you have to put the other side of the fence
====================

jerma you have to say "i love you"
@Jerma985 you got the "bad joke" hat now
@Jerma985 you can just make a new character with a new hero

Why is he wearing a tank top that's for a tank top?

i don't even know what he's talking about
jermaPluto this is why we don't have jerma awards
@Jerma985 you can find an apple in the store
why did he put the lipstick on his face?
@Jerma985 If you're not playing this game for the carnival stream, you're not a real gamer
@Jerma985 you can actually buy a car with the game
why did he read that one guy's name in the title
You can't say you're not a gamer
What if we're all the same person :)
why is this the guy that ate a shoe on stream
This game is so fun. It's like a 5/10.
@Jerma985 when are you gonna play Mother 3?
I'm starting to think that this game is a ripoff of the third world
You're like a kid who gets your own bath water

@Jerma985 you know you could make it faster if you were to throw the balls in the air
I bet this guy was never a kid
@Jerma985 You need to use the light to go faster
@Jerma985 you have to be close enough to shoot it
@Jerma985 this game is like a rehash of Bloodborne
@Jerma985 so you can do that in every game

Just gonna say I love watching you stream this game.
I think you got it wrong, you didn't pay attention

I've never seen someone so stuck in a room
I hate when I see that message OMEGALUL
I'm just here to help Jerma get his bearings, and I'm disappointed that he's not doing his job.

@Jerma985 Your mic is on, the controller is off

you have to do it for the whole stream
@Jerma985 Play the B.I.G OST or I will scream
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I'm a fucking millennial and I'm not even a millennial
you can do it. we believe in you :)
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
@Jerma985 you should do a "me doin it" challenge
@Jerma985 You can buy the "A-10" in the center of the ship
I'm going to go watch the VOD. I love you all
@Jerma985 i found the stream and it's just you talking
HE IS GOING TO GET A THIRD FIST HEAD
I feel like a toddler trying to remember a song
@Jerma985 I think you have to go back to the same spot
@Jerma985 You have to make the house a real house now
@Jerma985 would you rather have a pogchamp or a pee break
he didnt do it, he just did it
@Jerma985 I will literally beat you up if you dont play the game.
@Jerma985 you need to make a new character
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
@Jerma985 How many points do you have?
@Jerma985 I don't think you're going to beat this game, you can beat this game
@Jerma985 there's a shortcut to the right, it's on the left
@Jerma985 i'm not even going to tell you this
I hope you guys remember when he said he'd do the fortnite streams
jerma can you turn on facecam so i can tell you how i feel
@Jerma985 can you play doom eternal with the music turned up
I just came here to say thanks and this is the best stream ive ever watched
jerma's gonna be stuck in the factory for the next 3 hours
Jerma I'm begging you to play the OST
This is why you don't play the game
why is this game so fucking hard LUL
@Jerma985 You've been streaming for like 8 hours and it's already almost 2 AM
i hate that game too but it's not that bad
@Jerma985 This is the worst thing you've ever done
@Jerma985 I'm a fan of your youtube channel and have watched you since you were like 12 years old, this is great
the only reason i can think of a single reason that jerma is a better streamer than joel is because he's actually a better streamer
i had a dream where jerma said he was gonna stream tonight
I'm a child but I'm too young to vote
@Jerma985 this is a bit late but can you please play the music
I wish he was playing Doom Eternal again :(
I got a gift sub today. I'm so glad
@Jerma985 It's not a bootleg if you know what I mean
@Jerma985 The only time I see the Wii is on the Wii
====================
 "How to make an actual copy pasta" video.
oh god he's gonna do that, he's gonna do that
i just got here what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 You can't just ignore the trash and say its good
I love how Jerma just gets his chat to be in emote only mode
I think the next time you stream, it'll be a green screen stream
I'd rather watch you get put on a movie
@Jerma985 you should get a gaming chair that has a barcode reader in it
we have to do the same thing every time
i hope he streams it again so we can all laugh
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play this game again?
i would have never guessed it was a game about a child
if you didn't know that, you'd know it was a thing
The only thing I want from a burger king is for them to tear me down
i'm just glad he's not playing anything else
@jerma985 would you say theres a single thing you've done wrong?
If you go back to the sewer you get the slime dragon
@Jerma985 theres a secret room in the second floor
do you know how to do the mirror dance?
i bet jerma has a huge collection of drugs
how long has he been playing this game?
i dont think i can wait to see what happens
Can you add a few more emotes please?
@Jerma985 it's actually a place to get drunk
this is the equivalent of a tom and jerry episode
@Jerma985 You can't keep doing the same thing over and over
what about the time you ate a whole sleeve of oreos and threw up in your mother's bed
@Jerma985 that's like my face, it's just a huge eyeball
@Jerma985 I'll get you a drink and a sandwich, thanks :)
I want to see you play the game
I think you need to watch the video
I just got here what is going on
why is it always the person that doesnt die
@Jerma985 its a bot and you have to play it
i just got here, what the fuck is going on
you should get the boots, they are really good
I just got here what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 you can actually use the "show us" button to make a group of friends
I want to see you play this game
I feel bad for Jerma, he is the only streamer who doesn't have a camera
If you think that's a lie, try to prove it by being in a human costume
I have a soft spot for Jerma jermaHeart
i just joined and i see this is jerma985
@Jerma985 when are you gonna stream return of the king?
I can't believe you were such a good boy
@Jerma985 You should get some mods to do this for you
@Jerma985 i just got here is this the new kingston game?
@Jerma985 You can probably get it at a local store
jerma i know youre a liar but what if you just dont know
they're just going to be called the frogmen
this is how jerma gets his youtube channel views
@Jerma985 It's a shame that you can't do anything on stream because you're just a big, fat loser who doesn't have a single shred of a life.
@Jerma985 you can do it if you're willing to play it
I like how Jerma just doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
@Jerma985 please make a rat emote it's very cute
he thinks he can fight the dragon in a game
@Jerma985 make a new emote with the same name and title :)
This is just like that one episode of Spongebob where they go to the hospital and they are a moron
i'm not sure if he knows or not
You need to be a super human to get the boots
jermaWalk GET THIS GAME OUT OF MY VIEW WHAT I WANT IS NANCY DREW jermaWalk

I'm gonna go watch the vod, get some sleep, see you guys in a couple hours.
SOMEONE TYPE IN THE CUSTOM WHILE YOU'RE GONNA BEAT IT
i like to imagine he's just going to be playing as a bunch of bots and we'll just be all jermas
when he turns on the face cam he looks like he's been wearing a wig for the past 2 hours

@Jerma985 try to keep it in mind when you play
@jerma985 how do you have your facecam on

jermaChomp ðŸ“£ I'M A SLAVE I'LL TAKE YOUR DAMN HAT

We will get you if you keep playing this
@Jerma985 i would like to buy you a pack of gum

You're not a real gamer if you don't have a gamer license
@Jerma985 YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY
@Jerma985 You need to be able to walk around
Jerma is going to play the NGU idle game again

I'm really glad you're not a streamer :)

Is this the streamer who ate his nose on stream?
I just got here, what is he talking about?
@Jerma985 can you do the "If you're hot" voice?
@Jerma985 YOU WERE A GOOD BOY, GIVE US A NEW ONE
this is gonna be the most epic stream
jerma you're not gonna make it to the top
I think that's why you had to do it, you have to
The last time you played this game was when you were like 8 years old
@Jerma985 you can get the good ending in the menu if you have the game on
@Jerma985 you can get a high score on the top right if you keep a high score
Jerma

jermaPluto_HF jermaPluto_HF jermaHeart jermaHeart_HF jermaHeart_HF jermaPluto_HF jermaHeart_HF
@Jerma985 you can use the other eye to see the sun and planets
I wish I had a sub :(
I can't believe Jerma won't play this game because he doesn't have the memory to play it
I'm getting flashbacks to the time I saw Jerma's old twitch chat room and immediately had a bad day
i'll be honest, i'd rather eat my own ass than watch this game
@Jerma985 this game is like a 90s teen tit

@Jerma985 did you know that you can buy an entire house for 1.5k?

I heard the same thing when I was a kid, I'm sure.
I have to go to bed now, goodnight everyone jermaHeart

i think you can go to a doctor

@Jerma985 You can use the water gun to make a fish.
@Jerma985 you have to do the tutorial and then watch it

Jerma is doing the "just dance for me" bit again
he doesnt know what a coaster is
i know a girl who works at a hospital and she is a nurse
chat stop being so mean to jerma, he's only been streaming for like 5 minutes
i remember when jerma used to stream
@Jerma985 You have to actually see it, it's a cheat to play without it
@Jerma985 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE
@Jerma985 what if you get hit by a car
@Jerma985 you have to turn off the music
you should stop doing the bit where you have to pee
What the fuck is happening, i just got here
@Jerma985 I heard a rumor that the game was gonna be the last one
Is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?
Why do you have a rat in your house?
Jerma is just trying to be cool and to be hip
@Jerma985 Did you not see the new character in the remake?
hey, just got here, why is jerma so compact
@Jerma985 you need to keep running, it's not gonna be the same
you have to take the gate off the map
Jerma you can't do this, this is too much effort
why did he just walk into the bear trap
you're gonna die in the first hour
You can't just tell people to fuck off if they're going to go with the flow
S T R A L L I N G
what the fuck does that even mean LUL
just have the player character with a gun fight
The only way to win is not to play
@Jerma985 You can't just cut a guy's head off, you need to cut the head
Oh god, I can't believe I'm listening to this music
I wish Jerma would play more shitty anime games
I wish Jerma would show us his goth feet
@Jerma985 You could have just put a bunch of stuff on the floor, and just let the door be the door
@jerma985 get out of here, you're making me hungry
why do i hear the music in the background?
i mean theres no point in being bad at this
what is this "chat" shit? is it really a game?
@Jerma985 you can check the list of saved games
@Jerma985 did you know that the original "Jerma" was an acronym for the Jerma985 Twitch account?
this is the most frustrating thing ive ever seen
@Jerma985 you know its gonna be a good stream
@Jerma985 It's a 3d model of the rat
why are there so many people in a row?
There was a knockoff version of the game
@Jerma985 I don't have any money, can you make a second Jerma985?
he is gonna be late for work jermaPluto
@Jerma985 this is the worst joke of 2020
@Jerma985 its the one with the headless guy
@Jerma985 you have to pay for the carnival stream
you need to be able to run in this game
i cant believe jerma is playing a fucking carnival game
@Jerma985 please for the love of god play viscera cleanup detail
imagine paying for a twitch stream with a bunch of money
@Jerma985 You can switch between them with the dpad
I hope you get to the end of the game
@Jerma985 It's the "don't do that" bit, Jerma
@Jerma985 if you die in the game you die in real life
this game is just a ripoff of the dark knight xd
he's not going to make it back up
@Jerma985 why would you be playing this if you didn't want to play it
I like how he's playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 this is a trainwreck, not gonna lie
you cant just eat your own shit tomatoBWL
you can just run into the wall to get a shield
@Jerma985 You have to tell him to use the grappling hook
@Jerma985 you can stack it and pull it out
I like the sound of your voice when you say it
@Jerma985 can you tell me how to do this?
jermaOld back in my day we did it
@Jerma985 Just joined the stream, what's going on?
@Jerma985 you gotta get the boots for the secret boss

====================
@Jerma985 This is a really good bit of lore
@Jerma985 why are you wearing a diaper on stream?
jerma is just making up excuses to not stream today
you need to find the one person in the audience that actually likes your video
how many channel points for a picture of your feet
i mean, you could just do it in the shower
@Jerma985 If you could do a better job at this game, what would it be?
i love how the vod is still muted
@Jerma985 I think you need to change your appearance to match your character
@Jerma985 you look like the guy from GTA V
this game was made by a bad company
i don't know what to think about this
@Jerma985 stop playing with the weapon on the ground
@Jerma985 You have a 90's thing going on
@Jerma985 it's not an ad, it's a platform
@Jerma985 you can put a bunch of stuff into the middle of the floor
if you get 3 more lives you can get the secret ending
why does the old man have a face?
@Jerma985 I have seen the funko pop for like a year and I'm still shocked
I'm pretty sure the secret ending is just a cheat
that's a really cool look in your eyes
do you have to go to the store to buy stuff?
why are there two naked women in a bath?
why is this game a little too scary
you need to go to the store to buy stuff
@Jerma985 you're only supposed to get one of those
I bet he'll be back to this in 3 years
he's gonna die of a heart attack jermaPluto
I think it's gonna be a 2 day stream
i have a feeling he won't be able to beat it in time
@Jerma985 jerma please play this for the rest of the stream, I'm begging you.
The game just doesn't want to admit it is funny
This is the worst stream of 2020 LUL
youre supposed to be in a bed with a bunch of others
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, this game looks pretty good
@Jerma985 you could do a whole stream where you just walk around naked in public
@Jerma985 you can do this in the other game
@Jerma985 you can do it in the other game too
oh i remember that i was in the chat
@Jerma985 you have to fight the boss to get the secret ending
@Jerma985 you can find more heroes in the dungeon

"Hey, this is the best game ever made. Great stuff"
I want to go back to the dark souls stream
@Jerma985 The AI is a little slow compared to the first game, but it's still better
@Jerma985 You need to build a fence around the entire place, it'll make it easier
so i just came back and he's still here
This game is actually pretty fun. This is a great game.
you have to be in the middle of a big line
you're the only one who can do this
@Jerma985 it's not really a stream game, it's a video game
You can do it Jerma! You can do it!

@Jerma985 can you please do the tutorial again?
@Jerma985 you need to do a little more creative with the hand
He's gonna get a double d because he can't beat the first level
This is how Jerma makes his money off of streaming.
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game? you know you're bad at it.
@Jerma985 do you have a pulse? do you feel something?
@Jerma985 is this what you do in your free time?

i just got here, why is he using the bathroom?
this game is so weird but so good
LUL you can do it if you try
@Jerma985 you can put a fence around the entire place to make it easier
This is what happens when you don't play the game.
This is like the most boring thing in the world
it's a fucking mess, you can't get over it
I want to go back to the dark souls stream :(
@Jerma985 you should do a community night where you're all here, sing the rats song
I hate when you get a random alien
@Jerma985 you need to stop being mad because you are a moron
this is just the m&ms intro song LUL
I've been a fan of the Halo series since the very beginning

@Jerma985 jerma you can get the dragon from the secret room in the castle
@Jerma985 What if you were to eat a frog and it would be a big rat

@Jerma985 You're just playing a video game, you know that right?

@Jerma985 If you want to know the truth, just ask the lady in the diner.
You have to get the 2nd one first
@jerma985 If you don't play this game I'll actually die
@Jerma985 just hold left trigger and move it with the X to dodge
This is the most generic game I have ever seen
the only way to win is not to play
@Jerma985 It's like a baby rabbit with a shiny tail
is this the streamer that beat the CUBE ON STREAM?
@Jerma985 why do you have so many holes in your house

@Jerma985 You should play a game with chat. Chat is boring to watch
Why do you look like a homeless person

@jerma985 why are you so out of place
jermaOld I remember when Jerma used to stream
i was just watching your stream and I'm confused by this
I'm too lazy to get to the stream
@Jerma985 this is the worst game you've ever played
@Jerma985 you should play the actual game it's just great
@Jerma985 I thought you said you were gonna play Ace Attorney tomorrow
"I'm just gonna go back to my house"
I think this game is gonna be a fucking disaster

@Jerma985 just put a bunch of stuff on the floor to make it seem more impressive
@Jerma985 You should play Chrono Trigger OST https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7U2hF-X4U

I am so sad I missed the stream jermaPluto
I don't think this game is for you
this is the best game in the game
@Jerma985 you can't just make the game your own, you'll get sued for this shit
@Jerma985 hey, what's your opinion of black and white 2
@Jerma985 You can just get it for free on Steam
you can tell it's not a joke when it's "so boring"
I'm glad Jerma didn't have to listen to the voices
he can't even say it on stream anymore
@Jerma985 how many times have you done this
@Jerma985 youre gonna need to do the first level
He has a bag of chips in his backpack

Why are you giving away your personal information
@Jerma985 you can always send me the link in chat
how did you manage to make that sound
@Jerma985 You're in a coma, please wake up
i think you have to use the elevator to get up
the only way to win is not to play
"im not gonna lie, im gonna be so pissed if i dont get the gold coin"
jerma how much do you wanna bet that you won't?
that's what happens when you put all your eggs on the right side
i don't know how to tell what's jerma talking about
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE OTHER WOMAN
you can't play the game for more than 2 hours
I can't believe Jerma was born with a bionic arm, that's why he's not in the next rumble
I just want to see the guy who beat dark souls on stream
jerma is mad and he's talking about his poop
you should be banned from every game ever
It's time for you to watch
====================
I've been subbed to Jerma for like 6 months. I'm so happy to be in his stream
@Jerma985 try to keep it to yourself and keep the joke

@Jerma985 Jerma, I'm trying to say thanks for the years of entertainment, but I'm also really upset because I didn't get to catch the end of the stream.
@Jerma985 you can go into the sewer level with the shovel
@Jerma985 you have to make the town look like an actual town
@Jerma985 I think it's because you haven't been paying attention to the game
you're a fucking sociopath and you're going to jail
@Jerma985 you can't actually die to pinwheel, it's a glitch
@Jerma985 you can use the ladder to walk on it
@Jerma985 is it because you don't know how to use the axe?

you can do it! you're the only one who can!
@Jerma985 you have to do it with the same character
I'm a man of my word, you can do anything with me
if you're going to make it on your own, you should do it with a different character
@Jerma985 You know this is a real game right?
@Jerma985 the game doesn't have a sound, it just has a timer
theyre just in the game to be fair
if you're not happy with a game why are you playing it
@Jerma985 the game will be worth the money
@Jerma985 is this the guy who beat the game on stream?
you know what you dont need to do
This is the best part of the game
@Jerma985 what if you
====================

@Jerma985 I have the same problem, it's a race car problem
I cant believe the voice actor for a manlet was a substitute teacher
@Jerma985 you are an hour early, time to leave
@Jerma985 just try to find a town with an entrance to it
he's gonna spend the whole stream on this
if you die in the game you die for real
@Jerma985 You have to turn the music down to 0%
jermaWalk i wish i could do the same
@Jerma985 you are making me want to watch this
I love that they just make up a bunch of numbers
@Jerma985 The first time I heard that you had a life and you were just a robot.
@Jerma985 You can play as the other characters, they're just not as good
i'm out of the loop on the jerma rumble
@Jerma985 You could have used the free upgrade that lets you summon skeletons
@Jerma985 If you don't beat this game I'm gonna fucking puke
@Jerma985 you dont need to be in the game
i love how the vod is just the same stream
why does jerma look like he has a gamer neck
this is like a fever dream but jerma is actually a god
I want to see him get his ass kicked
@Jerma985 can you do a normal voice with the voice changer?
jerma you need to have a walkthrough of this game
He's just gonna say "OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO SMART!"
you can't die if you don't die in the game
@Jerma985 you have to buy the blueprints, theyre free
@Jerma985 i am going to say the n word
I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kinda excited for this
I don't think the devs knew what was happening
I have a feeling you don't want to watch this but I don't think you'd like it.
@Jerma985 you can make an even bigger house
@Jerma985 when is the next green screen stream?
@Jerma985 I think you should do a bit where you get a lot of new friends, like with Mr. Bean
jerma can you play another game please i need to watch this one
there's a reason we don't have music - it's not like we have anything else
i was gonna say you're a good person but i got the wrong impression
you're doing great Jerma, keep it up and keep it up
this is like the greatest speedrun of all time
i'm going to fucking scream at the screen
@Jerma985 I bet you could beat it with the sun
@Jerma985 you can do it in real life
oh god i have a fake ipad in my room
i would love to see him play mario kart
@Jerma985 I've been here for 2 hours, you're still here?
@Jerma985 so are you doing another 24 hours stream

@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T GET UP THERE, YOU'RE IN A COMBINE

I'm here for the chat not the stream
this game is just like, a banger
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure they were supposed to make the movie for this game
I can't believe Jerma got the coronavirus. He's like 40% through and doesn't have much time left
@Jerma985 what if they're all just saying a swear word
I'm not sure why, but I have no clue
this is what happens when you don't do the tutorial
theres a huge difference between the two streams
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
You need to find the secret room in the safe room
@Jerma985 just do a poll so people can pick

@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO BE AT LEAST 50% TO BE BANNED
jerma this is like the only time i have ever seen you play this game
I know the reason why Jerma doesn't like it so much is because he doesn't have the same personality as the other guy, but I know it's because he doesn't have the same sense of direction.

why does the pizza in the top left look like a pizza
@Jerma985 you can only eat it at the buffet
@Jerma985 I'm starting to think the game might have been rigged from the start
jerma you should make a website called "jermaEarth" that tracks the amount of time that is left in the earth
i dont want to see the inside of a human
@jerma985 it's like a sex thing, don't be afraid to take it
he's going to die to a car
@Jerma985 when you are not streaming, I'm gonna be so fucking sad
@jerma985 you have to click the red button
Jerma is a very smart man, he knows how to play this game
If you die you'll never get the boots
@Jerma985 The game is a rip off of this game
I can't believe he actually did the stream
can we get a petition for Jerma to play a game called "Mystery Game"
@Jerma985 you can use the menu button to switch between the different sounds
@Jerma985 you should get a better pc for this game
@Jerma985 if you die to pinwheel, you die in real life
@Jerma985 did you know that there's a fucking pinwheel
@Jerma985 Are you going to finish Sam and Max season 3?

====================
This is the most you can do it

Jerma do you really think you can do this?
I can't believe Jerma is actually streaming right now
@Jerma985 You can change the difficulty in the options
@Jerma985 i'm pretty sure this is the only way
@Jerma985 would you consider making a tf2 clone?
I think we should get a jermaVenus emote
you need to get a more powerful axe
This is like the Dead Space 2 intro
@Jerma985 you should play this game again, it's got a really good story and you can enjoy it
JERMA YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE MOST LEVEL OF YOUR CLASS
@Jerma985 if you're looking for a job, try some real estate
@Jerma985 I've seen you in a couple of times

@Jerma985 you need to go to the very beginning
you don't have to press the buttons to do things
@Jerma985 theres a big hole in the wall
I just got here and this looks like a movie
It's a shame the graphics were too much
@Jerma985 you were supposed to eat the shoe
this is the most fucked up thing ive ever seen
@Jerma985 This is the only one that works
@Jerma985 That's not how it works, you have to jump when you get hit.

@Jerma985 Have you ever seen a girl in your dreams?
I dont think it was in the original game
@Jerma985 how many quarters does it take to beat this?
@Jerma985 what do you think of the new sonic movie?
@Jerma985 if you get shot once, you get shot twice
@Jerma985 I'm surprised you didn't play the rat level, it's a boss
i miss when jerma wouldnt be in chat jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Make sure to keep the camera on at all times

I just realized the thumbnail is of Jerma playing with the controller
@Jerma985 YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULDN'T GO TO THE SAME BAR
@Jerma985 You need to do the Talk to Transformer stuff, he said it's "very important"
@Jerma985 It's not a video game, it's a really good game
@Jerma985 please play "The Thing" I want to see how you do
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

You're gonna get some real brain damage from this game
@Jerma985 i think you should try the new one, it's a lot more interesting
@Jerma985 that's a really good idea, don't forget about the new baby

@Jerma985 when you get to the final room, it'll show you your stats
@Jerma985 Have you seen the new Scooby Doo movie?
@Jerma985 The bar has a little light in it, that light helps you see where you are
"i want to see a dead body" -jerma

you can go to the far left and go to the other town
I think it's a reference to the mr x
that's the only way to win you need to be able to put your head in the air
You could have just told them to not talk to you
@Jerma985 If you did that you would have won
@Jerma985 do you have the funny voice clip
this is a big way of getting money
what's the point of this if you don't know what's going on
Just admit you're not enjoying it enough to not say it
jerma you just got 5 stars in the dictionary
is this the streamer that beat jump king?
did you get that $60,000 to play a game called Mario Tennis
the music is making it sound like you are in a room

@Jerma985 i think this is the best game in the series
I can't wait for the end of the stream
i was about to type that but forgot
@Jerma985 you gotta go back to the main menu and look at options
how does it feel to be a fortnite streamer?
@Jerma985 This is like the Dark Souls of video games
can you go back to the menu and look at options?
I love that the music is just a bunch of beats
He's gonna start the stream with some bad food

@Jerma985 hey jerma can you pause the game i gotta go pee
It's like they got rid of the old style in the game
jerma has to finish the first game LUL
i'm still waiting for the "Jerma has a crush on my dog" bit
He's going to die of old age by the time he's 85
you're not even halfway done, just beat the game
@Jerma985 that's a really good joke, but it's not going to be funny
I'm glad that you're doing a good job. I feel so betrayed.
@Jerma985 I think you're just not a real gamer.
@Jerma985 what if you just do a whole playthrough of the game and you're bad at it
you just made a kid cry and throw the football
@Jerma985 you can go to the planet after you kill the ape
I think Jerma will have a mental breakdown in 5 minutes
"i'm so sorry, I can't get to this part"
if you want to have fun with the game you need to play with your friends
@Jerma985 just look at the green screen video
this is the best stream of the year
imagine being in a place with high winds and a 20% mortality rate
If you die in the game you die in real life
This guy's a god gamer, you should know this
he is gonna die in the end
i feel like im having a fever dream
that was a nice bit of stream :)
I know, he said he was gonna play it today

you got that guy in your pocket jerma
jerma has been live for a few hours
is this the streamer that was supposed to be live?
I just got here and I'm already confused
@Jerma985 i think you need to turn down the difficulty
I don't think this is a good idea
Jerma is really fucking with the stream right now
i dont even remember what this game was
i just got here what the fuck is happening
I'm going to have to go to sleep now
I'm going to sleep, Jerma, thanks for the stream
i hope jerma streams another game again this week
you know i'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
if you want to see a god just ask her
he's going to die in the first hour
I thought this was supposed to be a relaxing stream
@Jerma985 dont tell him about the secret ending
can you please get the fuck out of the way
they were trying to teach the lessons, but the teacher was a pervert
I'm actually pretty sure he's gonna get a lil bored
I'm going to bed, Jerma, goodnight everyone <3
@Jerma985 you know what they say about a good streamer?
i've never played a video game in my life

@Jerma985 you have to do a full inventory on the last mission
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma I have to go to work, can you pause the game?

I'm surprised you didn't get a sub from the carnival stream
@Jerma985 you have to take the ring to the tomb

@Jerma985 you can do a face reveal and then you can do a face reveal
Why does the narrator sound like a momma voice

HEY GUYS WELCOME TO JERMA985'S STREAM, HE'S GOT A BOOGER
@Jerma985 I have a personal opinion on the current state of the stream

SourPls YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS SONG

@Jerma985 you're a good streamer and you've helped me through some rough times
@Jerma985 I'm on my phone and it's not working, you're getting an error.

You're going to have to play a different game
@Jerma985 you can make a single weapon in another room
JERMA, JUST TURN OFF THE GAME AND PLAY THE GAME
you can just look up the guide for the tutorial
i want to be in the front row but i have no idea what to do
I don't know what any of this means
@Jerma985 can you do the official countdown from yesterday?
The only thing that could happen is that you'd be watching a live commentary of a live stream

that was a lot of effort for the same sound mechanic as that boss
@Jerma985 Can you explain the meaning of life
@Jerma985 did you hear the news that one of the snipers got shot in the head?
I'm really surprised Jerma hasnt gone to jail yet
i feel like this is just jerma doing a voice for the whole game
@Jerma985 you can have it auto kill after the last one
he's going to be here for like 3 hours
@Jerma985 what about a train track in the garage
@Jerma985 if you're going to play another game, play Nancy Drew instead
I'll be back in 30 minutes, guys. :)
Just jump off the edge of the cliff
@Jerma985 i dont think the game knows youre on the edge of it
I'm gonna go to sleep, wake up, and you're still here
you can't get a license for this, you have to prove you own a copy of the game
i feel like im in the middle of a symphony
@Jerma985 You just got out of your home prison

I'm in the mood for a nice relaxing game
@Jerma985 if you leave this level I'll go to bed
You should play the game from the start

You gotta put some effort into your sentences
This is the best thing to come out of this stream
Jerma is gonna be so mad when he sees this
i heard jerma is going to be in a jerma rumble
it's not as if theres a lot of people here, they're all just here

I would rather watch a 3 year old streamer than this
@Jerma985 hey just wanted to let you know that I am actually really enjoying the stream so far. Really really really enjoyed the game. :)

There are a ton of games that are more about farming than just killing them

@jerma985 why do you have to be so upset at a game being played?
@Jerma985 You can't just say "I'm so sorry" and not play the game
@Jerma985 do you think you'll ever play that other game called Team Fortress 2?
I can't believe jerma is gonna lose in a Rumble

he has to be in the other room
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA WAKE UP
He's gonna do it and then be done
he's gonna eat a raw egg and spill it all over his keyboard
@Jerma985 how many times has that person been to a mcdonalds?
@Jerma985 why are you still streaming when we told you to stop
This is why Jerma is so popular. He is a serial killer.
@Jerma985 you can do it again later when you get the boots

I love how Jerma is using his psuedo-mental abilities to get to the top of the mountain
JERMA YOURE GOING TO DIE IN THE BATHROOM

@Jerma985 you're the only streamer I watch who has never had a seizure
@Jerma985 you gotta find the thing and make it stand still
@Jerma985 It's like you've never played a video game before
i feel bad for this guy because he can't stand it
@Jerma985 You're gonna get some fucking crack at the end
@Jerma985 what if you're already in the wrong place
He got stuck in the tutorial LUL

I'm gonna be honest, I'm really excited for this stream.

@Jerma985 my brother had a case of the pimple in his chest and he was actually allergic to it
I'm gonna be honest, I'm really excited for this stream.
I'm not even sure what's happening in this game, I'm just here for the chat
@Jerma985 why are you wearing a backpack on?
i need to go to bed, can you pause the stream?
@Jerma985 You said "I don't know how to play this" the other day

@Jerma985 you can use the rocket nozzle to climb the tower
@Jerma985 you can just run to the side of it

Chat has Bashed 22 Seagulls, use !bash to help
jerma has been live for channel is not live
@Jerma985 your brain is so small you need a magnifying glass

@Jerma985 Just because you're not a psycho doesn't mean you aren't a cool person
@Jerma985 I'm still waiting for a special guest to get on stage.

@Jerma985 you can just ask her to make a new one
"I dont want to go to bed"
I wish they made a VR game like this.
@Jerma985 The game awards are still in February
you dont need to move your mouse when you're on the ground
@Jerma985 the way the game is said "WHERE"
You know you can just go out to eat at a restaurant and eat an entire lasagna at once, right?
jermaOld Jerma is the first person I've ever seen
hey guys im new here is jerma ok

@Jerma985 you can play the game with the guide book and keyboard
if you don't do it you're a fucking child
@Jerma985 you are a top streamer, get it right
I would've had to go to bed right now
This is the hardest boss in the game, Jerma
i want to go to bed but i don't want to miss the stream
this is like the half life game from the early 2000s
you got it right, you can do it
@Jerma985 You can go to a casino and gamble it all away
@Jerma985 You can't get a good PS1 controller for this
you just wanna be the one guy
@Jerma985 the other guy is literally the main character
I love that the theme for the game is the theme of my nightmares
@Jerma985 you have to get the golden boots
You're gonna get sick of it when you go back to the main menu

@Jerma985 It's a hard game, but the bosses are fun
why does this game have a 0 on the joke score
@Jerma985 you should be able to go to the bathroom and get a glass of milk
I'm gonna say it, Jerma's the best streamer ever, and he's gonna have a blast
The stream is going to be so boring LUL
@Jerma985 you have to do it to the whole screen
@Jerma985 youre doing a great job and a great job

@Jerma985 you can change the date in the options
@Jerma985 jerma can you do a voice command
@Jerma985 you're really making it sound like you're not even a real gamer
@Jerma985 if you get in the blackhole, it's going to hurt you
I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean with a fishing boat and no fish
why is he playing this game in the middle of the desert
JERMA I WANT TO GET OFF MR WOODS WILD RIDE

@jerma985 I just got here what the fuck is happening

@Jerma985 you can make a paperclip store in the yard
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THIS ONE
@Jerma985 I can't believe you just admitted to eating ass
@Jerma985 you got some good vibes dude, just not as good as the other two
This is the most genuine Jerma is having
@Jerma985 hey can you explain the fuckface movie please?
i'm sorry jerma i have to leave now
@Jerma985 you can make a paperclip store in the yard
@Jerma985 It's because you got trapped in the middle of the water
jerma you need to stop streaming it's time to relax
I like how Jerma985 is still playing this game
@Jerma985 it's a really good game, but it's not a good stream game
@Jerma985 can you explain the fuckface movie please
@Jerma985 Just wait for the wind to kill you
@Jerma985 You can get a free copy of the game with that one
@Jerma985 can you please say pee pee poo poo
@Jerma985 i think you have to find the disc
I can't believe Jerma thinks this is real
@Jerma985 That is the voice actor for the character
it's like a cave with a bunch of skeletons
i feel like im in a fever dream
@Jerma985 you can make a paperclip store in the yard
@Jerma985 you can make a paperclip store in the yard
@Jerma985 are you gonna play this game for the entirety of the next week?
theres a lot of stuff on youtube that you can do

@Jerma985 theres a secret in the closet that you can use to unlock the secret door
he's gonna get a lotta people killed
@Jerma985 you can make a paperclip store in the yard
i'm not paying attention to this game, what is going on
you guys are just pretending to be bad
i would get so many e3 presentations this year
@Jerma985 what do you think of the new Blizzard character?
why do you keep talking about getting rid of all the wink emotes
if i were to donate $10 would you pay it back?
I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean with a fishing boat and no fish.
jerma you need to stop playing this game
what the fuck does this even mean
Jerma just call the stream and tell us to be quiet
@Jerma985 You can't just sell your soul to them
====================
@Jerma985 it's like a small phone, you can call it
You should put it on a table and then let it sit for 20 minutes
@Jerma985 What are you doing today with your schedule?
You can hear the anger in his voice
@Jerma985 that's what you get for not getting the boots
We are just watching the stream in the bathroom
@Jerma985 You can get a lot of good items for a lot of money
@Jerma985 you can turn off the radio for a while
I'm so glad I was able to catch one of these streams
@Jerma985 You're not gonna get past the first level, you're gonna get to the last level first
@Jerma985 It's been a long time since I've been here
jerma, if you don't do this tomorrow I'm gonna tell my mom
@Jerma985 it's because you didn't get the boots
This is the most casual thing I've ever seen
@Jerma985 Do you have any plans for the Halloween stream?
@Jerma985 you need to remember you can always tell when a stream is happening
you have to do the right thing and cancel it
Jerma please play this game with a controller it's so good
@Jerma985 I'm so glad you're playing this game, I'm so glad you're playing it
this is the first stream i've ever watched
oh yeah, I played it a few days ago
@Jerma985 if you can do that you can do that
he cant make a good game that's not a good game
You have to eat a shoe, it's a lie
I would not be surprised if the devs made this game
@Jerma985 its not the same guy who just said it
he didnt say that he doesnt know that
@Jerma985 theres a secret boss if you do that
This is the best part of the game
Jerma you've been playing this game for a while, you know that?
How much is this game for? How much is this for Jerma?
jermaWalk BREEDER BRIGADE WE ARE THE SHIT jermaWalk

@Jerma985 just make it a "imagine being bad at a game" stream
I thought it was supposed to be the doom ost
jermaOld I've got a big car to drive jermaOld
@Jerma985 theres a secret boss if you do that

I hate you Jerma but I love you <3
@Jerma985 I have never seen a person so angry in their life
@Jerma985 jerma its only 3 hours, why is it still going?
@Jerma985 how does it feel to be the top clown in the land?
you can use it to craft things out of scratch
@Jerma985 You're gonna die in the first 3 minutes
@Jerma985 you need to put down a key
@Jerma985 it's not a bug, it's just that your controller isn't working
jerma your eyes are so fucking blurry right now
you can get a lot of good items for a lot of money
why do people have so much shit in their drink
@Jerma985 this is the only reason you'll ever be a successful streamer
I'm glad I could catch one of these streams
@Jerma985 I've been watching you for like 2 hours and I can already tell you're fucking terrible at games.

@Jerma985 it's a game about a computer, it's not about the games
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T JUST SAY "no" AND MAKE IT AN ANSWER
Is this the guy who got addicted to Monster Energy?
That's why you don't drink water. Drink it from the tap
@Jerma985 you know what they say about a man with short legs

@Jerma985 I'm not sure, you should get it sorted
@Jerma985 That's what you get for the new raid
Jerma I just got here can you turn it off
Jerma should play more of the old games
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2478. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.

@Jerma985 it's a real game how do you not understand it
I would like to see you play the original Dead Rising 2
i feel like the stream is just gonna be prerecorded
You need to get to the part where you die
@Jerma985 you're supposed to be streaming the final fantasy games
I'd rather watch a grown man play a game for the first time
@Jerma985 you can shoot the gun with it, its called a gun
I don't think this is the right place
I can't believe Jerma would do this to us jermaPluto
I love how much he knows about this game LUL

I'm gonna go watch the vod from 3 hours ago
oh wait i thought he was gonna say "hey guys"
How long has he been playing this game?
i wanna see if i can hear that
I feel like Jerma is like a small child learning to read
Jerma you've been playing this game for an hour

You're the only streamer I watch that isn't a VR game :)
@Jerma985 I'm in the bathroom can you pause the game?
He's gonna get so mad at that game
why are you trying to pretend to be a clown
@Jerma985 You said "Let's get a new job" the whole time
The last game was good, but this one is worse
@Jerma985 you are in the middle of a room
I think the last game was really good
I'll be honest I don't know how to deal with chat
it's a good game but it's not good enough to have a stream to justify it
why is jerma playing a bad game
You can't say that, you're gonna be banned from every game ever
You can just do a few voices at once
You're gonna get the bad ending because you're bad at the game
jermaHeart jermaHeart I'm just going to sleep, thanks for the stream
Jerma I'm so tired of this game and you're playing it.
@Jerma985 I'm waiting for the stream to start again.

I can't believe he got a sub right now
@Jerma985 please make a video of it for the awards
@Jerma985 you should have just made a playlist of all your videos
@Jerma985 i think its because you were supposed to be streaming for 3 days straight
@Jerma985 you can go to the sewer level
I'm on mobile, and the stream isn't working
You're just saying it because you're bad at it
Why does he look like he's from the original Dead Space
I just got here, why are you playing a childrens game

if you can't get a perfect perfect, then you're a moron
@Jerma985 have you seen how they're doing it?
@jerma985 theres a secret door on the second floor

I'm not even sure if this is a joke
@Jerma985 Did you ever play a demo of this game?

@Jerma985 you don't need to go in the water
@Jerma985 can you turn up the music in options?

Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 14. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I think the first time you died on this boss was in the last game, you get a bad ending.
I dont think you know what a toothpick is
@Jerma985 I want you to play the game so bad
He doesn't know about the secret door on the second floor

@Jerma985 Theres a secret level in the tutorial
@Jerma985 that was your best stream ever. thank you for streaming this game for me.
what the fuck did i just walk into
Jerma the only way to defeat this boss is to use a chainsaw
you have to go through the water and land on it
@Jerma985 I got an ad on the news, you're gonna win
we should make a collab where the streamer has to talk to the community
@Jerma985 you have to make a new account for the stream to be public
I remember when you streamed your colonoscopy with Joel
@Jerma985 You need to put the hose on the gas
@Jerma985 You need to make a new account for the stream to be public
how do you even say you hate this game?
how do you get in the shower with that thing
@Jerma985 Just a reminder that Jerma is a clown
@Jerma985 do you have any plans on playing more Kenshi?
Hes going to sue you for that LUL
It's not a hard mode, it's just a better way to play the game
i think he said you can dodge the knock
@Jerma985 Please go to the store, there's a loot room
@Jerma985 please turn off the music it makes the voices so much better
it's a real way to play the game
I really want to see the ending of this game
@Jerma985 stop talking about how good you are
you need to take the chainsaw out of the middle
they're not the same they're the same
i think the mod is just making you a character
I am a sub and I am not the actual streamer
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not sure
@Jer

@Jerma985 you are too old to know the truth
@Jerma985 I'm going to take a nap, take a pee break, come back when you're back
@Jerma985 It's like a high school dance for girls
it looks like a kids game where the teacher has a big dick
@Jerma985 You're too old to know the truth
YOU HAVE TO BE A SUB TO GET IN
The whole thing is just a compilation of clips from the past few streams
I can't believe Jerma killed that guy in the hallway of blood
@Jerma985 You can put the lights on the living room
I cant believe you're gonna go live with this one
@Jerma985 you dont have to get rid of everything
you should check out the new patch notes

What is this about the dog eating guy?
this is going to be a long one

hey guys i just joined the stream, why is he so angry
@Jerma985 do you know how to play animal crossing on the switch

I'm trying to get over it but I'm too scared to talk about it
@Jerma985 would you ever play a good game
I think Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 110. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@jerma985 you need to get the boots first
@Jerma985 are you sure this is the last level
this is just like the "I dont know what this is" joke
@Jerma985 you gotta play the second one too
@Jerma985 when you were a kid you did that
this is the worst game I've ever seen
why are you guys fighting when jerma isnt live
I'm not gonna do it because I'm afraid of the egg
This is the first time I've ever watched this stream and I'm so confused
@Jerma985 you are going to be the first to die in this game
@Jerma985 if you're a good enough gamer you can beat this game

@Jerma985 you can find some really good items in this game
@Jerma985 It's because you're the one doing the joke
@Jerma985 you should play the other one, it's really good
@Jerma985 this game is good, but it's not good enough to watch
you are in a cave with a bunch of giant rats
the only thing you can do is do it
is this the streamer that couldn't beat a puzzle on stream?
@Jerma985 Have you ever played Noita? I really like it.
@Jerma985 This is just the beginning of a horror movie

@Jerma985 You could just make a new game with the music
@Jerma985 so you think you're a robot and not a human?
i think jerma's having a hard time keeping up with all the rick and morty
when you're not streaming, you're always at the top of the stream
You can't tell me what to do, Jerma
@Jerma985 you should try to do a cooking stream with etalyx
why is he holding the camera like he's wearing a backpack?
you should do a cooking stream like you did with cooking mama
I'm watching the new half life alyx trailer right now
@jerma985 PLEASE do a cooking stream where you cook in front of a live studio audience
@Jerma985 That's why you're the only streamer I've ever watched.

@Jerma985 you said you'd play this one more time
I was playing the game and I missed it
@Jerma985 I'm sorry for being rude, but I want to refund this game
I can't wait for the next community content night
this game is just a ripoff of the dark souls of strategy games
the only thing i remember is that you would have been able to get the boots
I don't think he knows what a city looks like
I thought you were supposed to die already
@Jerma985 you should have played the new doom on stream

@Jerma985 this is gonna be a disaster, you're doing it wrong
@Jerma985 Do you think they'll make another Half Life?
@Jerma985 You can save the game if you want to
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
I want to see the end of the world

Jerma i love you but can you stop pretending to be bad at the game
@Jerma985 I have the exact same thing, but I'm not a doctor
He doesn't even know he's on the first floor
I'm so glad I caught the stream :)
@Jerma985 you need to get to the other rooms
I love how this game just makes me feel like I'm in a fever dream
@Jerma985 You're gonna need to go back to the lab
@Jerma985 put on the ring to summon the ghost
I've been here for like 15 minutes and he's STILL playing this
I can't believe Jerma doesn't know about the secret slime action LUL
@Jerma985 What if the dreamcast is like a 2000s thing
Jerma have you ever considered streaming on Twitch?
this game looks like a shitty mobile game
Can't wait to see Jerma's massive bellybutton again
I'm not gonna lie, this game looks great

I'm getting flashbacks of getting mad at Jerma for making a joke about a game being boring
@Jerma985 You could do it in the bathroom with the pee in it

You can't actually do that with the right controller
You have to make him live in your basement

@Jerma985 if you're having fun, why dont you just do it with the right controller?
@Jerma985 What about the time you said you'd be playing Halo Reach?

@Jerma985 why are you still in the bathroom?
@Jerma985 they can sell you the whole thing for a penny
@Jerma985 I'll trade you a copy of Cubivore
Jerma is a very good actor :)
@Jerma985 you can use the knife to stab enemies with it
@Jerma985 How do you know what it is
@Jerma985 Did you ever play Pokemon Snap? It's the same game but a lot better
@Jerma985 that's the one that's supposed to be your main focus
imagine not being able to click the screen
I'm not a sub, but i do watch Jerma
I want to give this a 7/10
@Jerma985 There's a crafting table in the middle of the room
Why do you do this to yourself @Jerma985

@Jerma985 You should play God of War 2
@Jerma985 you should play the new bloodborne trailer
how many of you guys are still watching this
you need to kill the other characters and take their stuff
I'm gonna be honest, I never played it
I feel like Jerma would be good at this game
@Jerma985 he'll say something bad if he gets too far away from you
@Jerma985 You need to get to the other islands first
@Jerma985 theres a shortcut that takes you to the next island
JERMA YOU CAN DO THE COIN TRACKS FROM THE OTHER THING
@Jerma985 You should play the game where you get to play as a girl
@Jerma985 you got a bad grade in the poll
@Jerma985 You gotta do it with the drone
@Jerma985 This game is like a flash in the pan
@Jerma985 I think you should be more than 1 point away from being in the top 10% of viewers of all games.

@Jerma985 you have to use the cheat menu
@Jerma985 is it just me or does the sound of footsteps make you jump

JERMA YOU CANT HIT THE LEFT BOTTOM OF THE HAND

@Jerma985 you can see the reflection of the lens in the top right
@Jerma985 i'm just gonna go ahead and assume you're actually a bot and not a meme
@Jerma985 you can check the footprints in the first place

this is the most painful thing ive ever experienced
@Jerma985 if you can't get past the first part of the game, you're not a real gamer
@Jerma985 the one where you're fighting a guy

@Jerma985 you are so good at this game
@Jerma985 they are going to make a video for it
I'm glad they're making this game again. It's a mess
I would rather watch you play this than this
@Jerma985 i was gone for a bit, can you guys finish the game so I can get back to watching this?
You have to be in the center of it all
I'm still waiting for the time Jerma is gonna be able to go live on time
what if it was like a carnival stream
@Jerma985 theres a secret room in the bottom left
I'm watching this with my 3 year old son.
@Jerma985 You can do it, just not as much as you'd like
I think you need to buy a new controller
@Jerma985 what if you were a kid and you got a new controller
oh my god i hate that voice chat
@Jerma985 how much money did you spend on this game
@Jerma985 you can tell me if you want to
@Jerma985 you look like a character in a horror film
@Jerma985 You need to be in the center of it all
@Jerma985 what if it's a VOD and you're playing it on stream?
Is this the guy that played the MGS 2 campaign on stream?
I love that you can just kill the zombies in one hit
@Jerma985 can you make the same joke over and over again?
DansGame it's just a joke i want to stop

I wish he'd do a 24 hour stream
I think he's like a lost cause in the last level
@Jerma985 can you please get a proper mic?
@Jerma985 is there a game that's just as good as the first one?
This is what it's like to be Jerma
YOU DIDN'T SAVE HIM HE WAS IN A POOP

I have to go to work in like 30 mins
@Jerma985 stop using the leash, its a trap
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
I'm glad you liked it, you should play it
I know I'm not ready for the stream to start yet
I bet he doesn't even know the speedrun
he just wants to see the movie in bed
The only way to beat this boss is to get hit by a car.
@Jerma985 I have a feeling you're a furry too
@Jerma985 can you turn off the music please
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's so nostalgic
Oh wow, that was a good joke Jerma! +2

I bet he's gonna give it to the guy
dude you can just press it like that
I like how Jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
i dont think i could have ever imagined what this game would be like
jerma is finally playing the game that was released yesterday
i wonder what he's gonna play today
I know what you mean
====================
I'm sorry to hear that. I can't believe Jerma is gone
I can't believe Jerma was the one to say that
can we get an "Etalyx is not live"
@Jerma985 we can see the message you typed it in the chat
you gotta make your own town with the devs
@Jerma985 I have a feeling that you can make a lot of money if you just use the game as an excuse to not stream
@Jerma985 why are you naked at your dentist appointment
why does this game have a ton of "long" missions
@Jerma985 it's like those porn codes that you read in high school
jerma I think you need to turn on the light
HE'S GONNA DIE IN THE GAME AND YOU'RE STILL HERE

"how do you get a lot of money?"
@Jerma985 I have a pic of you kissing yourself
@Jerma985 You're the only one who can do it
Is this the streamer that beat the thing on stream?
@Jerma985 You know what they say, "A good game is when you play a good game!"
@Jerma985 You need to be at least level 12 to play this
i love how he's just pretending to be bad at the game
he's never gonna play the DLC i know it
@Jerma985 I got a new laptop, you're never gonna get it
@Jerma985 i'm gonna be your teacher in high school
Jerma you're going to get a fucking heart attack
that was a real "uhh" it was an "s"
this is what happens when you dont give the money to the poor
@Jerma985 I have a picture of your ass https://i.imgur.com/kRzP2vU.png
@Jerma985 you could play an actual game like this but it would be so much better if you just played a relaxing game like jet set radio
you can't even win the game with the computer
@Jerma985 He is the only one with a voice
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO HAVE A QUICK PRESSURE
I wish I could live in the desert
@Jerma985 you're gonna have a hard time with this game
This is just the drill from the movies
I am not the person to tell you that
@Jerma985 you can still sell them for a lot
you can do it for free with a lot of money
@Jerma985 jerma i think you can use the shovel to shovel a tree
@Jerma985 they still have that one level in the game

@Jerma985 You can use the shovel to shovel a tree
@Jerma985 you can go to the moon moon2PREGIGI
@Jerma985 it's like the one movie where they're on a boat

jerma's gonna have a heart attack if he doesn't get the boots
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play anything else after this?
@Jerma985 how many times have you been timed out?

@Jerma985 I can't believe I'm watching a streamer play the game I want to watch
@Jerma985 it's a save file, you can't play it on stream

@Jerma985 This is the worst joke of the year
why is he wearing a backpack when he can't even see a map
@Jerma985 that's why you're so good at this game

This is like a game you would play as a kid
The inside of the house looks like a painting

@Jerma985 what if we kissed on the mouth? ðŸ˜³
@Jerma985 you can use the dynamite in the fire pit
@Jerma985 I think you can get a few items from the merchant to level up

@Jerma985 can we get a second wink please
I have a feeling it'll be a good stream
@Jerma985 I'm so glad you're playing this game :)
it's a shame that all these games have a bad ending
you can do it if you keep doing it
I can't believe he's actually playing this game
@Jerma985 you can get the bear traps at the training grounds

I love how much you're good at this game
@Jerma985 this game is like a children's book

@Jerma985 you can only get one perfect in a row
jerma if you dont stream in the next 5 minutes i will cry
@Jerma985 You can get the bear traps if you go through the training grounds
jerma would be a good character to play as
@Jerma985 You need to go to the tavern first
@Jerma985 you can change your category to "Most viewed video on the website"
I just got here what the fuck is this
Jerma you just made my birthday a thing
@Jerma985 I think it's because you're not a gamer
"I didn't even know I was in a movie"
This is a good game but it's boring
@Jerma985 is there any way to get the rat tail?
@Jerma985 you have to go through the training grounds
He doesn't want to play with you because he hates you
@Jerma985 They

@Jerma985 If you were to build a house, would you want to build it on top of a giant statue of yourself?
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure theres a test at the end of this game
I'm gonna do that with the rest of the game

@Jerma985 you can use the bear trap to get away from the ice
@Jerma985 What are you even trying to do
@Jerma985 i'm not sure what you mean, but you're the only person I've ever met who has ever left the server and isnt even here anymore
@Jerma985 you're the only one who's not on the same boat as me
@Jerma985 I'm watching this stream because I'm bored.
its a bit too early to be a jerma stream
you can just have the whole town be a city
you gotta go in the dungeon and kill him in one shot
is it a good idea to have this guy at all?
i wish he would just do a 24 hour stream
I hope he streams more Kenshi, because I wanna see the Kenshi streams
Jerma is a good guy, don't listen to him

I'm glad the stream is over, I'm so glad to see this game get some love
@Jerma985 please play the video game at some point
@Jerma985 just go to the gym and eat ass

@Jerma985 you're gonna get another couple days of streams
you could have just kept playing the game
he would be on time to do it
HE IS A SNAKE, HE'S STILL PLAYING THIS?

JERMA YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS TO PLAY

Jerma is just like you but with less intelligence

The game is about to crash jermaPluto jermaPluto
why is he using his full height as a shield?
@Jerma985 You can get the boots for free in the game
I'm sure that's not how the disc works
I'm not going to lie this is just an ad for a new fighter
@Jerma985 your character looks like a person
i can't believe this streamer is late jermaPluto
jermaDafoe this is the most political emote i have ever seen

@Jerma985 It's a good game, if you like it
i love that the game has a lot of them
@Jerma985 I'm going to go watch the VOD now
@Jerma985 if you want to play a game with him, you can go to the directory and find it
@jerma985 i saw a guy who couldnt make an argument for or against a game. i remember him saying something along the lines of "i dont care about politics"
The only thing I know about Jerma is that he is an AI created by the CIA
why does he have to be in the corner?
You're going to be the next Peter Griffin
It's like a reverse table tennis ball in the back yard
@Jerma985 hey did you see the new sonic trailer?

@Jerma985 you have to equip the grenade launcher

@Jerma985 I think you're missing a bunch of stuff.
YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR OWN MONEY AT THE SAME TIME
@Jerma985 there's a secret boss in the other area
I thought this was supposed to be a chill stream
@Jerma985 The only way to defeat the enemy is to use their special move.

The Jerma985 community deserves to be here, they deserve a good stream

@Jerma985 i think you need to get the backpack
my name is also Dr. Smoixan, and i am going to kick you out of my house
@Jerma985 You can only get a good mic with this game
@Jerma985 you dont need to press the button
this is the most underappreciated stream of the year
@jerma985 you need to get the boots first

@Jerma985 this is what happens when you play games
jerma just sit there and listen to us while we play videogames

@Jerma985 just go to the bathroom, get your food, and come back
I think you can put your pawns into the group, they can be friends
@Jerma985 You know what they say about a good chat? When you're not having fun, it's because you're not having fun.
This game is just an alternate reality where jerma is the bad guy
if you don't do it, you'll never get a sub
@Jerma985 the puke meter will be lower than usual
@Jerma985 you can also pick it up and put it back
I can't believe Jerma is streaming this game.
@Jerma985 I'm from the future, you're a train wreck
@Jerma985 you have to get the boots first
@Jerma985 Are you going to play the new Half Life?
you can't give the right to the king, Jerma
@Jerma985 can you make the game sound like it's going a little bit higher pitched?
@Jerma985 you're supposed to use it on the last floor
@Jerma985 would you rather play this game or the new half life?
jerma should do a fake stream where he just pretends to be bad at the game
Why is the Earth so flat? It's not like that.
@Jerma985 You don't have the boots. You need the boots first
Is this the streamer that lost to the first boss of Darkwood?
the stream was so good and you're still here

@Jerma985 the fish just wants to watch you play
@Jerma985 You're gonna get a heart attack if you keep going
the 5th book is the most boring thing
@Jerma985 it's not a joke, it's a way of life
this is the most beautiful game i have ever seen
I just got here. Is he going to play more Kenshi?
@Jerma985 that's what you get for being bad at it
jerma has a 2 day streak right now
"Jerma, I'm not going to do this"
this is the dark souls of assassins creed
@Jerma985 you have to use the right stick to aim the gun
you have to kill the guy to get the picture
jerma is going to be in the next greenscreen
I am so upset at this game
@Jerma985 You can do it, but it's really hard.
JERMA YOU HAVE TO RUN THE OTHER WAY
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure the part you were doing earlier is the most recent one.
we are all one guy now :)
@Jerma985 You are looking pretty good for your age
you're gonna get banned from the chat
@Jerma985 please turn off the music, it's making me so tired
@Jerma985 what if you're infected? what if you're infected?
@Jerma985 we know you have a bad stream, we just wanted to say that

@Jerma985 Do a fake Furry suit for the 3rd time
@Jerma985 You should play the games you like
jerma are you gonna play monster rancher 4
@Jerma985 please just stop playing this and play something else
@Jerma985 get a bear trap and put it on the wall
@Jerma985 i think you can do the infinite again
@Jerma985 you can get a ssd with that
@Jerma985 when are you going to finish the first level?
@Jerma985 do you have any idea how many times i've been timed out for being too rude
@Jerma985 you can make a minecraft server and make it run on your own
it's okay, you can have a little crack
@Jerma985 just use your phone to call your girlfriend
@Jerma985 Did you know that if you play as the blue bubble kid you can teleport to other blue bubble characters?
That was an absolute disaster for the camera
@Jerma985 you're gonna need to change your hair color
@Jerma985 this is the longest thing you've ever done on stream
@Jerma985 if you could give me a sub i'd give you a kiss
Jerma just do what you want to do
@Jerma985 the one thing you can do with that is that it's pretty easy
This is like a 2008 gamecube game
You can do the other one too :)
This is the most fun I've ever had watching a streamer play this
I know you are a big fan of Kenshi but you need to learn to play it right
@Jerma985 this is the one where you have to pull out your gun and shoot the victim
HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING TO US HE'S JUST PLAYING THE GAME
@Jerma985 its a good game for a bad streamer
@Jerma985 You can have a little cracker in the background
HE'S GOING TO PLAY THIS IN 30 MINUTES
why are you guys even here, you know this isn't cool
is this the streamer who ate a shoe ON STREAM?!
"I don't know if I can trust this, but I don't care"
if he isnt here in 2 minutes we're legally allowed to leave
can you actually see what the numbers are?
@Jerma985 This is a fucking shitty episode of Jermacraft
this is why you have to stream all the time
you need to bring the ball to the end
I've never seen a game in your life
"how do you get this far?" "a lot of things are easier than this"
you can run at your own pace with that
@Jerma985 i think this is why you're the best streamer
LUL why are you guys so mad at him
@Jerma985 You need to find the perfect number
this is like the 80s and
====================
, I'm gonna have to go to sleep
is he really making a mario game again?
If you don't like it, don't buy it
I wish he had a facecam so we could see him having fun
can we get some jerma's in chat please :)
you know, this is what happens when you don't have an internet connection
@Jerma985 Please turn your volume up, I can hear your feet
I'd rather watch a stream than a vod
You should get some of that sweet sweet sweet coffee
i thought it was the same guy from last night
this is the first stream i've ever watched
I can't believe you did that, that's why I'm here
It's just a fucking anime game, isn't it?
@Jerma985 theres a way to do that but you need to use a modded launcher
I have a date with my wife, we'll get married :)
@Jerma985 I think you have to change the game.
@Jerma985 Do you have any idea how to unlock the ending?
you need to play the new star wars game
@Jerma985 do you have the book that gives you a new character
we got some more of the same with this one
jerma you're getting old and you need to get some help
This is the most generic joke I have ever heard

@Jerma985 you can jump from the top of the tower
Jerma, you can't just buy a fucking jetpack
jermaChomp P U R G O L jermaChomp
I can't believe he killed that boss, what a psycho
I'm so glad he has a new hero
@Jerma985 you should do a second playthrough of this game, and have him try to figure it out
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO KILL THE OTHER CHAT
I think you just got a tattoo of a guy's face on your chest
the people who made this game need to go to jail
I hate that I can't even imagine what's going to happen
I got banned for saying that in the discord
@Jerma985 You're gonna do a fucking gravelly murder her
I can't wait to see this dude get his ass kicked by a guy wearing a football helmet
@Jerma985 it's a very early game game, but it's more than a few hours long
@Jerma985 they are, it's not the same, but there's a texture difference
@Jerma985 you know, I'm something of a gamer myself
It's okay to let the music play on your ipad
@Jerma985 I'm only gonna say this because you made a mess in the last mission
@Jerma985 dont forget to turn your volume up
I hope you're ready to get the boots in 20 minutes
@Jerma985 I think you need to get the boots
@Jerma985 you can get a better weapon with this one
@Jerma985 so this is what the community is called?
@Jerma985 Did you know that if you can read this, you can also write in a language?
Jerma youâ€™re like a child who gets bullied by his teacher
you just need to watch the whole vod
You can turn your cam on for some reason
I think you need to move to the north
@Jerma985 you should play the game that is coming out soon.

I thought this was the last time you played
@Jerma985 you're not going to beat the game, you're going to die
@Jerma985 there's a secret level in the back area
Jerma, please stop playing this game, it's not funny
@Jerma985 I'm trying to watch your stream. You're making me want to punch my wall.
@Jerma985 you can go to the right to the beginning
i just want to be a true jerma fan

@Jerma985 I was watching the stream and you were playing it and I was like
I'm trying to sleep can you do a funny voice
@Jerma985 will you be playing the new sonic game?
I hope you can read this message :)
I remember when we were the same height :)
@Jerma985 you can turn it off in the settings
@Jerma985 it's like saying you're a fly in a box
@Jerma985 did you see the new xbox game?

====================
@Jerma985 you can just use the pause menu to skip a level
@Jerma985 are you going to play the new animal crossing?
LITERALLY THE MOST FAMOUS THING IN THE UNIVERSE

That's the exact same thing as playing VR in VR
SOMEONE KEEPING YOU COMPASSED TO THE MONEY YOU'VE ALREADY MADE
just make a new account and stream on it
this is what happens when you don't eat your vegetables
@Jerma985 What is the next game you're gonna play?
Jerma, I'm just wondering, how long do you think this will be for?
I'm so glad that you're still doing this.
I want to see how long he's gonna go until he gets it right
@Jerma985 I'm watching this in an MRI, it's incredible.
YOU HAVE TO DO THE MOST AWFUL THINGS
i can't believe jerma is doing the tuber voice again
This is what it's like to be a person

@Jerma985 Are you gonna play the sequel to this?
@Jerma985 you should stop doing the voice so i can finish this whole stream
@Jerma985 you gotta put a few jups in the chat

@Jerma985 There's a secret level that is good, you can just skip it
@Jerma985 you have to wait for the "poop"
Jerma if you were to play this game Iâ€™d be 100% unsubscribed from you

I'm just gonna say you have the best music
the narrator is like a second from the mic
I'm just gonna say that, you're the best
@Jerma985 have you seen the face of death in this game?
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
you've been in the water for 2 hours
jerma is a zoomer so he can't be late
@Jerma985 you need to be able to shoot with your hand

The only way to win is not to play
@Jerma985 Do you have any plans for New Years?
I can't believe this is the same streamer who beat Dark Souls on stream

@Jerma985 just put it on your resume, its the only way to prove you're not a serial killer
@Jerma985 you can get a vive from the gamecube

JERMA YOU'RE SO BAD AT THIS GAME OH MY GOD
@Jerma985 Have you heard of a game called "The Surge"
@Jerma985 It's because you don't know how to open a door
You can't let your mom know about your sick and demented gambling addiction
Just do a stream where you do the same thing
@Jerma985 you need to do a little more damage

I have a weird feeling Jerma is the only streamer who can get a better ending than this
DUDE WHAT IF YOU WERE RIGHT THERE WITH THE DUDES

@Jerma985 are you going to be on the stream for another hour?
@Jerma985 how does it feel to be old enough to be Jim Carrey's dad
jerma is just a regular human in a zoo

if you can't beat the first level of dark souls you can't beat the second
i have a feeling this guy is gonna be a dickhead
I hope jerma streams on the weekend, so he can get some sleep
there is a way to get to the top
This is like the dark souls of DS2
Why is Jerma so obsessed with the dreamcast?
you can get another for free if you do a little bit of scuba
@Jerma985 I thought you were going to play Odama
@Jerma985 this is a really good intro to a game
@Jerma985 It's the 8th time you've said you're a liar
@Jerma985 would you play the super mario sunshine
@Jerma985 How do you feel about the amount of time you've been playing this game?
@Jerma985 I think you can only buy them at the merchant
jermaDafoe_HF I know what Jerma means by "Duck"
I want to see the people get their tickets
i like how it doesn't matter if they're free
I've seen Jerma do it before, I can confirm
@Jerma985 you need to get more seeds, it will be easier to get them
I'd rather watch the movie than this shit
I can't believe Jerma's gonna do the â€œwhat is thisâ€ joke
LUL LUL oh shit i'm going to the bathroom
the only reason i came here for the vod was for the clip
they have a new version of the game

DONT PUT THE PICTURE IN THE DISCORD PLEASE
i have no idea what im looking at
@Jerma985 Just wait for the next stream to start
@Jerma985 will you do the voice actor again
I'm not gonna lie, this looks pretty sick
The new Star Wars game is good, but it's not going to be a good stream game
That's a lot of money to make you do that
Jerma you're not supposed to be playing this, this is just gonna be a game of chance
i just woke up how long has he been streaming
@Jerma985 You're just too old for this game
@Jerma985 You can get the boots for free
@Jerma985 you should just play a game that isn't called "anime"
@Jerma985 You could do a whole stream where you just talk about how much you hate everything and you get like 3 million views
@Jerma985 You have to put them in the right order
@Jerma985 you should look at the next vod, if you want to see it again
@Jerma985 You're going to get scammed by this game
@Jerma985 it's the end of the game screen
@Jerma985 its been like 10 minutes you can leave now
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to use it in the right order

@Jerma985 please do another QTE jerma its just the beginning
@Jerma985 just give the controller to the main character
@Jerma985 you can play it with the person you just found
I think the game would just be called "Parappa"

@Jerma985 you're going to lose so many viewers if you don't start
i remember playing this game like 12 years ago
@Jerma985 You are not the same person that played the game
@Jerma985 Jerma, how do I get my notification to work?
that was the most stupid thing you've said
this is like the rest of the game
@Jerma985 You're supposed to just read the wiki
@Jerma985 Did you know that the ball was made of pee?
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, I'm a new viewer, and this is my first time coming into this stream. How is your hair?
@Jerma985 you can get an item from the shop

i remember when jerma played this game i loved it
@Jerma985 This is how you end up in jail
@Jerma985 you need to hit the thing that is shooting you
it's not a minecraft mod it's a game that was released on the original xbox 360
I'm so glad you're playing this game. I've been playing it for hours and I've never seen anything like it.

====================
@Jerma985 Just because you want to give us more money doesn't mean we should give you money
this is like when you play the game with your friends
I have no idea what's going on but I'm going to keep this message as a reminder to everyone that Jerma is going to die

I cant believe jerma is STILL playing this
I dont want to be here, i want to be in the place where I belong
@Jerma985 if you go to the edge of the universe, you'll find a way to escape
I dont think you can use the "say" button on your PC
@Jerma985 if you have a keyboard, use it
did you know that the sun is actually the center of the galaxy
@Jerma985 I have a really big pile of all the games you played
Iâ€™ve never seen a game this big before
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game, its called Sniper Elite

@Jerma985 You've been in a coma for 2 years and you're still in the tutorial.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT GOOD TIMES
@Jerma985 it's a good game, but there's a bunch of story stuff that you need to figure out, so its not really that interesting
@Jerma985 Are you sure you can just go to the first part of the game?
You can do this. you're the only one who can.
@Jerma985 do you know how to make a silent auction?

@Jerma985 you can use a d pad to skip the cutscenes
jerma has to read chat because he's wearing a diaper
you can actually use the cheat engine to do this
@Jerma985 you're getting a little too close to the mic
that would be the end of the stream
@Jerma985 this is not the only thing you need to know
it's just a small price to pay for salvation
they should have made a new game for it
"Your finger is too big. You can put it down."
Just wait until he finds the secret boss
@Jerma985 i saw it in a book and it was the same
@Jerma985 You are a hack, you can do anything!

@Jerma985 you should play the demo of the game
I'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 2 YEARS. YOU'RE STILL ON THE FUCKING CUBE?
@Jerma985 You have to remember that there is no such thing as a normal streamer

@Jerma985 if you want to be a good mod just put it in the options
@Jerma985 the sound effects in this game are fucking terrible
@Jerma985 can you not do that for the rest of the stream
@Jerma985 that guy has a license plate

@Jerma985 It's a fucking on rails game, and you're using a controller
@Jerma985 you can turn off the music in the options

@Jerma985 You have to use the boots in order to use them
he just came in and said he was going to eat the dog
I'm glad we finally got Jerma to do a joke that would be funny and funny for a stream.
@Jerma985 you need to make the coffee maker
@Jerma985 Is this a rerun or an early stream?

I think he just wants to see his girlfriend
@Jerma985 I'm going to have a heart attack if you don't stream today
@Jerma985 What if your mom is watching you?
I like how jerma985 doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I can't believe Jerma would lie about playing a video game
@Jerma985 what if the government is watching you

I'm gonna go watch the VOD, I have to watch this for the next 3 hours
@Jerma985 its the same as what you just did, it just took a second to set up
@Jerma985 I think you can use the power of the light to make the turrets invulnerable to fire
I think he is making fun of you, he is just being a little silly
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE GAME BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN PLAY
@Jerma985 can you explain the lore to me, i need to know :)

I don't know what's even going on, but I can't wait for the stream to start!
@Jerma985 you can get a lot of stuff from the shop
@Jerma985 if you run out of bullets in the air they're useless
you have to get a few more coins
@Jerma985 You can use a character to make them into a human
I feel bad for people who have to go through all this stuff LUL
He was also in the spiderman 2 video
@Jerma985 why do you keep saying they arent going to eat your ass
I'm glad we got to see you play this game.
@Jerma985 Just go through the room and look for a pipe, it's a good spot
Jerma is gonna do a full playthrough of Darkwood tonight

@Jerma985 this is the most realistic simpsons game
@Jerma985 I can't believe you were so invested in this game
@Jerma985 you're a good guy, I'm just a bad influence
@Jerma985 You can use the crossbow to strafe jump
I'm so glad I'm here for this stream

You have to beat the game before the screen shows up
It's a really good game, but not a good stream game

Jerma will you ever play the mystery science theater?
I think you're gonna die to pinwheel eventually
@Jerma985 Jerma, you're the only one playing this game.
I'm sure the stream will be good, we just need to watch some vods
i think you have to do it all in one go
why does everyone think theres a streamer right now
@Jerma985 you should play the vid of this game
you dont need a jump when youre in the air
The only reason to play this game is because you can play this game in VR
jerma is so good at this game LUL
LMAO I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE THIS GAME
@Jerma985 You can't open the door to the second floor
it would be like a fucking shitty third grade learning game

I'm gonna leave this stream and go watch the vod
@Jerma985 You can use a slot machine in this game.
@Jerma985 can you not hold a button for too long?

@Jerma985 it's a bad time to be naked
HES NOT A HEART ATTACKER, HE'S A BEAST ATTACKER
@Jerma985 What are you doing, I don't want to hear that

This game is way better than the last one
@Jerma985 what is the rule to not eat ass?
@Jerma985 how many days until you can not stream

I'm surprised they haven't done a sequel to this game
You're only making it harder for yourself to get a free pass
@Jerma985 if you dont beat this level i will scream
@Jerma985 you need to get the boots first
@Jerma985 JERMA IT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME YOU NEED TO DO IT
@Jerma985 why does the water come out of the ground?
I had a dream where a guy said â€œI'm not gonna drink any more milkâ€ and I drank it
this is the worst joke taking more than 5 minutes to set up
jerma is too small to be in the ring
Why is the facecam still on, what happened to the facecam?
@Jerma985 it's just a meme, you have to move on
@Jerma985 the first half of the game is like this
theres a huge difference between the two though
@Jerma985 can you turn your volume up please?
why do you hate the guy you just met
I can't believe Jerma just choked on his own vomit
@Jerma985 you have to destroy the satelite to save

@Jerma985 im gonna go to sleep, thanks for the stream jermaHeart
@Jerma985 please stop, my mother is dying PepeHands
I'm so glad this stream is happening right now
The whole game is a bit more complex than that
That's what you get for not taking the ring
I'm watching this on my tablet right now
jerma will never play the game he's playing
I mean that's what you do, right?
@Jerma985 You need to learn the game mechanics first
you can just run over people with it
@Jerma985 so theres a 50% chance that you will die to pinwheel
@Jerma985 you were in the bathroom the other day
You have to move the jump button in the options
@Jerma985 you're gonna get banned for that
@Jerma985 it's ok jerma we know you're a funny guy :)
@Jerma985 You have to use the bone shield
@Jerma985 you can also see where the ball is
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
@Jerma985 would you rather play as the frog or the chicken?

if you do it again you have to do it again
@Jerma985 do you have any idea how many people have died to this?
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game it's boring
It's not a car, it's a snowboard
@Jerma985 You need to go back to the water area

@Jerma985 theyre all 5'8" you're a big boy
jerma is this how you play games with your head
I hope he plays dead rising 2 for the gamecube
@Jerma985 I really wish you'd play this more
@Jerma985 did you see the new jerma video on the 2nd channel? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-HpE-zP8U
I don't know what to believe anymore FeelsBadMan
@Jerma985 He's not gonna be able to catch the fish
jerma's just gonna start his own twitch channel
I don't know what to believe anymore FeelsBadMan
the game is still going on what the fuck
@Jerma985 you should play the others, they have a lot of interesting mechanics
I hope jerma plays the "Dude, I'm gonna be a millionaire" video
@Jerma985 did you know that jerma is balding?
@Jerma985 Do you know how to do a backflip?
imagine being able to click a link in chat OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 you can buy a new controller from the market now
@Jerma985 It's like watching a child learn to ride a bike
I just got here. What the hell is happening?
@Jerma985 just wait til you get to the first part
@Jerma985 you can use the bone shield on the floor
@Jerma985 can you make the emotes bigger? its too big for you
@Jerma985 you can get a better sword from the shop
@Jerma985 JERMA DO THE CHARACTERS FOR THE NEXT RUMBLE
@Jerma985 you can just use the bone shield on the floor
You need to make a whole pizza and eat it
how much did the game cost you? @Jerma985
@Jerma985 I'm sorry Jerma, but you can't afford to do that.
I just want to get out of here
i can't believe jerma is the one that beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 he's not the boss, he's the last boss
@Jerma985 just got here, is this the ending of last stream?
you can change the name of the music, just change it in the options
@Jerma985 You should play the new Pokemon theme
@Jerma985 just got here, is this game still boring?
@Jerma985 it's a meme to keep the chat going
@Jerma985 the game audio is
====================
WhyYouTookMyPancake_HF why you want to play this game?
this game is gonna be so boring without the music
@Jerma985 You know what makes you hate me? My name is Jeremy.
@Jerma985 I'm going to have to take a break, can you start over
@Jerma985 why do you keep falling into the lava?
If you put a kid in a box you can get the super kid super powers
@Jerma985 you could do a tier list of your tier lists
did you know that you have the same face as a bear
youre just a good guy to bring up to others
jerma is gonna get a whole lot of attention from this
i dont remember this scene from the movie
@Jerma985 you can get another gamecube from the lab to beat it
@Jerma985 You're gonna need more money if you keep playing this game
you need to be close to the sun
I can't believe Jerma is late this time
i've been waiting for like 30 minutes for the carnival stream
You got a lot of these, you know what they say
@jerma985 it is not the same, the menu isnt broken
@Jerma985 please play a good game like sorcery or whatever it is
I hope he has some of the weirdest gamer moments this year
why do you think they put the old people back in?
@Jerma985 make it so when you're too high you have a giant rat on your face
@jerma985 you can use your fart to make a noise
That was a great joke, thanks for that one
You should just go to the doctor and do a physical
you can go to sleep now if you want
it's a lie, the world is a simulation
Jerma is going to get his ass kicked by this
@Jerma985 You have to find out the truth
this is just like the boston arcades game
Why did you put a bunch of people in a room together?
@Jerma985 is it true you have a single ear
@Jerma985 do you think you'll play the new pinball game?
@Jerma985 the dev was in chat and said "silly game"
@Jerma985 you're gonna die in like 4 days
@Jerma985 You're getting a little bit old, there's no way you're going to make it this far
I was a 4 year old when I played this game
you need to get to the safe house first
you guys are all mimics, copying everything someone says
i think you can only see what a person is doing
@Jerma985 its a meme game, theres a new one coming out
@Jerma985 I know it's a joke but can you please not get mad?
@Jerma985 you're gonna get 2nd jerma with this joke
you need to be close to the sun
Is this the streamer that couldn't beat a 2 year old
you have to be closer to the sun
@Jerma985 If you get 1 shot, you can get 1 shot
@Jerma985 If you wanna leave, you gotta get one of those "go to the store" machines
I'm glad you're having fun, this game is really fun
@Jerma985 I know it's a joke but can you please not get mad?
i hope jerma has a good day :)
If you're good at something never do it for free
this game is a reference to the movie "The Departed"
you can't do it all at once, you need to do the rest
you have to find the one with the one
@Jerma985 is this the part where you die?
@Jerma985 I love the way you talk about it
its like the black and white 2 intro
this is just like that one game with the bookworm adventures
@Jerma985 you should play the hit and run modded version
I thought it was a game where you fight a boss
@Jerma985 you can get it for free with twitch prime
imagine how much money you would have spent on a carnival stream
@Jerma985 get your d-pad on and you can do tricks
I'm glad to see the chat is calm and composed
@Jerma985 YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GIVING ME A DREAM
@Jerma985 why are you so bad at this game?
You can always use the Big Book to turn them into a book
I remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You have to go left, left, right, left
@Jerma985 how many bits for you to play the game?
@Jerma985 it's gonna take you an hour to do the puzzle
I can't believe
====================
 HOW DO YOU KNOW
I've never seen a game like this in my life
@Jerma985 that was just a joke but youre doing good
@Jerma985 You can use the same weapon on the same spot
@Jerma985 I just got here, why is there a 10 foot tall man in the top right corner?
@Jerma985 you need to go back to the start of the game
jerma you are an egomaniac, you will never be able to play this game again
this guy beat dark souls on stream?? jermaVenus
you should be able to do a jump kick for the first time
he's gonna have to fight the dog in his dreams
this is gonna be the whole stream LUL
@Jerma985 theres a save point in the cave
you could have just gone for the head
@Jerma985 you have to beat the final boss
he is still in the dungeon room LUL
you guys remember when jerma said he was gonna play nancy drew?
jerma i'll pay you 5 dollars to play this game
@Jerma985 Why is the cow so sweaty? I've never seen a cow so sweaty in my life
can you imagine a game where you have to figure out what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 you can get new items from the workshop
YOU NEED TO KEEP PLAYING THIS WHILE YOU ARE HERE
I can't believe he didn't buy the infinity gauntlet
@Jerma985 you can get a weapon upgrade from the shop
@Jerma985 you're literally the only person I know who actually likes your game, its a meme
jermaIQ "I want to try all of these"
@Jerma985 why would you not use a harvester, you don't need to press R to use it
oh my god i cant believe this is a real stream
@Jerma985 you need to see the three tracks
@Jerma985 I thought you were supposed to be the villain
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead :(
@Jerma985 What if the game doesn't work for you and you just want to play with a controller?
the only time i know you're going to get them
@Jerma985 can you turn the volume up a little?
Iâ€™ll just leave if you play this game
you just wanted to do the dreamcast voice
DUDE YOU DID IT THE FIRST TIME YOU DID IT
@Jerma985 please play something else, it's not worth it
@Jerma985 you could just walk into the lava
@Jerma985 you need to get the boots to level up
this is the best stream of the year
jerma just go on a rant and you'll be fine
I want to see you get to the top
can we get an H for the dog
@Jerma985 When do you think you will get to the end of the game?
@Jerma985 get the boots to level up the skills
@Jerma985 when you get back to the garden you can sell them for more
this is gonna be a good movie night
@Jerma985 You need to finish this level or else you'll be stuck for the rest of the game
theres a way to go to the top
@Jerma985 the one with the garfield hat is a good one
@Jerma985 you have to get the boots to level up the skills
@Jerma985 this is just the ending to simpsons hit and run
@Jerma985 can you not just go back to the start of the game?
JERMA YOU GOTTA GET THE BOOTS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
Why is there a giant rat in this game?
@Jerma985 There's a gun you can pick up that blocks the tele
@Jerma985 why are you using the bathroom at the start of the game
@Jerma985 if you want to change the music, go back to the beginning and start over
@Jerma985 I'm telling you, I'd rather have a family
@Jerma985 if you want to play the game just play it on your own
Jerma I'm going to have to take a shower, can you pause the stream?
@Jerma985 you can go back to the beginning of the game
@Jerma985 You need to make your own house
I'm so glad I was able to watch this stream
you can just go to the other end of the map
@Jerma985 you can actually use it in the menu to see what items are in your inventory
@Jerma985 I think you're supposed to be the one with the boots
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the rest of the game?
i'm too scared to watch this stream to play the new pokemon game

jermaWalk LET'S GO! SOMEONE PLEASE GET OUTTA HERE jermaWalk
I wonder if he can build the stairs
@jerma985 you don't know how to shoot a bullet, it's not your fault
@Jerma985 youre the one that thinks that's bad
@Jerma985 you have to get the ring from the mister guy
You're just doing a stream where you talk about how fucking bad the game is and it makes you feel bad for playing it.
@Jerma985 You should do a poll where we vote for the best stream
@Jerma985 is this the streamer who died to pinwheel
@Jerma985 there is a mod that changes the enemies to yellow
@jerma985 i'm getting some good news for you
You should have bought the actual game instead of playing the DLC
i don't know what the fuck i just came into
@Jerma985 you can just do a backflip for the items
@Jerma985 would you rather eat a whole pizza or eat a whole sleeve of oreos and eat it on stream
the first part of the stream is gonna be a bit too boring
He said he was gonna play it today
Jerma can you please turn the music down a little?
jermaOld I remember when I was a kid jermaOld
I don't know what's going on but it sounds like someone is farting
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the hell is going on?
@Jerma985 You should play this game again and not the last one
@Jerma985 This is the most recent level. you didn't even take damage
@Jerma985 This is a new level and you're losing to a kid's game
I'm watching the VOD, what did you do
@Jerma985 It's actually an actual reference, it's just the "Bowl" logo
I'm back, why is Jerma so fucking ugly?
@jerma985 so you're going to play Team Fortress 2 again?
what a great stream you have to be having fun with these games :)

how many times did he die to pinwheel
jermaWalk LET'S GO WITH OUR BITS TO KILL THE COW jermaWalk
@Jerma985 You can find it in the DLC
you can get more than one house from this house
Oh yeah, I forgot about the one where you died to Pinwheel.
Jerma is just streaming a movie at this point
@Jerma985 its because the tree isn't up to date with the game
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
I think Jerma is kinda boring for a streamer
i think he was talking about something else
I've been watching for years and still haven't finished it
@Jerma985 this is why you dont play games with guns
i want to see jerma in a full bathtub
so this is the best place for people to watch jerma
@Jerma985 you can buy the other items from the shop
@Jerma985 when are you going to play the new shrek campaign?
@Jerma985 i love the song I wish it was this quiet
hey guys i got a new sub :)
@jerma985 you need to put in the green "free money" line
Jerma you need to stop playing this game it's making me dizzy and I'm losing my mind
@Jerma985 hey I have to go to work soon, can you pause the stream?
@jerma985 it's like a fever dream, you're going to die in the next hour
@jerma985 You can buy the other items from the shop
I'll get you a bowl of cold ones
This is a remake of a 2002 game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is what happens when you smoke crack jermaJup3 jer
====================
 to the second game is still a good game
@jerma985 please do the "I am not going to eat this shoe" voice
@Jerma985 I remember when this was a porn game
@jerma985 YOU CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THIS
Just dont be a streamer and play the game as a regular
I mean, he has an interesting history, maybe he can tell us about it?
@jerma985 you can do it, but it's against twitch's terms of service
why does this game look like a shitty bazooka
This is a Jerma stream. We are watching him play this
@jerma985 you have to go to the store, they are closed
@Jerma985 you can do it in a few hours
@Jerma985 is there going to be a "jerma vore stream"
That's why you don't wear clothes. You don't wash your hands.
you dont need to grind to beat the game
he didn't get a call from the police
what the fuck happened to the other person
@jerma985 I would never watch this as a kid
he's never been in the pre-pre stream chat
@Jerma985 I'm gonna give you $100 if you play the DLC.
@Jerma985 you can do the voice with a voice changer
you can make any name for an enemy from enemies
what a god of a gamer, he has a HANDSOME collection of games
@Jerma985 you have to buy the DLC first
@Jerma985 you should play this game in the background
@Jerma985 you can do it in one go
@Jerma985 please go back to the town and go the other way
@Jerma985 if you were to play one of these games, what would you choose?
@Jerma985 play a video game with the dog
@Jerma985 please stop, this is for your mental health
if you can do it i'll take it
this is the most difficult game ever LUL
@Jerma985 You can do it in one go :)
@Jerma985 Hey, can you give us a little history of your family?
@Jerma985 you can get them at the store
@Jerma985 you have to beat the game before you can buy the DLC
You can do it, but it's against twitch's terms of service
jerma I was watching the VOD and I was really confused.
I think I saw this on the news
@Jerma985 He's going to kill you with a chainsaw
Why is the wall of flesh look like a toy gun
@Jerma985 you can use the shortcut to the right
"you're so tall that you can't see me"
"i have a loisense, you can have it"
I hope the new game doesn't have this, I want this to be too
you can't save that much money on an item
@Jerma985 I'm sorry you had to go through the pain
@Jerma985 have you tried using the middle mouse button?
@Jerma985 please say something funny for me, im bored
LUL he thinks he's going to beat the level
you can just go back and buy the DLC
You can't take the DLC without a HAND SIMULATOR
I love how you just ignore the people who are spamming
You're going to make your own family dinner
Jerma is going to break into your house
Is this the streamer that beat the tutorial boss?
@Jerma985 the game will give you a heart transplant
@Jerma985 is that why you're always late? :)
@Jerma985 if you have a friend, ask him to play you
this is the most boomer thing ive ever heard
@Jerma985 that guy is a top 1000 streamer
It's a shame he doesn't have a wife
@Jerma985 you know what else you need to have
LUL HE HAD THAT IN HIS HAND NotLikeThis
@Jerma985 you need to get more money from the DLC
I can't believe you just killed that guy
I'm so glad I caught this stream, Jerma! I'm so glad you're playing this game!
what if you just have the same name
@Jerma985 just get a new computer and plug it in

jerma you're not gonna win the game again
@Jerma985 We know you've played this game before, can you explain it?

It's funny because when you get a certain amount of coins, you get a random number
I'm going to be so disappointed if Jerma doesn't get the boots
You can do it, just be patient and don't worry about the health bar
@Jerma985 you could make a game with the wii mote and use it for a video
@Jerma985 do you have any idea how many times i've had the same thing happen?
Jerma do you ever wonder why you're so bad at video games?
i hate the game and i hate this game

@Jerma985 are you gonna stream with etalyx? :)
It's been like a year since Jerma got addicted to it

@Jerma985 that is just a lie, you need to read the manual
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 I think you can use a grappling hook
jerma, how do you think you would do a 24 hour stream?
If you die in the game you die in real life
@Jerma985 I have to use the bathroom, can you pause the game for a second?
You can't get the boots in the first level
You can't even get the boots in the first level
Is this the streamer that has a mental breakdown on stream?
why is the sound effect of the game driving me nuts
@Jerma985 You can get the boots for the boots
@Jerma985 how many tickets to get the boots?
@Jerma985 have you heard of the new name, jerma985
====================
i'm in a really long hallway and i can't get up

I can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
I don't think he's actually wearing the same shirt
@Jerma985 It's not that hard. It's just that it's too easy
@Jerma985 he's going to play the dlc if you keep playing it
i can't believe jerma died in a clown car accident jermaPluto
you have to pick them up and throw them into the river
that's the point of the game, to not be afraid of anything
i wanna see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into
how are you so bad at this game
the person below has a very unique sense of humor and style
I just came back and he's still playing this?
@Jerma985 I got a new job at a local gym and I've been working there for the last 6 years and it's not working out
@Jerma985 you can also just turn it off in settings
@Jerma985 theres a tutorial on how to use the mr. bean mod on steam, it's just as good as the official one
how can you be so bad at this game
I'm on the phone with Jerma, he's trying to convince me he's not streaming
@Jerma985 You don't have to do this in real life
I'm not sure if you're still here.
@Jerma985 you can check the left side of the screen
@Jerma985 theres a big, well-known company called Aerospace
"the only good thing about the west is that theres no way you'll be able to get the final mission to the final boss"
@Jerma985 You can get a refund if you did a bad job
I'm gonna go watch the VOD now, just to catch the end of the stream.
@Jerma985 how long until the next stream? jermaVenus
How are you so bad at this game?

@Jerma985 you have to go back to the start of the game
@Jerma985 you have to go to the room
@Jerma985 I think you can get another one of those
@Jerma985 You should do a stream where you just talk to yourself, like a 3 hour game
@Jerma985 You look like a total war vet
he's not going to get to it
This is why you don't play the Monkey Game
@Jerma985 you can go to the store and buy more stuff
he's not going to stream this game he's gonna be playing it for an hour
@Jerma985 is this a lot of effort to be sure
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you don't play a good game
I don't like the new Jerma IRL update
he's just going to be staring at the camera for an hour
jermaIQ he's like a clown who needs a clown nose
It's a bit late but this is the best game I've ever seen
@Jerma985 I'm going to bed. I have to catch the end of this stream.
I bet you can't even make it through the tutorial
@Jerma985 go back to the farm and open the chest
Jerma I think you need to watch this movie
Why is the chat just like this every time you stream
i was here when jerma was born jermaPluto
I can't believe jerma is fucking dead :(
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -192. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
What the fuck is wrong with you guys
Jerma you're a 33 year old boomer, what are you doing
theres a door in the middle of the room
@Jerma985 I made a level based on this game
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
theres like 3k people here right now
I'm getting flashbacks to when Jerma ate a shoe and then died
@Jerma985 you can make the shark carry you
@Jerma985 you don't need the boots, you can just get the boots from the town portal
imagine not having a keyboard on your keyboard
@Jerma985 put it in the background of your dream
Jerma what
====================
@Jerma985 you look like the kinda person who eats a shoe
its not the same with this one but its good
@Jerma985 why are you pretending to be bad at the game?
I'm gonna take a shower and come back and he's still streaming
@Jerma985 That's a normal sized human being you fucking monster
just like the old days, when everyone used to pay at the gas station and they just stood there waiting for the next minute to be delivered
@Jerma985 just go to bed now, you'll be fine

@Jerma985 You gotta get a better weapon, this one is for the weak
I just got back, did he die yet?

@Jerma985 I'm a mod, but I don't like the way you say things.
I'm going to watch a jerma stream in the chat

@Jerma985 You should do a playthrough of the
====================
 if you're gonna play this
why is this a 4chan board game LUL
"i'm just gonna put the rest of my time into this game"
you know what I think? This is going to be a good stream
when you're a kid and you have a shitty dog
I think I'm gonna make a new account
Jerma is gonna start the stream with a t-pose
@Jerma985 You can make the second level with the DLC
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's got a memory of that time when Jerma was in the hospital
How do you not know how to use a gun?
but i cant join the discord anymore jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Do you know how to use the gun?
@Jerma985 you are the top channel point chump, dont lie to us
@Jerma985 you can play as the griffinsteed character
you have to talk to the guy in the ring
i'm not ready for the L O L stream yet
YOU CANT HAVE A POOP CHAT NotLikeThis
@Jerma985 I'm sorry Jerma I can't see your stream
@Jerma985 you should do a cooking stream with a lot of people
i wish i could watch jerma play with a computer jermaPluto
i am so fucking excited for the carnival stream
@Jerma985 You should play the new Animal Crossing when it comes out on Switch
@Jerma985 If you wanted to, you could've bought a bunch of funko pops instead.
Jerma you just got a booger in your mouth
@Jerma985 you got one of those boogers out of the way
@Jerma985 you have to do the fall joke
@Jerma985 you are so bad at this game
I thought you were gonna say we'll never get to the end of the game
didnt you say that you'll do a half hour stream
I remember when I was in the hospital
Jerma you look like you're in a fever dream
Jerma is going to get a second arm
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 we can legally consume his skin
this is the most boring stream ive ever watched
Jerma has been live for channel is not live
I hope this is a good game for you
i have no idea what you are talking about
This is what happens when you put a bunch of chemicals in your mouth that makes you not scream at the chemicals
you can sell the tickets for real money
@Jerma985 there is a new fortnite map, it's called "fortnite warband"
@Jerma985 You need to go to the bottom of the screen
that's not a weasel it's a bad omen
jerma if you had a burger youd be eating it right now
this is the worst stream i've ever seen
jermaWalk GUYS, I'M THE GUY, AND YOU GUYS, I'M THE GUY jermaWalk
@Jerma985 hey jerma can you help me build a stairlift?
@Jerma985 so this is how you get the boots?
jermaPluto jermaHeart its okay to hate on jermaHeart
I can't believe this streamer doesn't know how to play video games
I can't believe he's never played a real game
jermaJup3 jermaJup4 this is how we treat you
You're just pretending to be bad, what's wrong with you

@Jerma985 Jerma please play the Contra Hard Corps OST
I remember when I was a kid and I loved it
@Jerma985 why do you have the same voice as that guy
@Jerma985 you could have just played the game instead of watching the vod
@Jerma985 this is the one you killed and took his soul
This is gonna be a good stream LUL
@Jerma985 it's okay to hate on jerma, he's a cool guy and he's never going to let you down jermaHeart
@Jerma985 I can't believe you've been subbed for 9 years, it's almost been 9 years since I last saw you, I'm so sad :(
@Jerma985 Why would you
====================
it's too late, you're already a top 500 streamer
that's why they don't have a time limit
It's going to be a wild ride, I'm excited
I just realized the guy who made this game was in chat and not the game
@Jerma985 jerma, you should play something other than this one.
i hope he doesn't start the stream with this game
@Jerma985 That's just how it is in real life
it's the only game where you're not a real viewer
i like how jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
he's gonna play this for the entire stream
"I'm just going to beat the shit out of these guys"
I would be so mad if I knew about that
i feel like i'm in a fever dream
You need to pay for the tickets, you're not going to win
@Jerma985 you can build an army with them
@Jerma985 when are you going to play Black & White 2?
@Jerma985 You can go to the other area to get new boots
@Jerma985 you know you're supposed to watch your own stream right?
jerma i have to go to work soon
If you see a fish you are cool
I'm really glad I got to see this game play out
did he just say that he's going to play the rest of the game?
jermaIQ A streamer is not late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. jermaIQ
i hope he's playing this game and not kenshi
@jerma985 you have to tell us the ending
the only thing i know about you is that you're in a basement
Oh, it's just a fucking dino's life simulator
i'm gonna get so excited for this stream that i'll be really confused
i want to play this game with my dog
@jerma985 play some of the simpsons hit and run
You have to beat the game to unlock the ending
This is what happens when you dont play with your friends
JERMA GO BACK TO THE WIND AND GET THE HIGH GROUND
Jerma this game is an allegory for your addiction
@Jerma985 I'm glad you're playing this game, it's really fun
jerma, you need to stop being a dickhead
@Jerma985 theres a good video on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1X_V3n2cE

@Jerma985 you're not even close to a 10 hour stream
i wanna watch this stream in the shower
The music in this game is very good
@Jerma985 you dont have to do anything anymore
i miss the old jerma that would start the stream and say "this is the best part of the stream"
@Jerma985 put on the speedrun music please :)
jermaDisgust i cant believe they got me jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 You need to get to the next area first, you need to get to the second one first
@Jerma985 do you have a full size dong?
This game is like an elaborate cover up
I bet jerma could beat this in one try
i just got here why is he playing this again
that's why you don't wear that robe
@Jerma985 what about the 50 bucks you spent on the carnival stream?
@Jerma985 make sure to never use the controller
jerma is just a small, dumb, and ugly character
i dont think theres a single person that doesnt like a little bit of that
i think you just have to find the most common song
I have the same feeling. I'm a little old but it's not that old.
jerma is gonna be the first person to ever stream on twitch
@Jerma985 Is this going to be the last stream of the night?
I've been gone for a bit, what did he say about the carnival stream?
@Jerma985 We know your stream is a comedy
he's going to play the game and not realize it
you know you can get like a 20 dollar rent for the house
jerma has a full time job and is still not streaming jermaPluto
@Jerma985 What is the best way to make a pizza?

@Jerma985 If you get it at the end of the stream, it'll be the 100th wink
@Jerma985 you can do that with the cheat code
Jerma, if you want to win a free iPod you have to pay for a membership to the Apple Music club
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
@Jerma985 hey can you finish this level, thank you :)
this is just the rat movie all over again
Jerma how can you be so bad at this game
I think that's a good way to do it
JERMA YOU SAID YOU WOULD PLAY THIS ON STREAM
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game

i thought it was gonna be a funny moment
Jerma is going to have a breakdown from this
it's been like 20 minutes and he's already lost it
@Jerma985 you should play the game where you play as the sniper
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SLIPPER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SLIPPER
@Jerma985 Thats why you have to go through all the bosses
@Jerma985 What is your favorite type of cake?

HE HAD TO DO THE TRIPLE GUY IN A ROW
@Jerma985 youre right. It's not hard to do, but not so hard to get

Jerma you have to play as the two characters in the game

@Jerma985 stop with the bad jokes it's not funny anymore
@Jerma985 it wasnt the dog, it was the dog
@Jerma985 you're gonna get so mad you need to use the bathroom
@Jerma985 i think you can just change the game
@Jerma985 can you do the "you're a child" bit again?
i can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
this is the best game in the world
this is the first time i've ever seen a jerma stream
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
Hey guys, Jerma here, sorry I didn't hear about you being a furry.
I think the only thing you can do is to kill the npc and
====================
DoesNT work on theres like 6 or 7 people here
I just want to watch the vod with you
I think the camera is too close to the mic
You don't get to watch this game for another hour
he was talking about the stream not us :(
@Jerma985 i was in the shower when the last stream started and i just noticed your face
I can't believe he's not playing Kenshi again
he was just fucking around with it and then he forgot about it
@Jerma985 I'm not sure if you're joking or not
The man has no face, but his voice is like a demonic satanic satanic satanic satanic satanic monkaS
@Jerma985 I'm going to eat my own ass
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
I don't think he'll be able to get past the first level
this game is just a glorified flash game
jermaPluto I didn't even know there was a stream
I dont even know what game this is
@Jerma985 your hair looks so nice today :)
He's gonna be doing the voice at the end of the stream
i can't believe this guy is streaming right now
you can do it if you don't play the game
you need to take a break after that
it was a little too much for my head
what if the whole thing is just a joke
You need to get a mod that makes it so that you have to eat a ghost pepper on stream
If you dont play the game in the next 10 minutes I will literally lose my shit
didnt he say he was going to play something today
jermaSun jermaMerc jermaVenus jermaEarth jermaMoon jermaMars jermaJup1 jermaJup2
@Jerma985 you have to wear the same costume every time
@Jerma985 you have to look at the ground to dodge
@Jerma985 you have to put it in your mouth
@Jerma985 Did you know that if you turn the game off it turns on and you have a FULL bodycam on?
I love the way he says he's going to do this in 30 minutes
I miss when Jerma was an actor jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Do you know what a number generator is
@Jerma985 have you ever considered playing anything other than the original Dead Rising 2?
That's a lot of money, you know that?
@Jerma985 you said you'd do more on this one
I want to be the one to say "SHOW ME SHOW ME"
Dont worry guys, he just finished the VOD jermaHeart
i have never seen someone so invested in a game before
@Jerma985 can you do the old, old joke again?
The game has some really cool effects, but they don't really translate well to the screen.
I thought this was gonna be a chill stream
Just had a bad day at work. LUL
@jerma985 Just dont do anything stupid, you'll be fine
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
@jerma985 this is like a 20 year old game
we should have a contest to vote for the worst joke of the year
@Jerma985 You got a new character, remember? @Jerma985
if you put the boots on, they'll fall off
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO BE AT LEAST 22 IN THE SERVER TO BE A REAL GAMER
@Jerma985 jermaPluto your hair looks like a balloon
SourPls THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING GOOD SOURPLS
@Jerma985 That's how you say your dog is big
i'm scared of being banned for saying something so controversial
you're on the right side of the ocean
@Jerma985 would you say that you are an asshole
I've never been more nervous in my life
@Jerma985 I want to say that you're the most handsome streamer ever
i can't believe jerma lied about star wars
@Jerma985 can you get me some lemonade please
@Jerma985 i just joined and i'm already crying
If you can't handle me at my worst, obey your thirst
I'm going to be a very important piece of the pie
@jerma985 are you playing this for the entire stream
he's gonna spend all the bits on the rats
I'm so fucking scared for my life right now
@Jerma985 You can do it, but you have to play it again
@Jerma985 What about the time you ate a shoe?
@Jerma985 I think you can just add "Halo Reach" to the end of a channel point
he is going to die in the end
you can do it jerma, you
====================
ers are more than just RATS
imagine having to pay for a sub for someone to have a good time LUL
@Jerma985 It's not a jerma stream, it's a Jerma twitch chat
@Jerma985 i heard there's a mod that makes it so you can have a chat with no matter what chat is going to be
@Jerma985 that's a good idea, you should have a handcam on
@Jerma985 hey man, you're having a good day :)
@Jerma985 If you say hi to them, they'll come see you
@Jerma985 you need to do the 100 jumps first
if you're not paying attention, this is the game
JERMA IS GOING TO BE LATE IN 2 MINUTES
I hope Jerma plays the new Animal Crossing
Jerma I'm trying to watch the movie but I can't stop thinking about you
This is the same guy that played on the PS2
i wish i had a single person to talk to
I bet he can't even beat the first boss of this game
@Jerma985 You need to turn the lights off for the secret ending
i thought you were going to do a new years stream
jermaOld the car was gonna go through the wall
its been 2 years and he's still in the tutorial
I've never played a game like this before
@Jerma985 Why do you have a diaper on?
@Jerma985 you have to use a water pump
i think theres a big spider in your mouth
I remember when Jerma used to stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 i am glad you're back jermaPluto
i wish i had a single person to talk to
@Jerma985 go to the zoo, there is a huge exhibit there
jerma if you dont play the game im unsubbing
@Jerma985 you should play the OST to get a little more rhythm
@Jerma985 If you are just enjoying the game, why are you playing it?
I think you can go to the beach and swim in it
i love how jerma is so cool with these things
I'm having fun but im scared of the worst part of it
I love that this game has a pretty nice soundtrack
I'll be honest, I don't really know what's going on
i dont think jerma can get past this level
I can't believe Jerma is dead. He's gonna get his ass kicked and all of chat will be sad
Why does Jerma think he's a real person?
@jerma985 I'm gonna need a high iq to get through this level
If you beat the final boss, you can unlock the true ending!
I'm gonna miss the carnival stream if it's not today
i miss the old jerma that would play games
@Jerma985 you can actually do this with the free trial
Hey, is that the guy that ate the shoe?
@Jerma985 this game is really easy if you just play it at the prompt
if you can't find it then you're gonna have to try it again
he's trying to sell you a fake gamer card
i think its because youre not a true gamer
@Jerma985 theres a secret ending you missed in the other room
jermaOld get me some of that RAGE jermaOld
if you're having a good time, you're not playing it
i only have 2 messages left on the chat, but im watching a vod of this
I can't believe he got a 4th location
@Jerma985 you can do a level in this game
is he still doing the 5th game? LUL
i just got here, what is going on
you need to play the music to this
i would like to see some more jermaOld
@Jerma985 you're not a true gamer unless you use the Zinc badge
@Jerma985 its not a fake one its a real one
imagine how many jerma subs you would get
@Jerma985 You don't know how to use the arrow keys
@Jerma985 I would be so happy if you played this game for the rest of the stream.
@Jerma985 you can only do it once, you'll get timed out for that one
@Jerma985 can we get a new emote for the new emote?
i cant believe jerma said it was a joke
@Jerma985 Jerma, can you say "Hey" for me?
@Jerma985 theres a secret ending you missed in the other room
@Jerma985 i cant believe you got a new emote
@Jerma985 I think you need to get the boots
I'm gonna leave for like 15 minutes and then I'm gonna say it's too late
I think

@Jerma985 this is the first time i've ever seen you play this
@Jerma985 do you think you'll ever stream Dead Space?
I hope they add a 2ndjerma video

jerma I'm going to eat my own hair on stream

@Jerma985 i'm from boston i know it sounds weird but you're the only streamer i know who's played this

Jerma if you beat this boss I will donate 5 dollars :)
@Jerma985 he was talking about his upcoming carnival stream
@Jerma985 you need to be more aggressive in the fight

@Jerma985 you know theres a button to the right of the top left
@Jerma985 I have to go to bed now, can you finish the last game of fellowship?
Jerma, if you ever get to the part where you die, you have to stop streaming forever

I was here when Jerma died, that's why he's streaming this
I wish he'd play Death Stranding again
@Jerma985 You can check if you're the one that's dying by playing this game
I dont think you can say it so it doesnt matter
this is why you're the best streamer
I just got here and I'm already losing my mind
@Jerma985 you know this is a time travel thing?
i just came back and you are still doing this
@Jerma985 you're gonna need to do a lot of taxes to get a job
This game looks pretty good. The graphics are nice
I just realized that I've never seen this game before
@Jerma985 how much money do you have in the bank
jerma, this is the most you can do to a serial killer
jerma is the type of guy who only goes to the store for food
You need a place to store your stuff
@Jerma985 would you say that the stream is boring to watch?
@Jerma985 you're supposed to hold shift while doing a move
I know what it is but not what it is
jermaPluto I can't wait to see jerma lose to pinwheel
@Jerma985 can you finish the game please :)
You're just sitting in your room, waiting for the stream to start
how long has jerma been stuck on this boss
@Jerma985 if you dont finish this game i will be VERY VERY VERY VERY very VERY VERY VERY VERY very VERY VERY VERY
@Jerma985 You need to play the whole game on stream
if you want to play you need to play halo
@Jerma985 your character looks like a Jerma character
@Jerma985 stop being a psycho youre making me wanna play tf2
@Jerma985 I've been in this room for like 20 minutes

You know you can make fun of us when you play these games
@Jerma985 you can jump over the rock you can jump over the rock
@Jerma985 You're gonna get a lot of those
How much did they pay you to play this game

@Jerma985 you can do a big jump over the wall, it's only 1 block
i dont think theres a real pizza hut in my area
imagine if jerma wasnt a character in this game
Why did you make a bingo card for this game?
I really like the bit where he says "fuck it"
@Jerma985 you can make a hotel in the city with the cash of course

The guy from the mario tennis game with the skateboard
it's not a real dentist, its a dentist who knows his patients
@Jerma985 go to the bar and ask if it's open
@Jerma985 When are you gonna play the sequel to this game?
@Jerma985 I can't believe you put a hulk in the fight
you guys are getting +2ed to this one
I can't wait for the end of the stream
@Jerma985 the game is for a 14 year old
Hey jerma I'm gonna go get a drink, can you pause the game?
@Jerma985 you should go to the store and buy a new car
imagine having to get up at 5am to go to the supermarket and they had a bunch of weird stuff
@Jerma985 please make sure you dont play with the girl in the mirror, she is very awkward and you wont let her go to bed
@Jerma985 You have to wait till you're close to the entrance of the building
@Jerma985 You have to do the tutorials first
jerma is not even gonna play this game
@Jerma985 you should be playing TF2 right now

@Jerma985 you can have a lot of sugar too
I'm so glad you got the boots jermaHeart
@Jerma985 is this a battle royale stream or a real life one
This is how you make money in GTA
@Jerma985 you can also make it so you can play as a different character
@Jerma985 you could say that with the voice changer
@Jerma985 he has to pay for your gamer license
It's like they don't want to be friends
@Jerma985 I am going to be honest I really hope you don't play this game
====================
 IT WAS NOT THE FUCKING GAME
@Jerma985 you should go into the menu and choose the options
I don't know why you're so bad at this game
@Jerma985 you can go to a restaurant and order a burger and have it be at the same time
i hope theres a streamer that isnt just a robot
oh god i cant wait to see the rest of the game
@jerma985 I'm getting a bunch of Dr. Pepper recommendations, should I?
i was gone for a couple hours and he's still playing this
i thought you were gonna say "I'm not a furry"
You're the only one playing this game :)
chat is moving so fast nobody will see that i love you all
I hope jerma plays a game for the first time. :)
@Jerma985 That's a really good idea, as long as you're having fun :)
i am one of those people who cant even beat a game
i hope this is the last stream of the stream
i'll be back in like 2 hours when he's done with this game
jerma you need to get the boots they are so good
how can you be so bad at this game
@Jerma985 can you repeat the question and answer question please
@Jerma985 when you kill the final boss, you can grab the meatball and eat it
this is the best part of the stream
@Jerma985 it's been a while since you did the backpack voice
I think you can take the headset off while you're streaming
@Jerma985 Do you have any plans on playing The Thing?
@Jerma985 go to the menu and choose the options
he only has 1 day left before the stream starts
you can probably buy a house in this game
@jerma985 if you do a spill joke you get to play the game
i hate the way jerma is using the "dont"
oh god its gonna be a dumb stream LUL
@jerma985 theres a new vod of the episode of daphne and shes a lady with a cat
if you dont eat a shoe you are a furry

@jerma985 you can't really have a combo if you're not a good match
@Jerma985 I just got here, what is this game?
I can't believe you'll be playing this for 3 hours
i am so fucking addicted to this game
I just came back. I dont understand this game
@Jerma985 you know this is a jerma stream right?
this game is going to be a disaster
jerma doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts
i dont think i can handle this game
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 im a mod, just the best of friends jermaJup3 jermaJup4
@Jerma985 did you know that you can use the arrow keys to move?
@jerma985 just wait for the clown to jump off the top of the building
I'm glad you are finally playing a game with your full attention span
You're a good guy, but you don't deserve to be there
i'm gonna miss the last stream so i guess i have to watch the vod
how many times have you guys said that
@Jerma985 would you rather have a big rat or a little rat?
@Jerma985 you can move the body part to the right
@Jerma985 if you don't do the voice, I'll be mad jermaSun
oh fuck that was a funny joke holy shit
jerma has been live for 3 hours and 45 minutes
I got a feeling this is gonna be a very good stream
oh god the jerma face is in the corner
I'm back from the bar and this is worse than the last game LUL
@Jerma985 have you seen the new "old games" ad?
i was gone for a couple hours and he's still playing this
I remember when this was a cat cafe stream
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
@jerma985 get the video of that cat from your TV
jermaWalk WE'LL DO IT FOR THE LIVING jermaWalk
I just joined and I see that image
i miss the old jerma that would just show his ass
I think you can skip it by doing the move tree from the beginning of the game
@Jerma985 theres a ton of rooms, go through them
@Jerma985 stop streaming and just listen to the game
that's why he went to the store to buy a new controller
I hope you guys have all the time in the world

@Jerma985 you know you're not supposed to say anything
i think they're using the same place they were in last year
@Jerma985 you can still hear the music in the game
Can you wait like 5 minutes to get back to the tutorial?
i have a large volume slider on my phone so i can hear the audio
@Jerma985 It's going to take you a few hours to complete the tutorial
I'm going to have to go to bed
we need to bring jerma back to life
i wish jerma was a big chad like minecraft
i hope the first part of the game was a good one
You're the only one with a good voice

I'm not gonna lie this is really hard to watch
@Jerma985 You have to do it in front of the camera.
@Jerma985 They're all going to be in a ditch, they'll have to find a new home.
@Jerma985 You were supposed to do a stream where you would just sit in silence and just let chat play the game.
@Jerma985 You need to look at the screen
jerma please just play some of the games that were on the list
@Jerma985 you should make a channel for it

@Jerma985 Can you tell us a funny joke please?
jerma has been live for 10 minutes, he's already forgotten about the game
the game is a bit slow, I cant hear you
@Jerma985 you can beat it on easy, just hard

The first person to do a stream is Jerma
Can you add a "streamer only" option? @Jerma985
you're the only one that has to play this game
@Jerma985 You can go into the dungeon and kill the wargs
Jerma you need to keep killing them to get the true ending
I love how much I love this game
I'm going to go watch the VOD of this game

@Jerma985 what's the best way to learn to do the voice?
@Jerma985 You should play the game with your friends
Why are you trying to get me to buy a used car

HE'S GOING TO GET KILLED BY THE END OF THE GAME

@Jerma985 you can get the boots with the boots
@Jerma985 you can get the boots with the boots
@Jerma985 Make a video of the stream where you do the voice

The game was rigged from the start, the runner had to go back to the previous game
@Jerma985 when are you going to play stalker?
Jerma, you don't have to play the game to understand it
@Jerma985 you can't put a little water in there
this is the guy who beat dark souls on stream?
this is going to be a long stream
the house with a granny in its walls
@Jerma985 JERMA THE FASTEST YOU CAN JUMP IS 30 MINUTES
I hope the stream ends with a shitty prerecorded joke about how you're "trying to kill a guy"
@Jerma985 you have to do the song again
oh god oh fuck he has airpods in
LUL you didn't even know that was a thing
@Jerma985 Jerma I don't think you can do it
@Jerma985 your message was not sent because you are sending messages too quickly.
@Jerma985 you can keep the winks and then use the "start the stream" button
@Jerma985 I'm a little hyped for you to play this game again, I really enjoyed it!
JERMA I KNOW YOU DONT HAVE TO DO THIS
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR 20 YEARS
what the fuck is wrong with this guy
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
@Jerma985 He's going to accidentally spill the wine
@Jerma985 you can do that with a knife
@Jerma985 You should play the original version of the game, it's not a sequel
@Jerma985 just like the real life, make it
I think the bug's life was invented in New York
you have to get to the top first
If you just read the last 3 books then you'll understand why it's called the Scoobie
You can't do it, we can't see your messages
@Jerma985 You can do it with a knife
you can just pick it up and throw it
@Jerma985 do you know what a car is
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 hey guys get ready to jup in 5 seconds jermaJup3 jermaJup4
this is so boring, it's gonna be like this for weeks
@Jerma985 I'm so happy you're playing this game
I feel like this is a really good game
jermaOld I remember when Jerma used to stream
@Jerma985 so you're saying you don't have to play it every time?
@Jerma985 If you use the confetti on the bridge it will break the shield
LUL HE'S GONNA BE LATE FOR THE NEXT THREE STREAMS
He's not gonna beat it, he's gonna shit his pants
@Jerma985 It's only a thing if you don't actually have to play it

theres a way better way to get the ring
@Jerma985 It's a 1 way street, you're not in a shitter
@Jerma985 you can't change the difficulty, you have to do the tutorial
I can't believe I'm listening to the same song for an hour
@Jerma985 just hold down the buttons while you play
@Jerma985 This is a ploy by the game devs to make you play more
@Jerma985 do you eat your face off to eat ass?
@Jerma985 That's the reason I always liked your streams
I can't wait for the stream where he streams mario maker
@Jerma985 dont forget to put the key on the table to activate it

@Jerma985 you can get the boots by using the tavern
How many times have we had the same day?
@Jerma985 You're not gonna play this for the rest of the stream
you're not supposed to aim for the head, you're supposed to aim for the tail
@Jerma985 just got here, why are you talking about your penis

I dont know how this game works, but it's good
@Jerma985 Why is the sound effect so fucking loud?
Jerma you are going to make me fucking scream
@Jerma985 you should play the game for the authentic 2018 Jerma experience
chat please stop being so mean to jerma :(
Jerma, you should try and get a sense of what you're doing
that was the worst thing i've ever heard

@Jerma985 you can still get a good luck run at the end

Jerma is gonna be so mad when he realizes he lost to Pinwheel
It's okay Jerma, we all know you can't be the best at anything
@Jerma985 you're supposed to be in the chair
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you don't read the subtitles
The new design for Jerma's face is pretty awesome
@Jerma985 no one is going to play this
this game is not even worth the time
you were playing the whole game you dolt
@Jerma985 you can do it if you want
Is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
@Jerma985 you're the best gamer of all time
I'm a woman, I don't care about what you think :)
you can have your hair back in your office
I really want to see you play the second one
It was a baby, and he was crying.
I swear to god, all this chat ever does is find the one person with the lowest IQ and copy paste whatever that brainded moron posts.
the way he spoke it was perfect for the game
I can't believe he's gonna do the same thing again LUL
@Jerma985 It's a different game, you're on the same level
Just a few of those faces, you're done here
why is this game so fucking hard to watch
@Jerma985 theres a save file in the game
@Jerma985 theres a free .exe you can play it on your pc
it has been over a year since he played
@Jerma985 dont forget to put your facecam on
@Jerma985 you have to use the star button on the map
@Jerma985 you are in a coma, please wake up
@Jerma985 if you want to leave, you can just go into the map and go back to where you came from

====================
It's really hard to find the sound clips
jermaOld cant wait to get my old ass
jermaOld hi jerma, how's the stream been today?
@Jerma985 I think you just got really mad at the tarantula
I like the "Butterfly" sound effect in this game
@Jerma985 I think you have to do something to get the boots
@Jerma985 get the damn boots, they're really good
@Jerma985 You should put your face cam on the other side of the screen, it's really good :)
imagine if he was a fucking malding streamer
I just realized that Jerma is the only streamer that's been here for 2 hours
I'm glad the bad ones don't come back
this is gonna be a good one for the drew crew
my dad is a firefighter and he said i can't do this anymore
the more you say it the more youre gonna say it
@Jerma985 If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 You're gonna get banned from Twitch for saying the word
I hope Jerma makes a return to the TF2 days
@Jerma985 You have to hit the 2nd button in the menu
I'm so confused, is this the streamer that died to Pinwheel?
You're like a grown man with a diaper on, no way you could do this
you can get a car at this level
@Jerma985 did you see the new tf2 update
@Jerma985 please make the funny voice it's very funny
Dont forget to clean the bodies from the bodies
@Jerma985 If you want to kill an animal, you just have to leave the game.
@Jerma985 Have you ever played the new open world game, "Star_ Skylines"
@Jerma985 you can keep your gift sub money :)
I'm a bit surprised you have a 2 week badge
that's the one that's been in my room for like two weeks
You know what's cool? The sense of achievement on this game.
i only know "jerma" from the creator of jerma
I can't believe the last boss was only for the survivors
@Jerma985 just turn on face cam so we can see your pogs
i would just do it in the discord
I'm pretty sure Jerma is just making up his lies to cover up his bald spot
i think jerma actually wants to play this game
I'm surprised you have a 2 week badge
@Jerma985 use the rat voice actor to make a rat movie
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself jermaDafoe
@Jerma985 You have to do the voice again
@Jerma985 you're gonna die and die and die
@Jerma985 You're not gonna get the boots are you
@Jerma985 Jerma I'm a furry, please stop with the stream
@Jerma985 you have to press the buttons on the game
i was just looking at the wink and thought to myself "I'm gonna wink"
@Jerma985 you can put the plastic in the cartridge and then you can put the plastic in the disc
jerma would rather stream himself getting slimed than have a good game
I bet you can't even find the right one
i'm still waiting for the second stream of this
you can use the iron golem to get around
@Jerma985 You can also put it on a bucket with a bucket on it.
@Jerma985 I'm a furry and I love you
@Jerma985 what if you need to go to the bathroom and piss
@Jerma985 This is going to be a disaster
This is the most intense game of all time
if you're good at something never do it for free
I think he was trying to get to the next level
@Jerma985 im trying to eat but im dummy thicc
we're in the endgame now its time for the challenge
he's not even here, he's just on his way
this is the best thing to happen to the stream
@Jerma985 The movie is the only way to watch it, so it's okay.
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
I'm not really sure but I think you can climb the slide if you're using a grappling hook
@Jerma985 you need to get some of the items
this is going to be a disaster LUL
jermaOld I remember when I was a kid
why does he keep doing the same thing over and over again

@Jerma985 you can see the hulk's teeth in the top left
is this the streamer that beat the jump king challenge on stream?
@Jerma985 put a bunch of pictures of your face
I can't believe I'm watching a VOD PogChamp
@Jerma985 its not just the camera its also the sound you make when you fly
You can do that in any game with like 4 buttons
you can do a lot of shit with that controller
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 534. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I would love to see this game again
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure that's what i expected
@Jerma985 If you have the game on, you should play this
I just got here and I already know this is a joke
@Jerma985 why is this game such a fucking pain in the ass
@Jerma985 theres a secret on the top right
he'll be the one to die in the first 20 seconds
@Jerma985 You just put on the voice of an old man

you're still gonna be up at 3pm
jerma, i have a question for you. why are you making a toddler dance with a car
hey guys im watching a vod and its pre stream chat, what do i do?
@jerma985 I'm in your room and I'm about to die

This is the dark souls of video games
jerma is going to be a new president
@Jerma985 you should play one of the super mario rpgs
@Jerma985 How can you even do that, you are going to die
just like a booger every morning at 7 AM
I don't think he knows how to make a gun
it's just a bad ending, the devs just made it to a movie
jerma do you eat ass or is it just me
I'm going to bed, thanks for the stream!
@jerma985 theres a secret in the car, its in the other car
@Jerma985 you have to click on the guy

@Jerma985 You're a hero, you can do anything
@Jerma985 the guy below me is a fucking moron
HE'S LYING ABOUT HIS PENIS STREAM D:
@Jerma985 you can use it to scout with the scout button

@Jerma985 I thought it was a new emote

@Jerma985 jerma you are not a true gamer

this is like when you had a car accident
This is going to be a disaster, like the last

@Jerma985 it was originally the previous 4, but this is the last one
@Jerma985 You can still put the oil in the tank
i'm getting flashbacks of that scene in the movie where the movie was about a guy who just got stabbed

the first time jerma played a video game
why would you need a chainsaw in a game
@Jerma985 you can tell it's bad if you have a third eye

@Jerma985 if you get to the top of the castle you can level up your troops
oh i gotcha. i don't even know what a child is. i just remember it being a joke

@Jerma985 you were so excited about the other games
@Jerma985 can you play one of the other games i missed
i dont know if this is a joke or not LUL
@Jerma985 You need to save your energy for the next stream
@Jerma985 I'm a doctor, I see what you mean
I hope jerma puts on the clothes again
@Jerma985 how many bits for you to tell us the truth?
@Jerma985 I'm going to have to look at a medical doctor tomorrow, please be patient.
Why is Jerma playing a second game after this?
You have to get the right controller first
you got a whole chat to watch :)
jerma can't even remember the last time he played a video game LUL
@Jerma985 I can't believe you got a dragon
you need to save your energy for the next stream
why does this game have a giant black hole
JERMA IS GOING TO GET THE SHIT ON HIS MIC
jermaOld_SG i'm out of the loop, he's trying to get me to play league of legends
I'm
Jerma, please play the game, I need a break
why is this chat so horny right here
@Jerma985 theres an old man below her head
why would a man be a porn artist
@Jerma985 Why are you doing this to me, please stop LUL
@Jerma985 That's the real one from the game
The real one was the game. I like it.
I'm not sure I expected it to actually catch on fire
i dont care if you do it or not
I dont watch streams unless it gets a streamer
jerma this is a game why would you do that for porn
jerma the dog has a heart attack you ding dong
the best part of the game is still urinals
@Jerma985 you'll get it out of the way before everyone explodes
He didn't get it out of the way because it wasn't on the map
i think ive watched it a couple of times it seems pretty fun tho, it really shows
I'm so glad you didn't take it easy on yourself.
hey jerma i hope you liked the vod :)
I was only here for the bit badge thing
@Jerma985 You can make an ice cube with this, its much faster
@Jerma985 if you're a big fan of Jojo, you may want to try this one
the only good thing about this movie is the music
Jerma you've got like 5 hours in this game and you're literally playing this
you dont put in a fucking 2 star sign lol
It's the same voice as that one game you played. You're the bad guy
@yoyu__ that makes it way more complicated as you try and solve it
I just saw in a stream where a boomer named jerma is playing a game thats so bad, what a psycho
how many times have you killed yourself? like 5 minutes
just wait until he finds out he can shoot yourself when all shots are empty again PepeHands
I didn't get what I was looking for
theres literally a whole different level for him for free, there's like a week to go to
@DivusP It's the only good VR game you didn't play
hey guys. I'm trying to watch JoJo's Bizarre adventure.
Jerma can you explain to me the purpose of the pee pee poo poo emote?
no they never are they have to eat one
I mean, I have a good case study for it
I just had a few people say that shit in chat
Is this the streamer that got hit by a car LIVE?
the fuck theres no way in hell that would work
"Hey guys, i get a flight tomorrow afternoon"
i just got back in and he is making a funny noise?
its a shame they didnt do more green eggs
hey guys howd i get that jermaDafoe bit
@Jerma985 This is the one where you play as a boomer trying to figure it out
it has to be that shit at the beginning OMEGALUL
he's only looking around the corner, what do you get from a 3 min intro
Why would anyone like this guy? All I get is that he's a Boomer
What is this I have to get through the game so fast?
why don't you just use the spear like that
that's not a fucking gun, that's just a fucking regular flamethrower
I can barely imagine jerma playing minecraft like this LUL
This place is like having three bathrooms
can you pause i need to go to the bar
Jerma I didn't beat this game because you're bad jermaDisgust
imagine not having a sub jerma not playing this
this is the real jerma in the head
is this a remake of "this is not my dream" "what do I do"
jermaSour is now the sourness, now he has to eat the dog
i am now watching Jerma985 in 2019 by far
the fact that jerma is going to be late is making me feel bad for him
It's my birthday in 10 years, thanks for to remember my name
I think its better just to not go back
if we dont tell the mods at least one game sux
@jerma985 jerma you missed like 90% of the movie
just play the game at the same time
oh god damn how is this stream not live?
i guess if he doesnt start in 5 minutes I will be fine with a new emote :)
this isn't even a good game anymore LUL
@Jerma985 You can use melee to clean up the trash you get
you got to the boss with the best weapon in the game
i've never seen this guy in a real
 row is just a big ass one
@jerma985 you will win if it's 1 or 3
Jerma985, when will you make some games? :)
I don't want to live in the desert :)
This is not the streamer that beat the game. This is only the stream jermaFireman
I think i should get one for a friend
imagine how much money you'll have next time
jermaWalk THIS IS THE END OF THE STREAM jermaWalk
I like how you cant do this in real life
jermaWalk the stream is over and the viewer count has increased by like 50%
theres like two towers of a different kind
I'm just gonna call every single one of them. No need to explain why
I was here just now but I think he's already been muted by himself in his room
You could do a really interesting voice for this boss too, you just get this joke too late
that's not very hard to think about, but idk
the one I saw was "jermaWalk" that was the worst name ever
I'm excited to be the one asshole who calls me a slur
@Jerma985 The sound effects in this game remind me of something from that song
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
he's just talking to himself, he needs help
@Jerma985 when you run up the hill you get a special bonus
i don't like how youve got this game out of the tutorial
That's what happens when you put the whole chat in sub only mode LUL
i thought I heard a voice to my right
it's like that "jerma wants it all" meme
jermaSour the best part of today's stream was jermaSun
jermaVenus I don't know why i get so excited about a streamer making fun of me. Im a pleb
@Jerma985 You'll get so tired and sick of having your internet go out tomorrow
the most important part of this mission is going back the way you came to
That's not even a real dream, that's an imagined dream
This is what your brain looks like LUL
we must demand his hand be put down
you've never played the game before? :) you're a boomer
that's what i thought when i started playing games
@Jerma985 how many times do we have to get to the bottom of this before you go live please respond
that person has a gun and won't shoot
Jerma can you put on some ear headphones please
Is this the guy who got MELD OUT on STREAM?
it's not the whole story this part, there's another level to it anyway
JERMA STOP I AM DYING OF HONSTINESS THIS IS SCARY
@dabsfordinner I'm so glad you're using it when you should be doing all aus game like the series
how do you put so many people in a home
If you get a few guys to shoot a sniper, you can do this
what happened to Jerma? i missed it :(
He's just getting his face ripped off by the voodoo doll :)
he can only do one but hes the one
@TovarischNick i mean its literally a stream lmao
its always been a joke to me. i try and make people uncomfortable though
if you get a few people to shoot them then it's not as bad as it seems
this is the best, my favorite movie of all time
@jerma985 you really are a fucking idiot, this joke is being wasted too much.
You can't have a baby when it's a corpse
why do you want to do this to us?? D:
so you have a whole lot of free money
how the fuck did i see him in chat?
i wanna see you eat the shoe :)
@shelby_kun i don't even know what its about anymore
@Jerma985 this is why YOU're bad at video games
@Jerma985 i used to use it for my birthday
you guys are not allowed to leave chat, hes getting the bad end
I remember when Ster was a funny man
hey guys what happened to the stream i missed :) :)
It's like a 10 hour stream every day @Jerma985
i hate when i see someone who says "this guys"
jerma is gonna show us what he got
I love how Jerma is just standing in the center of town and just walking like this
jermaTV is a great emote to try to capture all of our faces
The next community night is on Sunday. jermaPluto
why did they not do a stream? they did this all themselves
I hope you're going to need another pair of your own right now
jermaOld How do i find the internet?
 tigers is an actual monster
i'm so fucked that i hope i didn't lose a wink or two
This is one of the BEST streams imo
i got a nunchuck on my face and it just went off again
@Jerma985 i think you're too good for this world
I think the mods just want to see you win
I like how you're in a bad mood
the audio is too loud for you @LanoBelsho
@jerma985 i just started the stream and just got here, what have you done about the poopbutt?
@Jerma985 i want to see u pee on the floor :)
I mean, he was a good comedian, but that's like 90% his personality.
i was about to say it was good
it's a good thing I never played it
it has to go, the game is pretty good
you might need to change it in your car
What do you think of the new TF2 update?
can you please stop going down the stairs
@Jerma985 you said it looked like a tree
its the most embarrassing thing on the whole site that jerma hasn't seen in months monkaS
isnt this the guy that beat Dark Souls 3?? LUL
Jerma and the Gorilla at the top of the tower, one of the best games
I left for a bit what is happening
jerma you gonna read this on stream? @Jerma985
this sounds like the end of the level but with the music
@Jerma985 if you lose at the next game you get the key
@jerma985 You have literally nothing to lose, but your friends
You just need to buy more guns, like what are you talking about? :)
Why is this streamer so mad he is in the game?
oh yeah you can play all of those on stream
it would suck if u didnt get rid of jerma's shirt
@Jerma985 Can I see a picture of your asshole please?
"what are we doing guys, this is just a test"
He said if he had been playing it I would have already done it
@Jerma985 have you ever thought about doing a stream around the carnival stream?
how long have you been streaming jerma you're a sick fuck youve got to start streaming sooner
why are you listening to the wrong streamers
@Jerma985 why do you keep getting timed out for saying that about yourself?
I just hope we get more streams like that
It's a good thing, all it took was for a guy to make a mistake and somebody noticed it @Jerma985
it says if youre not being timed out youre not being timed out
Jerma said he would beat this in like 3 days
I want to say something about this stream that Jerma has taken an arrow to the knee as his only remaining outlet
that actually sounds like it's from the beginning of the video LUL
just go kill some nazis, they have more range now
I think it's probably just the virus or whatever
its the most weeb thing i've ever seen
Jermas making the most insane thing that ever happened LUL
@Jerma985 is this your first time playing a DOS game
i hope you all have a great night <3
imagine if you did that and didn't get any of it
Jerma your mom is crying at you trying to play with you on the toilet
@jerma985 please explain why you play games and how you can fail
@Jerma985 it's so much better for the first game
Jerma you are getting a headache for not doing it
@jerma985 do you not know what an oat smells like btw
@Jerma985 Jerm it's almost 30 here in Texas, can you hurry?
this is like a worse city zoo game
@Jerma985 Just get the coin, you already got 3 coins
JERMA JEESUS CHRIST JERMA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PLEASE WAKE UP, IM BREASY AND I LOVE YOU
@Carnie200 he does not care, we know it lmfao
You're getting timed out for saying that about yourself
@Jerma985 can you do a tier list of your tier lists? :)
@Jerma985 can you play this without jumping off the cliff?
@Jerma985 If you dont kill the boss that could be your main skill
I love having a bunch of money to spend on a single game, like the casino or whatever
He should be playing a real game of thrones game LUL
@Jerma985 i saw you in the middle of the movie
jermaWalk ANY CRACK CRACK CHICKS IN CHAT? jermaWalk
He is literally the worst character in all of LOTR
LIVE ACTION STREAM FROM THE VEGAN
@Jerma985 Please make a level with the skeleton crew
how did you know how to cook @Jerma985
Is the guy with the big arms okay?
@mikeweiner i'm something of a weeb, i hate it
This dude is gonna fall of his chair lmao
Jerma why did you make this game so hard?
@yenwenlen did it get fixed or have the bad end happened now?
why is there a dude all fucked up?
its just a picture of jerma's asshole LUL
@Vynixa it's a game that takes a long time to understand, so the speedrun is usually a few hours LUL
I need to hear how much the game pisses me off
@Jerma985 have you ever seen this game in a real life game like The Movies?
This isn't something you get over a year like the others?
@Jerma985 There are more people going through those fires, what happened to what was in them, why did they all die?
im glad i got to see jerma play minecraft
If Jeremy is so good, where's the rest of us
how many more minutes until he figures it out
Jerma985 i believe the game is telling you to go in this room
he's got a bit of a weird mustache hair on his face
Jerma, you know if anyone wants to join my discord server :) https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985/clip/GoodMildingLuminescentMoon
it's so small it doesn't need to be the entire entire screen
I love how this is the plot to "The Ring" with Jerma
I don't know what you're talking about, Jeremy. Just a guy
Can't believe it's 6 am in the UK
@Jerma985 What do you think Kim's face on that picture was meant to mean?
this is probably my favorite part of the jerma vids
why did he say no more? what does he intend for tonight
@Jerma985 I bet you can't be serious if you have no experience with any of these
i know you are but i dont think you are
jermaWalk im walking up the stairs and everyone is getting outta there
@Jerma985 please beat it like an amateur, nobody wants to watch it.
@Jerma985 do you think we could do a seaman emote?
you have literally gone to prison and youre going to jail for it @Jerma985
@Jerma985 you need to play a game similar to this game so there will be no problems
we have an official game for a new pc
why is he doing this to himself every time
I've got nothing else to do but watch jerma. I’ll watch the green screen stream next
what if everyone turns out to be bots all along
jerma i love you, you're my favourite streamer and i love your videos :)
I don't even know what the fuck this is OMEGALUL
it didnt sound right, they were talking about the same note
we will need to get the game over now
@Jerma985 the game says you can kill monsters in groups of 10 and kill others and make up your own group
I wonder if anyone is making a porn game that jerma would be great at
This dude can actually take the boss and win
is this the guy who lost to jump king??
This is the game that gave you the ability to eat in 3 days :D
it doesnt work like this in real life Kappa
jermaWalk SoSnowy just a random sneezing snowmourch in my room monkaS
i like jerma as a tuber. he's the best
@jerma985 do you remember that you were gonna play the game today or are you forgetting right now? :)
"it's not that bad" what did they do to you
I'm not a fan of the food either, it's so overly sweet and salty to taste
why does he keep his camera, he has a gambling addiction jermaHeart
jerma should play the nancy drew 2 ost
i cant wait to watch jerma take a dump today
jerma should be in a different casino now
the fact that some people are calling this a penis makes me very uncomfortable lmao
Is there an option to change this to the OST? @Jerma985
@garbQ now you just have to read the message
is joel the one guy who doesnt show up to his own party
what would a stream today be like limesPls
It's my birthday today, can you please sing happy birthday to this family :)
oh yeah we need a JUP STORM, it'll start the next stream!
"imagine not getting a sub and then being a sub
 psycho time
@jerma985 this game actually had a bad ending
I heard Jerma will NEVER play No More Heroes 2
@Jerma985 Did you learn from your mistakes and realize it was a bit boring to watch jermaPluto
it has to be a jerma joke or else we'll all riot
oh boy this is gonna be a good one
I like how this game made him do that
@Jerma985 This is like in every country in the world
why is she running when she doesn't need to
i thought this was a picross game but its a simpsons game jermaFear
The only thing that hurts my eyes when I look out is a giant snake
you guys are like a bunch of kids now jermaPluto
what if she has a foot fetish
@Jerma985 Do the next episode or riot LUL
this makes more sense than the new animal crossing
is this not the game where you throw stuff @Jerma985 ?
just dont give in to us just use jermaSour <3
@Jerma985 is this what you do for a living
@jerma985 you need to have a special key
Why did you put so much time and energy into this LUL
JERMA PLEASE STOP STOOGING. WE CAN'T HAVE A GAME LIKE THIS.
@Jerma985 just play the game normally it's fine
@Tingy the other one is a joke, the one with the snake was the REAL one
they're gonna put Jerma in a gorilla costume
why does twitch want you so bad at their streams ?
you said you want to be the worst gamer on twitch
Is this the guy who lost to pinwheel @Jerma985 ?
@Jerma985 it makes the noise for me and theres a lot of it going on around me!
this is probably the most stressful Jerma's ever played out there
jerma you should play as ster as he's so cool
@Jerma985 did you ever find the good ending
you are a little short of the end
this is like when you go to the store and it makes you feel like you are in a fever dream
he's just saying all this because he has to be late
jerma's face cam, what a gamer man jermaOld
this has just become the stream of the year
you can go to the other side where your health is fucked up LUL
it's a boston house so you gotta have the right angle view
imagine being a chef who wants to be chef
the only thing that's changed is the streamer. i cant tell you anything now
@Jerma985 There were a lot of people complaining about fart jokes
@Jerma985 you need to be aware of where the slime is getting left
is today gonna be the new year or something?
i feel like we are getting really far
It was really good. This might be the only good hulk game.
@Jerma985 You have to wait a week longer Jerma.
@Jerma985 You have no idea how to get into a game
This is a great game I can believe it. Thank you Jerma!!!
im pretty sure that makes me smile every day of my life
i cant believe this is your only stream in the last 40
@Jerma985 You got some hot sauce and hot fries I think
@Jerma985 I went outside and saw one of the carnies in the background who was screaming "LOOG" as I watched and laughed
Why is chat so active today chat? I want to talk with him FeelsBadMan
why did the game have to be so highkey?
what he called the cow 'big dick'
you can say that on the whole stream
@Jerma985 It looks like you've never had a colonoscopy.
@jerma985 you should do a 24 hour stream where you play Nancy Drew jermaIQ
this is the most intense voice acting I've ever heard
@Jerma985 this boss really gets boring after 20 minutes
@Jerma985 Do your best impression of the narrator
you need to find your brother with the keys to the lock
@IamMunkk thanks for the gift sub my ass
I will go and watch a movie now.
@Futurgamr1 you would think a whole week would pass
i know, we all need to chill out to relax to that :) https://clips.twitch.tv/BibleCastyTriumphantCrat
"I like this stream so i cant stop watching, thanks for the amazing stream. Here's to a cool, full video"
this is the hardest thing ive ever cried to
Is this what it’s like to live in this world?
@Jerma985 just use it from my car alarm
Jerma, are you going to play the new
i only played the one guy because he has big feet, so i don't have to follow him
What were the odds that youd win? Did jerma end up beating his meat by himself on stream?
@Jerma985 do not do the last mission, it is a boss fight
@jerma985 is this game worth doing after watching you in an arcade
Jerma can you go to the other side of my screen
it's literally the same as every other game
@bomber_0 It's weird that people still think this is like a weird, generic sim. but that they are so passionate about the sim
@Jerma985 it is really cool that this isn't out yet.
can we please go for the whole stream
you don't have to do this you can just keep changing your name :)
@joshbrin2000 did you get the good one from the same guy
what am i gonna get in for work today
it's a big, big, good movie for the first place
I've been in that car once, it was a blast
Why is an arcade room so expensive OMEGALUL
is jerma not an alien for that? LUL
@Jerma985 This is so hard to understand. What did I just walk in on?
i wish chat could say a few words about this.
just eat them before they kill you jerma
why is this man just taking shots of glass
he sounds like he's about to do something dumb like that
why is jerma only playing the dos games?
what do you think the game is? I'm hungry too.
Jerma I hope your teeth are fine now so you can go explore
you cant make out his nose when you do that
@Jerma985 you should get one of the new game models and textures
This is the worst voice acting ive ever heard
he just goes in and out after taking a few steps. every 10 secs
what happens to chat when you delete channel messages
oh fuck yes I've got this stream on my browser :)
i like how hes doing his best to hide his disgust
This was one of my favorite childhood games
can I just say this is a fucking great game
i have a confession though, the movie night streams are really good
just wait until someone calls jerma LUL is this a prank
Why does this game remind me of the original hit sonic adventure
we cant keep him from having fun with this
can you take a picture of us with this
this movie is a lot like a horror movie
how can it be different, i just joined
jerma is going for a long pee pee
Jerma I’m getting very tired you have to do a bit
"I can't beat the whole thing" -Jerma's chat
i wish my friends and family could have gone with jerma instead of jerma
oh my god that was a good bit
is he the last one at the end of the stream?
that guy just ran over a kid :)
@jerma985 have you ever made yourself a sandwich and put your hands together
You know how all these casinos use that one casino for slot machines?
@Tasty_turd he still has that one dude named "The Thing"
i'm sure its true, jerma is never streaming again
@Jerma985 you don't have to do this shit yourself...
it's the guy who beat pinwheel first try
you never see any of the games i made
i hate how hard he says it its the game youre using to be confused jermaMars
isn't there a game that plays it that plays audio
why cant you make yourself do it like that
@Jerma985 Do "no shit its a bad place"
yeah im gonna play more viva pinata until jerma plays it anyway
@Jerma985 can you do one speed run of this game please? thanks :)
jerma has had the virus before, he should get rid of it
oh damn I thought it was you right there
why don't we have the nappy hat instead
The next character to make a comeback is Jerma
jermaWalk O F E E D jermaWalk
@Jerma985 The game gives you the ability to open packs when you have enough packs.
@Jerma985 You should go see something about the people who have been gone recently
yeah, it just makes it easier to do a bit
if you are good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 Are you doing the old version of Halo Reach?
You get to say "You're not going to play the new game with no input" instead of "You're going to" now
why would you think about jerma as you play a video game are all you ever do is play video games
 believe they can be that easily too, but i love their hard work
if you don't do it on accident you are WRONG LMAO
I have no friends i am going to die :(
darn I have some more games to play I hate them
Is it possible to make me laugh more than I would a real game? :)
@Jerma985 I heard the devs of this game want to return to it, but that is the only reason they do it
@Jerma985 I’m eating raw potatoes i love it
I still know that you had a pretty good job as a substitute teacher. You've been good for a long career <3
He got the entire population down so he can go play minecraft LUL
is it going to be today chat or tomorrow?
"I am so glad that this is a great game." -Ludo the Leech
Jerma is just the one guy in the whole universe that can't actually type at all
I just got here and holy fuck I can't believe it happened that way jermaPluto
its the worst joke because everyone is dead :)
@Jerma985 Are you ever going to stream Kenshi again?
Why does chat keep posting these things LUL
It'd be dope if people were saying "i don't wanna see them!" and "theres a reason why theres no jerma!"
the vinny streams have been a fucking wild rollercoaster after the second channel he made
Jerma you're going on an airplane. You're gonna live on the bus
I wish Jerma would play Simpsons hit and run on stream jermaPluto
I have a very healthy fetish :) but it is not a fetish :)
you need a little bit of money to upgrade your weapons
I can't believe this streamer is streaming RIGHT now
jerma is actually a huge liar and he's going to go to prison for it
Jerma I thought something is up with you today
@CreamCorn31 Thats how I thought at the time
is this the jerma985 vod or an archive LUL
i thought that guy on the right was dead.
This is an interesting game. I hope you enjoy it :D
i can't believe the game is this fun and fun
i had coffee for like 10 minutes straight but you were good
I'm going to call the FDA, they are going to kill me monkaS
@Jerma985 the stream over noise is giving me a heart
@Jerma985 YOU ALREADY DONE A BULLET BANG ON HIS ASS
This looks like one of those scary anime girls
@Jerma985 if you go any closer and have a ballpit near the door, you get a special powerup that lets you have your hands move on the floor LUL
You're probably looking at people from the other side of the room
they dont want all your content im sorry jerma
What happened to a stream of cooking simulator for jerma????
@jerma985 You're not supposed to do this so you can beat me.
what kind of boomer doesnt want to have all these games open so many more tabs
you can't get the first rank in the last game in it's way
just found out I could go to mars for 10 hours jermaPluto
they're gonna fucking throw us out now jermaPluto
you're not the same as a child IRL
i like all types of food for a reason,
can we get a link to that link
I wish I could find jerma.s streams at my pc
can we be friends until he streams and then we can be banned
that's the last you see of them, now on your watch
what the fuck is going on in this town
i was laughing so hard at that
is he actually going to do the vive stream?
you can get some pretty good loot in this game
I dont wanna watch that guy play Kenshi again and it will probably be just him for the next 2 hours
jerma should have a chat filter set if it didnt make it
I've been gone for 2 hours, how late is his stream today?
there's more like a third house than the first LUL
this music is the fucking worst for me.
I used to work for Microsoft and it was a nightmare
but for some reason I can't play them
@Jerma985 they only exist where is it on the map now
that was funny for a second, because i guess jerma is a comedy genius now jermaIQ
@jerma985 hey jerma can you play some halo reach at some point?
dont play that game you won't see it from there, it is a fake game
you're supposed to get a key if you get a key
isn't there like a single thing in the world that is a really good item
I would legit kill someone to get the boots. FeelsBadMan
it's a game a man would play at some point
@Jerma985 you have been playing for over 1 hour right tonight
@Jerma985 This is the worst streamer i've ever seen.
i am really bored, what is this shit
Jerma's brain is making the same noises over and over
is there a stream title on the screen?
how can one man be so wrong :(
theres a 2 in the top right i'm gonna check my pants
He doesn't say anything because his mind is in shambles
jerma has a special twitch app on his phone
the vod is getting to him already OMEGALUL
i'm gonna cry if I sub but I don't care jermaPluto
Jerma your hair looks like its in The Shire
that's some shite jermaSun i bet he didn't see the game
He could beat the game and we wouldn't care
I'm going to drink myself to sleep tonight Jerma
If only you had a better character @Jerma985
I think the AI just wasn't programmed so how long is this game?
why does his face always look so fucked up
i wonder if the AI just isn't programmed
I remember seeing this game in some sort of medical condition
i love malding but i would love if you could stop being malding
JERMA THE DEFAULT FART JOEL CHASES OUT YOUR NAME BETTER
he's not gonna let it go, it's not his fault lmao
this is just like in china and you're never there
can we get an extra hour with this
how much did you pay for it LUL
@Jerma985 how long until you get to do it with another person from the team
@Jerma985 do you think the next emote will be jerma rumble
did the new twitch logo change? like its a new emote :)
@jerma985 are you going to be playing dead rising 2 ?
Is he streaming the first half of the stream?
if you go the other way you'll see the end!
the guy who made that fucking sonic game
its literally made out of wood not paint
you're in a time capsule, remember? @Jerma985 jermaPluto
we get it man, it gets funnier every day jermaPluto
@Jerma985 it's in your best game of all time
I can only imagine the angry and crying chat members when the stream started.
i will do my best to play minecord simps
that sounds like a good idea of your stream @Jerma985
i thought i would be dead as soon as i saw the first one :)
@jerma985 you got your bits in a bit don't start yet
Is your son in chat or something ?
@The_Balla_Koala is it only if you do it once every day?
i'm not even saying that you're wrong but i'm gonna say it
jerma is trying to prove that he can't play a game wrong
@Jerma985 How would you do a speed run
Is this game actually a porn game? I've never been on this level.
@Jerma985 YOU ARE GOING TO BITE YOUR HIGHER GRANDS
This is a fucking game of chess @jerma985
why do all the voices sound like jerma
@Jerma985 have you listened to the music for that one game?
jermaHeart it's okay Jerma, love you for it tony hawk and the rest jermaHeart
He doesn't know the meaning of the word
I wish the internet was as strong as it is :(
@Jerma985 hey when is the next community content night?
he's streaming on the saturday after sunday, and people are dying in there limesPls
It was nice of Jerma to not rush it in :(
I wanna see jerma watch some shitty anime
@Jerma985 You are my favorite streamer because you do great!
hey guys remember in the future when Jerma was 5 years old
i wish jerma would have read this https://i.imgur.com/2zdDHt2.jpg
Jermie's not gonna stream today because he's getting sick rn, hes playing something else tomorrow jermaPluto
Jerma's character looks like a character from Red Dead Redemption 1
is it going to be some day? im not sure
@Jerma985 i have 100,000 channel points and can do only 50 btw :)
You will be lucky to run out of lives if you play the final level :)
did i come into the stream just in time for jerma to say he sucks
@jerma985 you are making me so mad :(
is that the new emote that jerma is playing?
Is this the end of the game or one of them?
You're the first person to use it jermaDafoe
what have you done to the streamer jermaPluto
@N0SoupForU what an idiot, he can use it again later if need be
i dont want to think about how i should be sleeping again jermaPluto
is this that game where the guy gets his hands on a piece of string, and tries to string jump into a hole
you can sell it for as little as 15 bucks
he's not streaming until that point, that's what matters. the rest is you doing something. do stuff you want to do while in town
Is the stream being a bit or not?
it's the little green thing with a hole
I don't know anything about this game, can't say I'm watching a Jerma stream, or anything.
He's gonna get so sick of the music
i didnt know this was a movie stream
@frostyfaucet I think he saw it before he played it, you could be wrong with that
@Jerma985 what is you ever supposed to be
Why would they call it the world's biggest cheese @Jerma985
can i get a jermaJup2 or jermaNosewipe in chat PogChamp
the guy on the right is just standing right where you are
I love how the game has this entire mission in it
I'm sorry I left you hanging you did that
@Jerma985 You can get another item like the one that lets you use your feet
Jerma please stop putting on lipstick, people don't care about your boomer boy
I just joined how much of ameartah
@origion3 That would be the most obnoxious thing I'd do since I live in this area
@Jerma985 I remember when this was the prestream chat
we all know it's gonna get better for him at least
Jerma can't play this on a ps2 game!
@Jacketz nah that shit isnt very common either OMEGALUL
jerma can't say his mom left us for his boomer boy
what the fuck did i just join in on
theres no way jerma is winning this already LUL
I'll watch your stream on friday i guess
@jerma985 You can play all the games on ONE tab
Jerma I'm begging you, give me more time.
imagine going to the beach and then having to get up to make that jump
@Jerma985 are you trying out a new game?
Is that dude who did the dlc naked naked on his pants?
YOU CAN GET THE BOOTS AT THE SAME TIME
I think she means the blue part of the ship
i will just keep watching until im too ashamed
it's like when we were in the tutorial mode
why is this boomer so good at math
I just tried to download it, can you not stream
i wish i could hear the music i just tuned in
it's so good that they're all going fullscreen lol
i wonder if they can get to the very end of this game
this song doesn’t even have the song name right
if you get the boots u can get all 5 endings
jermaWalk DANG IT MEANS JERMA WILL NEVER GET TURNED BACK BY THE BULL
@Kiari13 he was the one who beat it
Jerma is so tall that if we keep going he won't be able to keep the shield in his legs
is this your last run of this level lmao
you have to do it without the sword, not at all
@Jerma985 I'm going to bed now. You better find the next 10 minutes a good time
I just got back from my break and I see that?

@Jerma985 it's slow, you have to do it on a airplane
i can't believe jerma has an actual health bar OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 There's no way you're going to do it
@Jerma985 if you're still on this level you better not make it to the first level
@Jerma985 you can change the same menu I believe
Jerma, you should play viva pinata for the rest of the stream. It's fun and this is fun.
in the game you have to be able to shoot him
@Jerma985 makes you sound like a pro gamer
@Jerma985 You can make one in Dreams, but it's called this
I gotta get the boots this is killing me
@jerma985 you're gonna lose to the other joker
@Jerma985 You can shrink his body down a bit
I like how Jerma doesn't realize that the game is literally the same game without the extras
It's like a car in the middle of the road
A lot of people in this chat have been subbing to Jerma for years
LUL some of the best parts of this game in the last 5
====================
@TrickedByFarming if you know what I mean, you know my house is in the top 5

@KhadBTV No, I think he's just trying to be nice
Did you just come back to the house?
its because all the yam grenades are in the dlc
YOU ARE SO TIRED OF THIS GAME, YOU NEED TO STOP
Jerma is a coward, he doesn't know the stakes
No wonder you have a artist on your team
You made that joke I know you're a real gamer
there's a good deal of work on the side
"this is my first stream" "I'm a REAL gamer"
@Jerma985 this is the most atrocious game ever made
jerma you are the worst streamer you ever made
Jerma why do you always say "why"

Look up what you're looking for
why is there a crack in the floor
@Jerma985 You're gonna be the next Jerma985 for going into the hospital
"I am the hero" - Jerma985, "I am the hero"
@Jerma985 you would be a fool to think that was a joke
I can't get over the fact that cops are in my house
@Jerma985 is it possible to be ascended? I think it's a bunch of things you can do
jerma is more invested in this game than anyone else
"I think we can all agree that you're good at this game"
@Jerma985 you can jump up and down by jumping down
why did he say that, is he trying to be the one guy
A normal man would be a spammer or a clown
Jerma what do you think of this new sonic game?
They sound like they're in a different time zone
@Jerma985 What's the time of the week? I don't think I'm awake LUL

Jerma, how long did it take you to figure out?
I hope they add a lot of emotes for people to use

@Jerma985 i think you're a cool guy

====================
"Can you please go get a grip on that grip?"
@Jerma985 you must have written down when you died
@Jerma985 you can use that to fight the enemy
I don't think your glasses are that good
@jerma985 you will have to redo that, but you can do it on your own
@Jerma985 The only way to win is to play the game you're playing, and you're playing it wrong.
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THE WEAPON
Jerma please play a game called "Fake News" it's so fun and they're making fun of the same joke over and over

There's a lot of stuff you don't see, and you can't see it

A lot of games give you DLCs. I used to get a bunch of money and shit when I was in school and it was pretty cheap. Way too easy to get and it sucks money
I don't get why you're so bad at this level
I think there might be a couple of people in the crowd who just have gone to sleep
I'm going to be honest, this game is kinda hard to watch.
Is this the streamer who beat dark souls 2 on stream?

@Jerma985 The last version of this game looked pretty good
it's not a joke, you're the only one who has to do it
@Jer
====================
A lot of people have actually bought some right now, but they didn't get all the ones you can buy
Cheer250 I'm about to make my first ever joke and it's just to say hi to you quick, if you're good at something never do it for free
if you're not a bot you're using the bot

@Jerma985 You really are of the 50's, we all know what you're talking about
Jerma you've been playing this game for 7 hours
@Jerma985 why is the level in the corner?
@Jerma985 when is the next one on stream?

@Jerma985 look at the side of the rock
@Jerma985 What about the golden cup you gave to your dog?
You're not going to get it until you get to the edge :)
@Jerma985 do you think youre worth it?
I can't believe he's going to keep the eye on the screen forever
@Jerma985 You said you were going to play it as a kid, remember?
@Jerma985 Can you do a clip of the frog as a kid?
I tried to recommend the game to you and you took it too far LUL
jerma, i believe the earth is round and the sun is not

Fucking grillers have to be the hulk in this game
jermaPluto I'm glad I know the answer to that question

this is literally the best thing ive ever seen
It's almost like he's a giant turtle living inside
imagine not being able to drive the car
@Jerma985 The "Why is there a hammer" joke goes too far
how do you guys live without a sub
YEAH, MORE TRICKY, NOT MORE TURNING jermaSun
I remember when Jerma fucked up the upgrade screen
holy shit this is a real life meltdown
@Jerma985 I had an idea for a new stream banner called "Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -2. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points."
Imagine if his face was like this all the time
@Jerma985 What happened to the thing you got?
@Jerma985 you had to change it to a different time
i mean, there is 2 different cities so it'd be really weird if he had to restart a game for some reason
@jerma985 make it on the other side of the game
YOU LEFT THE MONE AND THE OTHER ONE ON THE RIGHT
@Jerma985 You have to wait until after you get the boots to pay them
@BubblesJasmine5280 i have the same idea but it's more complicated
@Jerma985 This game is called The Two Towers.
@Jerma985 why does the man not know that the back door is locked
You can turn this into a game IRL as well
Jerma, if you can do it I will donate $100
i hope there is no one else you can shit on
you're gonna have to make a skeleton of a person to take care of me?
oh no i cant hear my phone

Everyone makes fun of him for being tall jermaPluto

====================

Why are you doing this to yourself? LUL LUL
@Jerma985 these can be a little weird
it's been two days, take your time, son

@Jerma985 your ass is going to get stuck in the toilet
A good bit of fruit is to be lost
Easy mode is cheating on you. It's like you're throwing a brick at a wall.
PogChamp I'M SO FUCKING GLAD YOU ARE TRYING
@Jerma985 There's a telling thing you don't want to do
jerma can you stop talking its fucking annoying
jermaWalk when the giant enemy spider shows up

@Jerma985 wash the toilet before you start the stream
Turn off the stream and go to bed
its been so long since I played this game
@Jerma985 you need to do a bit more damage
i stopped watching at like 3 AM to get my mitts on this game and now im stuck in bed for like 30 hours

@jerma985 if you didnt have hella money you probably wouldn't have decided to stream at all
@Jerma985 you skipped the middle one and have to claim a new one
@Jerma985 have you considered the fact that you're actually a poopoo?

====================
Chibi Robo Keeps Your Health And Cooking Hands!
@Jerma985 The first one in the game is the "Some guy's name?"
@Jerma985 You still have a game for the gamecube
Do you have a car on the drive thru? I'm curious
This is the dark souls of building a fort
@Jerma985 You can make a huge castle just outside the normal town
this is what the colonoscopy machine sounds like
I'm not sure what it is wrong with you.
I just joined what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 if you die you have to make more money
@Jerma985 the only good thing about this game is the sound effects
@Jerma985 if ur health is above 50% you will get hit by a car
that was a jup storm and you guys needed to go to the hospital
what if you're not going to be able to beat this game
so what's the worst hobby you've ever had?
@Jerma985 The one with the sword, that one's a hero
@Jerma985 why is your character so bad at cooking?
Boomer is bad but not for the game
@Jerma985 you should just run out of time to do stuff
you're gonna give up in like 1 hour
I bet a lot of people are watching jerma and not you
So is this a game about the connections between people or something?

He's not even as bad as "I'm a big fan of the first game" LUL
@Jerma985 it's a good game but it's not as fun as the original story
the joke was made of a joke chat
I just got here, why is this guy here?
@Jerma985 I made a board and I need your help
I'm working on a jerma clip for my vods
@Jerma985 have you ever watched a video of a car
if you don't like pinapple, you don't like sourdough
@Jerma985 Could you give us a link when you stream again?
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE BUFFS THAT'S IN THE MORNING
It's a dink and drop location! We need another one
i just got here, why is there a hotdog in the middle of a crowd
I can't believe Jerma's been playing this for 8 hours
jerma, you never just go to the bathroom jermaPluto
I remember when I was a kid
my grandma would have been a lot cooler to have kids than me
jerma, why are you still playing this? LUL
it seems the only reason they are here is to get in
the CPU game is one of the funniest games I've ever seen
you can just walk away from the phone and the garage door will open
you're still in the first level? :) it's not a good idea
@Jerma985 do you remember the theme from last night? @Jerma985
this is good, i cant wait to see this guy play this game in real time
I wonder if Jerma will actually play the demo version of this game
OPEN THE COLD WATER TANK AND TEACH YOU HOW IT WORKS
@Jerma985 this game is just the tutorial, nothing is you're doing
@Jerma985 You can set that up on the main menu
I wish jerma would play this game tonight
i have a huge scrotal strain from my neck
@Jerma985 you get your feet on the bed
Getting dragged into the meat grinder will get you in trouble
do you want to be buried in the walls?
JERMA IS IN
====================
The size of my birdhouse
This is a lot for a gamecube game
Yeah, there's a good reason for that, watching the games on that is so hard
i dont think you can get a leg up
@astral_tellurian that was the best joke of the decade
@Jerma985 imagine feeling like a toddler after being told to stop being a kid
i'm not even sure how to play this game
@Jerma985 You're too short to read the buttons
@Jerma985 We need three different emotes so you can be the one who can make the most money
it's like a reverse-chrono trigger where you can block telegraphed arrows
I can't believe Jerma is a cheater! Please help, I'm in debt.
the hulk looks like hes in the bathroom
Jerma, why are you still playing this game? @Jerma985
@Jerma985 can you play the level on Stream without the sound
why is there a side bar on the bottom of the screen
@Jerma985 Do you have a plan for when you get to the rest of the level?
Guys he was too busy wiping his mouth
@jerma985 can you put my broken drink in the sink?
@Jerma985 can you please play another game? I want to go to the dentist
@Jerma985 you just put the snow on the snow
@Jerma985 why does this guy sound like someone in a movie
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU DO BUT IM HERE TO MAKE YOU FEEL
Cheer250 The part during the movie where you say "that ending" in your voice was one of my favorite moments in the entire movie. Thank you for all the laughs and said, "this is the end of the movie, I can't do that again"
is this the streamer who spent time on mr rump?
Kappa this is just the sound of a fucking cariren
You can skip the dialogue if you do 100% of the dialogue
I think you should be careful, his dialogue is so bad
Jerma can you pause for a minute, i need to pee
You have to start over or the boss will come back
@Jerma985 theres a secret behind the door to the left
theres a secret behind the door to the left of the door

====================
Thanks for the gift sub! <3 <3
Just got back. What did you do to him?
@Jerma985 You can get some in the new room
go to the bathroom and pee in the toilet
@Fidofidder i don't think we're supposed to see this
you can only have one hair, the other is the other
It's like the amount of points for a joke @Jerma985
why is the guy in the bottom left just tilting his head and not the front?
I was interested in the stream title but I'm not sure
@Jerma985 there's a way to turn off the auto tune in your car.
@Jerma985 There's a single instance of you doing this to yourself
@Jerma985 I think you got a serious disease
I'm gonna need a new toothbrush, I don't want it to be like this
@Jerma985 if you just want to eat a shoe/bowl I don't know if you'll be able to
@Jerma985 What's your opinion on the other 30%?
@Jerma985 Have you ever seen a TV show with a TV-Guesser ?
@Jerma985 You should know it's not a secret. The real Jerma is a few years older than you.
@Jerma985 you need to go to the smaller town
I don't think he smells like a tree
@Jerma985 i think it is just your "bunch"
@Jerma985 You have to invest in a real estate asset
you have to do the boss room
yeah it was good to do it in the first place
@Jerma985 It's like the movie poster in that episode
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this????
@Jerma985 Will you be doing the TOS commercials when the stream starts?
@Jerma985 Make a roach egg with the turtle shell

I wish this was a horror game LUL
@x0urania can you tell us the name of the song?

@Jerma985 you can turn off the autopilot if you're in slow mode, or you can just turn it back on
why do people
====================
Cheer100 I know you're playing this game. But what did you do to get mad at it?
@Jerma985 theres a lot of horses in this town
@Jerma985 Can you play it on the Gamecube?
theres a story mode that happened to me, why do we hate each other?
@Jerma985 I just got here, so it's the scariest thing I've seen
everything is good in the vacuum of time, it's just that it's always been bad
I'm gonna go get some soup just in case it gets cold jermaPluto
@Jerma985 no wonder you got back on the horse
I'm joking, I'm the only person in the world that doesn't have a crush on someone
Killed her like 2 times in a row
If you're a kid I think you're the best
it's a weird way to say it LUL
@Jerma985 You have a level 5 form in it
@Jerma985 This is a joke, I'm trying to watch a movie
I like how Jerma only plays Katamari and doesn't show any gameplay.
I'm glad you didn't bring a titty for me
now that viva pinata has its name, i'm glad i won't be old again
YOU CAN FEEL THE FEET FROM YOUR PILLOW
You gotta go to the next room first, you can't go in the next room.
@IamMunkk well i just watched your stream, which means you make a good joke
@Jerma985 You can't get rid of the fish

I'm so happy to see you doing something so wrong, I always find it a bit awkward
jermaOld Can I get a refund on my sub?

@jerma985 The process of adding an extra frame is not a good experience
do you think he will be able to play the game?
this is a really nice album, i hope you enjoy it too
you need to find the last ones right @Jerma985
@Jerma985 Wait, did he say he'd be playing the new Hitman?

why is everyone talking about your hair LUL
Hey @Jerma985 I've been watching you since 2012. I once just got gifted a sub! What should I do?

Jerma's back, he was here when you got stuck
ANOTHER NANCY DREW STREAM PogChamp Clap
jerma you're gonna get addicted to the weed you smoke
I want to see the car crash again jermaPluto
He just needs to find the first one
i just got here and this is the first thing I see
@Jerma985 Watch Jerma's first and last video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCn7YQ1E5v0
You can't just be a boomer and say "universe"
@jerma985 you look like a chicken from twin towers
jermaPop Should I put on a little pout and pop JermaPop, or should I put on the pout and pop emote?
I'm not sure if this is actually a good idea or not
jerma's mom is a bank robber and she wants your money
just wait for him to get to the secret level
i like how he just starts the game with the boomer screen
This is just what you did to that bear
JERMA WHAT'S THAT SHIT IN YOUR PANTS YOU'RE TELEPORTING

@Jerma985 I got a really nice combo with the mushroom!
@Jerma985 you shouldnt have done the hat

HE'S PLAYING THIS GAME AS A MASTER FINISH
@Jerma985 have you played the other leg of the game?
This is the worst stream I've seen this year, chat.
I mean, it's the most accurate one.
if you die in this game you die in real life
is he gonna play other games with you?
it's a lie, this is the origin of the game lol
It's like they are both watching the end of the game
@Jerma985 you have to have the correct opinion
i'm not gonna lie, i'm trying to watch jerma vids
@Jerma985 You're gonna lose it when you

Old gamers are being forced to spend money on virtual currency. It's so absurd.
@Jerma985 You just need to delete the old save
@Jerma985 please have a real time timeout for the facecam
@Jerma985 when are you gonna play the Frog Detective Adventures?
@Jerma985 please go back to kenshi. its not that hard
jerma you're too much of a gamer boomer to understand
i like how you're the one pointing the controller at them
jerma is the only person here who doesn't know what a diaper is
hes born into the wrong age group jermaOld
There is a giant hamster in the middle of the ocean
I cant believe Jerma985 is actually a gamer
@Jerma985 why do you have to fucking click on the mouse
@Jerma985 Mods can't be real unless they make a video.
Jerma's getting the upper hand of the king.
jermaDisgust just watching the streamer who lost to pinwheel OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 you were right the stream is over

You're just gonna have to heal him back to him

@Jerma985 i think its cause of the game, they can't do anything with you
@Jerma985 How does it feel to be a furry

The last time you laughed was the fucking funny
I'm waiting to be a part of Jerma's life
I'm glad the guys with the big budget can afford it
is this a streamer or is he a real person?
@Jerma985 When you say "7:23" you literally are just saying "7:24"
I think you're doing a great job and it really makes you feel good!
@Jerma985 Do you like to eat ass? jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 i tried to make a pog post about you but i just got mald and had to go to work
@Jerma985 You can actually get the heart by doing the bingo
@jerma985 You should have a room like this in the bottom left, it will be cool

TASTE OF THE HOLY BONES PAST THE POG AT THE END
I guarantee Jerma will never come back to the corona virus
@Jerma985 The cheats in this game are pretty easy
how can you not like it? it's got candy
@Jerma985 you gotta be a professional chef to cook
@Jerma985 Jerma I'm not sure this is what you're supposed to do
I think it's better to just delay them so they don't get to see their jokes
@Jerma985 the sound effects are coming from above you
yeah its gonna be hard to come by
you can't get new characters because they are already unlocked
jerma im gonna be honest this game is in a mood for the next mission

@Jerma985 How much do you pay for a phone line
Is this the streamer who beat Doctor Mario FIRST TRY?
@Jerma985 use the blue portal to enter the sea
@Jerma985 You can add another water feature to the game
Jerma the fish is in the water, it's not being drowned by a tank
@Jerma985 Do you have a bathtub in your bathroom?
theres a lot of stuff in this game
@NoNameJerma Why the fuck would anyone just make a shitty game and play it as a kids game?
I would love a Jerma stream. I can't wait to see him play this game on stream
You can get the kids back if you see a scooby doo in the back
could you please turn on the music please :)
You need to have the chance to kill the boss
I don't think that's even how it works
@Jerma985 You ARE the clown everyone loves you
I would do it for a little bit
what about "shaming the other" and "forcing us to have fun"?
that's what he said at the end of the stream
What if you're doing a stream and the streamer is just saying, "Oh yeah" and then just follow them like you're following
I've gone to the doctor, the picture is not normal
@Jerma985 Do you also eat cereal and shit
Why does the AI make all the jokes for you

jerma you were doing a good job. congrats on the stream!
I just got here. Is this the streamer who beat Dark Souls 2 on stream?
i think the pot is in the pot LUL
@Jerma985 You should play a game called Vikar's Land
Funny thing is, Jeremy's gonna have to play the game tomorrow
You have to turn off the stream to get the "chat is slow" message you just sent to them.
@Jerma985 if you want to talk, just go to the last few screens
@Jerma985 is this the same streamers that beat chivalry on stream?
Let's put the facecam on this is a cool and different song
that's the thing about jerma, you have to take a look at his face
@Jerma985 are you playing any Halo games?
the messages in vinny's chat were terrifying

I'm watching all of Jermas streams and he's doing this to me to play like an hour or two
this is the best song in the game

you have to pay for the game just to get the job
@Jerma985 You need to hit the blank button to move
@Jerma985 I think the wrong game is called Sam and Max

this is the worst way to go about
====================
you're wrong. they can't get past the first boss @Jerma985
@Jerma985 The first thing you do when you get a new house is find the ladder you used to climb it and use it to escape
You can use it to open the door @Jerma985

@Jerma985 do you like a slushie like a girl?
@Jerma985 Do you live like a fucking scientist

@Jerma985 DON'T READ MY SUB BUT I WILL NOW
I liked when he said he looked at chat and said "look at me"
this is the kind of game where the sound effects are just half the game.
I think you should be put in a different VR
@Jerma985 wait I have no idea what this is?
@Jerma985 you don't have a single fiber connection

I'm gonna be honest, I don't give a shit
@Jerma985 I DONT KNOW WHAT A WATER PIPE IS
This is a joke, I am going to have nightmares.
chat is fine, i have a new boy
i feel like this is the game where the only reason to get a new game is to play it twice
To be fair, the reference looks like a generic character from a jerma magazine
@Jerma985 is this the new timezone? for the mods?
Jerma only plays games on the switch LUL
what do you get when you have a furry fursona
i want to see a movie night jermaVenus

jerma missed the last 7h of the stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you still don't have a Xbox? So you're just not using it.

@Jerma985 It's a surprise. You have to try it. If it's not what you expected, you're wrong

PlasmaPlasma They're really cute, they're just making you feel like its your own fault
@Jerma985 can you make a clown park in this game?
WHY IS THE CHAT STILL TRACKING MY POINTS
@Jerma985 please stop using a "jermaOtto" emote, this emote is too powerful
you can get in the middle of the road if you're not careful
@Jerma985 how long has this game been going on for?
Jerma can you stop with the Hit and Run jokes now?
@jerma985 you can't even keep the first one out

@Jerma985 We're not gonna beat this for you
dude i can't even type "jerma" in my mouth
you're going to make me feel a lot better
@Jerma985 The secret is you need to use the passage tool to progress
It's not the game, it's him doing the voice over
@Jerma985 you can't just turn on another monitor
It's a good job Jeremy, you have been here for 2 hours
what are the chances that we'll ever get a Jerma stream?
@Jerma985 they even made a game about this in the Labo streams

@Jerma985 you're not gonna get it on time
@Jerma985 this is the only one I've seen that was good

@Jerma985 oh I'm sorry i was the one who said that
@Jerma985 what if you want someone to smell your pee?

@Jerma985 The FIRST DOCK, NEXT to the pirated version, has the next DLC in it
Jerma you can bait people to buy you better internet
Why is there a voice changer on screen
@Jerma985 You know as long as you don't mess it up, you'll get it
this is the most boring thing I've seen
@Jerma985 I wanna see the rest of the game
I want you to get rid of the coin so we can get some more coins

@Jerma985 make a tube of water and make it into a gourd
i liked the first part of this game :)
people were just spamming it like it was some kind of meme
@Jerma985 The new Dark Souls looks better than this one
why does it sound like this game is boring?
That image is a fake one, the real one
He might be a little too far into the game
@Jerma985 you can easily obliterate that one guy's radar
@Jerma985 Have you heard of the Chuck E Cheese pizza?
i'm glad i have the time to be a good boy
Jerma is going to be late again, and I'm sorry

M E G A T H E P
@Jerma985 look at the dogs feet to see how you can keep them safe
sounds like youre trying to make a profit
@Jerma985 This is the best idea you did
this game looks like it's made for people with dementia
@Jerma985 You can do the paperclip level, Jerma
Okay, so you are running out of money
this is the best music video of the decade
@Jerma985 will you ever play another of my favorite games? @Jerma985
@Jerma985 the jerma era has passed, it's time to move on
@Jerma985 file the video on your computer, it's a video sharing website that feeds your internet!
@Jerma985 You can get the ring by the statue and the dragon, if you're in the costume

I love how you have to give her more money than you need and it's like "oh sure, I gave you money, guess what? I'm not gonna give you money"
I'd rather watch the irl stream then watch the gameplay
@Jerma985 are you a baby or something too
@Jerma985 have you heard of joe rogan's new game from the devil?
Do not end the stream. I am in a coma
@Jerma985 i think this is gonna be a full speed run LUL
How the hell did you even get there
most of the emotes are going to come from an actual bit donation
@Jerma985 Make a video of you in the bathtub
I don't even know who this is very angry about PepeHands
you can play as the jugs by yourself
imagine if jerma had a slot machine with a toilet to go to
You can get stabbed in the stomach if you put the oil on it
I think the book will be good, if you do it right
@Jerma985 there are no more heroes 2 on the switch
@Jerma985 why do the two of them sound the same
jerma you are a big fan of the game
That is the best thing I've seen in a while
if you get shot by a sniper, you are going to die :)
why is this buzzing bee in my kitchen?
The wizard is the guardian of sus
@Jerma985 there's a crazy person in the room
i just watched the vod and the guy was talking about how it's been 11 years
I just got here, how the heck is the stream

I can't believe our favorite streamer fucking died to Pinwheel jermaPluto
I'm not gonna ban you for a SECOND, you're a good streamer and I'm gonna be here to witness it
WE CAN SEE FROM THE TUBE IN YOUR WINDOW
oh, the serial killer from dark souls?
i like when jerma plays as a hermit
jerma is losing his mind at this point
@Jerma985 you need to open the door in the ship
@Jerma985 i think you should just make a nice jup for every single one of the asshole characters
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -119. Use +2 or -
====================
After you beat the first level you can skip to the next next
@Jerma985 You should take the trash bag full of food and put it in your humidifier
jermaWalk Idk why but I think it would make it easier
jerma, I'm calling it now, the only streamer who doesn't suck dick is the guy who only streams for 4 hours straight
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -12. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
why are you trying to get your dick hit by the car
I mean its a bird and its only a small bird
@Jerma985 I have a next-gen copy of this game and I have to install it and play it
@Jerma985 I'm scared. I know you gotta have a safe word

why do you need to have all the boxes
Yeah this stream is gonna get a lot of hate.
@Jerma985 you can get the new level from the rift
jermaSuperFrog I just got back, did he beat the last level?
This man is literally going to grow up to become a vr streamer
@Jerma985 You have to be in the right spot
You can hit the stone, it gives you a extra attack!
Jerma you should do the thing where you just do this for yourself
chat is already slowly getting bored of this game
You can't just play this the original game
you had to go to the bathroom to get your drink jerma
I dont think they even had the same name
I'm gonna fuckin die and go to heaven
jesus christ, were you a mod in another game? @Jerma985
I think this is the first time it's revealed that Jerma is a two-faced 3 year old
he's gonna be late, he's gonna be late
i need to get off the phone just to let you know
@Jerma985 first time you play this, you were the one who said it was a great game
@Jerma985 you can buy a few extra copies for the price of
====================

A man died of old age at the age of 79
It's like he's an asshole, but in a way
I’ll give you 100 dollars if you play for a while
they got a trailer for the new tv show
@Jerma985 I'm a dentist and I know what you mean!
@Jerma985 it's a good game, but you have to go through the tutorial
jerma you have to stop the gun from shooting you
I thought it was a joke for a second
I've been here for 2 hours and I can't believe you're still here. I can't believe you're still here
Jerma's gonna get a nice warm bath tomorrow @Jerma985
@Jerma985 It's a pretty good idea to make a custom level that can be uploaded to a channel that has a lot of bots
You've been in the sewer for like 20 minutes
I don't think I've ever heard someone say that.
@Jerma985 you have to turn off the mic
I don't know, I can't remember the last time I played this
@Jerma985 do you have a backpack on the ground
jerma is such a cheater, he doesnt even know what a bag is
we need a jerma emote for a jerma stream
I think he'll be fine to play it.
i wish i had a jerma vid, but i dont have a jerma vid
is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
they said the other one was the one you just said
@Jerma985 you've been doing this for 2 hours, it's not a joke
@Jerma985 It's a good game, but you have to go through the tutorial
@Jerma985 you can get the key by picking it up.
JERMA NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT IN THE GAME
you can't go to the secret room when the cops are here
There are a lot of good games on Steam
HEY, IS THIS THE STREAMER WHO BEAT DARK SOULS ON STREAM??
Jerma needs to see the full movie now
you can tell how mad he is because he's a little too small

Boomer is the only one that can do it
@Jerma985 You can put a goldfish in the water for free

I think the 2nd row is the one that gets the most points

you're gonna get stuck in the water with the fish
@Jerma985 You can't just go back to the beginning
That's what happens when you're not around for the game.

@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
This is a pretty good game. The music is amazing, and the story is really good.

@Jerma985 you can click the map to the left
@Jerma985 you're not a furry, you're a child
@Jerma985 if you die to pinwheel you die to pinwheel
@Jerma985 how do you feel about being a furry?
HES GONNA DIE TO PINWHEEL BUT NOT PINWHEEL
can you put the facecam in the bottom right corner?
@Jerma985 What if you just got a katana sword and never used it
why is the guy on the left? is he a robot?
@Jerma985 You can go to the back of the castle
Jerma if you could never be born again, what would you do?
If you dont have a dad, I'm not gonna give you that shit
It's like a dog that's been sitting in a crate for over a week.
@Jerma985 are you going to play the new Monster Rancher 2?
@Jerma985 Are you gonna be streaming in like 2 hours?
it's not a real game, it's a baby game
@Jerma985 I'm going to the toilet and I'm gonna eat my own ass
You can't even say the same thing over and over
@Jerma985 you can put the coins in the garage
@Jerma985 I'd be happy to have a chat in the discord channel
he's not even at the start of the game
@Jerma985 I'm gonna ask you a question, what's the best ending for this game?
@Jerma985 What did you think of the new Vegas theme?
@Jerma985 do you think you can beat this game in 30 seconds?
@Jerma985 Can you stream for 2 hours? I need to watch the VOD
@Jerma985 you need to make a bigger house for the giant rat
@Jerma985 There's a guy that's in the stream and he's just too busy killing them to do it anymore
@Jerma985 they are going to get attacked by the more powerful monsters
@Jerma985 Have you ever seen someone eat a shoe and then eat it in an hour?
@Jerma985 the tutorial is just this entire game
@Jerma985 it's a game about the dangers of high risk, not a game about the dangers of playing safe
I’ll be honest, I don't really know what I'd be playing if it wasn't for the sounds and the music.
HOLY SHIT THE FUCK IS THIS MADE IN JERMA
imagine being this bad at a game LUL
@Jerma985 you can hit the shield and the knight will instantly kill them
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to leave the level to get a new one
@Jerma985 I'm going to watch the VOD soon. Please start the stream.
@Jerma985 It's the 4th phase of the game
@Jerma985 THE DUNGEON IS A SUPERHERO BUT NOT A BOOB
@Jerma985 you could've just just grabbed the other ones
you gotta go to the next one you can't get there
@Jerma985 You need to kill the hulk so he can get more money
just like how i drink alcohol without the alcohol
@Jer
====================
the only way is to have the LUL of a comedian
I think they're not as good as they used to be
I can't believe you're playing this for the first time
you need to do this mission to unlock a new character
@Jerma985 When will the next stream be? I miss the last time I came here
Why is there a bat in the top left?
I can't believe Jerma got a free sub and he can't even use it
Why does Jerma think he has a 2 day old in his basement
@Jerma985 the joke is that you'll get a gift sub
@Jerma985 the vroomer is the most powerful weapon in this game
this is what you call an artist, they're all gonna get taken advantage of
@Jerma985 what is the plan for this game?
you have to be a doctor to do this
@Jerma985 If you die in the game you die in real life
@Jerma985 That is a shame. You should know the difference
I swear to god if you're not happy I'll be begging you to stop streaming
@Jerma985 you have to pay for the mule
@Jerma985 You're a loser, you're not a gamer
i thought you were supposed to go to the doctor
You have to do the jump to the bridge
this is what happens when you don't drink enough water
this is a game where the title means nothing
It's a lot less fun than the first game
I hate when you can't get it on the switch
It's a good game, I just don't get it
@Jerma985 you can do a little bit of that
Jerma is the only person on twitch that actually knows how to read LUL
There's a mod for this game that has been in development for like 5 years
Jerma how do you like the new meme?
@Jerma985 that's not true, you can't say that in the discord chat.
youre a boomer and the internet is bad
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting in 1 hour and 5 minutes, but he may be up to an hour EARLY!
Jerma please, I need to watch some Joel streams :)
jerma why do you have a porn folder in your twitch chat?
i cant believe i've seen a streamer die to a house flipper
@Jerma985 You need to tell him to do it
why is it so quiet? i love this game
I love how Jerma just repeats his lines
@Jerma985 It's like the game is trying to tell you the exact time it was born.
this is like watching a child play with the ball
@Jerma985 can you pause the game for a bit
@Jerma985 I want to see you do the whole game
you can do a little bit of that
i can't believe jerma is getting addicted to drugs
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
You have to be a doctor to do this
@Jerma985 It's a great game, it's just not that fun to watch
@Jerma985 you can always get a lot of money from that
I'm so happy that Jerma is having a fun time
Dont say that, I'll be dead if you do it
that's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
@Jerma985 The game's not designed to be fun, and it's not fun
jermaSun i cant believe it's been 2 years
i think this guy is a virgin now
@Jerma985 When are you going to play the Contra Hard Corps game?
@Jerma985 you can change the "hey" to "I'm not a gamer"
he's gonna be the one doing the final boss
what the fuck did i just come into
@Jerma985 the first thing you do is to get the fuck out of the water
i wonder if this is an early 2000's game
yeah its the same thing as the first game
@Jerma985 you have to do this in the chat
I would have done that if I could
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -176. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i think i saw a guy on the internet
jermaOld Back in my day we didn't need to get our coffee.
jermaOld back in my day, we used to have a lot of snow in the winter
there was a bug in the basement that ate the shit out of my pants
I love how Jerma just repeats his lines without changing them
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR YEARS
he's got like a few vrooms, like a little bathtub
i think the game just makes you do stuff and stuff
he
====================
I'm just watching a horror movie and I'm not a fan of the game
@Jerma985 what are you supposed to do?
Did he actually beat the game? He had to save it
@Jerma985 You're gonna get stuck on the last boss, remember?
@Jerma985 i had a dream about you and you and me :)
@Jerma985 are you going to play the one where you give jerma a cup of tea?
jerma is still going to be stuck in this room
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
you have to beat the boss to get to the next level
@Jerma985 Have you ever tried the "Have you ever tried the " "Punch" joke
@Jerma985 you can drag the bottom left of the screen, and press the triangle button to cycle through them
@Jerma985 the guy who made the original drew crew is on your team
@Jerma985 you should turn the music down to 90% and put it in a different tune
He's gonna get stuck on the last boss
@Jerma985 You can't just use the elevator to go to the other one
@Jerma985 You're gonna have to beat the game
no one is going to see this message
Jerma why do you think people think you are a bad person
That's a lot of money, dude. That's a lot of money
@Jerma985 why are you using a baby diaper LUL
Theres a huge hole in the middle of the screen
how many times has he been in this dungeon
jerma you should do a full playthrough of this game
you'll get timed out for not getting the key
This guy just posted a picture of him on twitter
jermaPluto i'm gonna get out of here and go to sleep
jerma is a dumbass who doesn't know what a joke is
this is the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 You can only do it on the outside of the house
@Jerma985 you can't run in the open with a spear
@Jerma985 You can't get your house from the other side
@Jerma985 When you're old you'll be able to get a better gun.
@Jerma985 they're in a really bad spot
@Jerma985 I feel like you're going to die if you put the wrong things in
Jerma you need to be able to follow the arrows
@Jerma985 can you do the "I'm not your mom" joke again?
@Jerma985 what if the game is just a video game
@Jerma985 the game has a video game overlay on top
jermaWalk DREW CREW IS HERE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE WORLD jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you need to make your own tiny house to make money
JERMA IS IN A CHAIR IN THE BATHROOM

@Jerma985 do a full playthrough of this game
@Jerma985 you need to do it in the dark
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's been a fun time.
The way you use the sword is good for a few reasons.
@Jerma985 you have to hit the B button
@Jerma985 do you have a job, or is it just a job?
Jerma, I got a new laptop and it's a little louder than you
@Jerma985 you got a dog in the fridge
jermaOld I'm a plumber, I can't even fix the screen.

do you think the stream is going to be like this?
@Jerma985 go to the next area and wait for the stairs
@Jerma985 You have to get to the town first
@Jerma985 You should've kept the eye open and been able to see through the fog, it's an important part of the story
@Jerma985 it's not the best, but it's better than the other one
@Jerma985 you can't turn it off if you don't have a key
@Jerma985 get in the car and drive around the park
jermaOtto if you don't get the key you have to kill him
Hey Jerma, what's the best way to get out of this game?
i had to do a math test in college
jermaHeart Please don't let this guy die jermaHeart
@Jerma985 you need to learn how to make your own food
why are you still playing this game?
@Jerma985 Can we get some JermaOneguy in chat?
I have a weird feeling that you have no idea what you're doing
JERMA YOU NEED TO PLAY MORE DUNGEON 2
jerma is not even a nice person anymore
you're gonna need a whole other quest to get a new one
@Jerma985 can you tell me what the hell is going on?
I just got here, is the stream over?
can we get a jermaWalk emote please? 🤔
This is how you look at your own face
i thought you were gonna call me a boomer
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get the boots because of this, you'll never get the boots
jermaPop jermaOld jermaPop jermaOld jermaPop jermaOld jermaOld jermaPop
if you do this stream i will be in the hospital
If you don't finish the game it's too late
I'm glad you're playing this game, it's great
theres a joke you can make that will actually turn into a porn game
@Jerma985 you need to get the safe and get the food
@Jerma985 You need to kill the guy that was standing in front of you
It's not even funny, it's just a lie jermaDisgust
i've got a bag of glue in my pocket
the level design is way better than the game design
I thought he was gonna play it tomorrow
Oh my god, is this the streamer who beat Sam and Max ON STREAM??
@Jerma985 the gimli is the only person that i know
why is everyone asking for your emote
I'm not a fan of this game and I think you're bad
jermaOtto i want to go home and watch the vod
@Jerma985 have you ever heard of "swiss cheese"?
@Jerma985 "Why don't you just sell it to a bank?"
@Jerma985 It's not a bad idea, it's just that the taste is still too strong
@Jerma985 I mean, I got my iPhone 6s from a friend who's a big fan of mine, but it's not my phone.
i cant wait for the stream to end
@Jerma985 the water level is just a lie
you can shoot the dog with the bow
@Jerma985 I've heard that there's a time limit to it
====================
the only good thing about this game is that it has a LOT of shit to do, so it is pretty cool
Why is he just playing this game on his ps4?
i thought you were playing a game called "brick by brick"
You can change the game to your liking now :)
Jerma you're the only person on this team who makes the rules :)
It's like a massive spider walking around the screen
i thought you were gonna say "the pizza"
I think he's just a giant rat with a huge brain
This is the worst stream of 2020 Jerma
i just got here what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 You've been playing this game for 2 hours straight
what does the best movie on youtube have to do with this
you can't hold a fucking controller like that
You gotta go back to the beginning of the level
The old man is back to the drawing board
You can use the memory card to save up for the next round
you are gonna get a giant spider
jermaPluto i dont even know what is happening
the 1st one is the most realistic one
@Jerma985 You could have gone for the worse one.
@Jerma985 you should play the game "subliminal messages" for the first time
That's a good thing you can get in the alley, I think it might be better if you just walk around and look for it
@Jerma985 if you don't think the boss is bad, just play the game
@Jerma985 the name of the game is the black box game
@Jerma985 I made a video for you. Please do it
@Jerma985 your face is too small for the camera
the next level is what we call a dream
I'm going to the bathroom, can I get some ice cream?
@Jerma985 Are you the guy who lost to pinwheel?
@Jerma985 Don't let that man talk about the cow
@Jerma985 are you going to play sekiro for the next 12 hours?
Jerma is a vampire, he has a heart attack and dies
@Jerma985 how do you know how to make a chocolate bar?
@Jerma985 You need to play a different game and try to find the answer
Hey @Jerma985 this is the guy who beat dark souls on stream, he doesn't have a vive
I would never put my phone in the microwave
jermaWalk I HAVENT SEEN A jermaWalk IN MY LIFE
@Jerma985 you can click on a message to see it
@Jerma985 what if we kissed in the dark
If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 You should use the powerstone on the wall to stop him
this is the worst stream of 2020 jerma
@Jerma985 You can get a free gamecube gamecube controller if you just play it on your pc
The only thing that makes me happy is watching jerma play a game that is so bad it's just a short cutscene
@Jerma985 Make sure you have your camera ready
@Jerma985 what happened to the other 3?
@Jerma985 I dont think you should have been in the bathroom
@Jerma985 you have to have an "I'm the one who made it" emote in the game
you guys are going to get your ass kicked
@Jerma985 You should make a custom character with a hair jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 Your face is too small for the camera
@Jerma985 Just send a message to the chat, and chat will be fine.
jerma if you don't get a slime you have to go back to the beginning
oh, you can't say that about a real gamer
this is the only game that's not a minecraft server
@Jerma985 can you play the whole game for me?
just let him play some music while you're gone
@Jerma985 you can make a saddle with them
i hope the stream starts right now :)
@Jerma985 can you please turn the game off please
If you don't want to do it, just don't do it
@Jerma985 If you can do it, just do it
@Jerma985 You can't just eat a shoe, you have to eat it
@Jerma985 you are now in violation of the show
Chat has Bashed 499 Seagulls, use !bash to help
@Jerma985 I think you need to have a new character to beat this boss
@Jerma985 you can't have a cheatsave to the table
@Jerma985 can we get a new emote? :)
I just realized that I didn't see the link in the background
I thought you were going to play this for a bit

====================
The screen is gonna be a whole lot of different colors
@Jerma985 It's not the final boss. You can just destroy him
I have no idea what's going on but I do know it's a good stream
JERMA YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME FOR FREE
@Jerma985 do you have any plans to play other games this year?
I'm sorry if you didn't see the video, but the game is already out
@Jerma985 You're a funny boy, you know that
@Jerma985 you can use the other item to steal from the merchant
what are you guys doing in this game? @Jerma985
Jerma is a complete piece of shit, he's just a cool boy
@Jerma985 There's a video on the website about this, you should check it out
i have a bunch of stuff i want to do but im not sure
they're not getting their shit together they're just making it up
It's hard to tell who's talking to the streamer
you can't even get a boost if you're not in the game LUL
the first time I saw the movie was at the beginning of the movie
did he ever say when he was gonna do a vr commentary stream?
If you had a wife and kids, would you ever do it?
I can't believe Jerma's still streaming this game.
@Jerma985 This is the first video you've streamed since the last VOD
I was gonna say something about this guy
jermaVenus when you're actually in the middle of a fight
@Jerma985 The only way to beat this game is to take it down!
the last time you went to the bathroom and he went "I'm going to pee"
I'm not gonna go to sleep until you get to the green screen
its like theres a third world country where the reds are all the way in the sky
i was just about to say that it was the hardest boss i've ever seen in a video game
@Jerma985 if you get the boots you can climb the elevator
He's never going to come back to the hospital
I'm actually starting to think this is a real life
why is jerma's mic so loud today? LUL
You just have to make the full line
they're not gonna make the money back LUL
It's the "I'm going to pee" joke again
Oh yeah, I'm gonna need a lot of time to catch up
@Jerma985 Why are you going to the basement
i cant believe you're still streaming this game
i dont think it's possible to beat this game without breaking all the rules
I had a dream that Jerma died to Pinwheel
@Jerma985 is that the guy that did the whole stream?
just watch the movies for the longest time
@Jerma985 PLEASE READ THIS, YOU ARE A PROFESSOR
@Jerma985 you have to take the water with you
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1658. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
This is the worst stream I’ve ever seen
I love this song. It's so sad that Jerma is still using it
what did i just come back to
@Jerma985 you have to do the final boss
Jerma do you have any plans to play other games this year?
If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 you need to make a save point and go to the red bar, that's the main way
@Jerma985 Just put the entire house in the middle
he's gonna do this as a joke
@Jerma985 that's why you're a good actor jerma
@Jerma985 do you think they will ever get the good ending?
@Jerma985 is it really a bad game if you can't play it?
I don't know, I'm just a fan of the game, not the game
@Jerma985 There's a frog in your room, how long has he been playing this game?
i think you can put a good block on the top left
i just got here, is he playing the next rumble?
oh my god he's trying to say the actual words
jermaWalk i need to go to the bathroom
Is this the guy who beat the first level on stream?
@Jerma985 The last time you were in the bathroom was a week ago
I swear to god if Jerma is dead I will make a JUP
@Jerma985 do you have any plans on playing other games this year?
@Jerma985 can you make a vive for the stream?
You need to be able to see the drain
@Jerma985 "I can't see my eyes" - Jerma
====================
I hope you like your car more than I like your car :)

@Jerma985 did you get a sub to the stream?
jermaHeart its a good game, but it's a little buggy
I'm gonna give you $500.00 to win :)
@Jerma985 I have a feeling you won't like the game
i cant believe this is actually going to be an ice age
but if you cant get it to work, you are going to be a liar.
jermaWalk jermaWalk LET'S GO TO THE ERASER jermaWalk
you have to put the plate on the floor
i like the taste of hot butter on toast
@Jerma985 i thought you said that you didn't want to play this
I bet you didn't even read the title of that one
You gotta get the boots for this boss
@Jerma985 You can use the boots to get in the arena
@Jerma985 please do the underwater voice so we can hear it
i cant believe jerma is a robot :)
@Jerma985 You should play this game on your own
@Jerma985 It's a thing and it's a good thing
did you just say you were gonna be a fucking psycho?
@Jerma985 you can find the secret menu in the menu bar, then go back to the menu bar to get the secret menu
@Jerma985 you need to be able to get the coin
Jerma, you're going to have to drink a gallon of water.
@Jerma985 you can get a little discount on all the big macs
@Jerma985 You need to buy a bunch of rocks to get the other one
so the stream is gonna be like this
imagine if this was a game about the lego lord of the rings
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that won the boomer game?
there was a big enemy with a gun
@Jerma985 You can't just tell the story to someone who's already played it
If you werent a twitch streamer you'd be a boomer
@Jerma985 This is a really cool joke, hope you enjoy it
i can't believe this is a real stream
@Jerma985 your level is too high, you need to get up to level 2
Why does he have to go all the way back to the castle
@Jerma985 If you see the moon, you know it's a really big moon
You can't even put it on the floor
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this game?
theres a bunch of cieling in this game
@Jerma985 It's a new game, this is what happens
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this in the first place?
you need to take your shoes off before you go to the bathroom
He's never gonna beat this game because he never got his shit
@Jerma985 You don't need to put the boots on the floor
"I don't know what you're talking about" - Jerma985
JERMA I DONT HAVE A BOWL FOR A COW
It's a lot easier to be a bad person than it is to be a good person
if jerma was alive today we would be dead already jermaPluto
he's just a good boy, he's just not as good as he used to be
@Jerma985 No, they're both from the UK.
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup0 jermaJup1

This is the last time we see you LUL
I like to watch you play with my dad :)
I hope the last time you use the bathroom you just look at the floor
hey guys if you wanna know what the fuck is happening i've been watching your streams for 2 hours
I just came back, why is the streamer still on this?
the most beautiful person on this planet is you
I can't believe Jerma is a fake gamer
@Jerma985 you have to make a new one first
We all know you can't do it, but can you do it?
====================
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUN,
@Jerma985 this is the only game you are going to play
@Jerma985 you have to click on the bars to get the "invite"
@Jerma985 you need to build an army to keep your troops from getting eaten
@Jerma985 it's called the "Invalidate your vote" thing
jerma is a dog that can't eat anything
@Jerma985 I got a pizza, and it's still good
jermaPop jermaJex2 jermaJex2 It's the only emote that has been removed, jermaPop jermaJex2

@Jerma985 you should have the body bag instead of the other ones
I thought you were going to play this
@Jerma985 You can't kill him just start over
@Jerma985 you can get the chicken on the ground
no wonder he went to sleep like this
you should do the big gold door joke
Jerma is gonna have to play this game

what the hell is a jerma joke what the fuck
I didn't know that jerma was a dog
I want you to play as the other dogs
@Jerma985 you said you were gonna play the game that wasnt made for children
Why is this game so hard to watch?
@Jerma985 You have to see all the buttons
I remember that one time I had a dream where I was the only person on earth that could figure out what the fuck was going on
@Jerma985 play the game again to make it better
i hope you get better at this game :)
@Jerma985 the game is designed to be played in a hard mode
He's doing a full orchestra of voices and it's not even funny
this game is gonna be a mess LUL
I like how Jerma is trying to pretend that he's not actually a doctor and not just a streamer, but a kid
Jerma is the one guy who doesn't want to live with his mom
cheer100 Hey Jerma, I'm glad you're doing a great job. I'm really looking forward to seeing you play this game. I really want to see you play it, but I can't get a date for when I'm gonna be watching the stream.
my grandma just gave birth to me and she's crying
@Jerma985 Just put the light on to make it look like your house is burning
@Jerma985 is this the new Pokemon? @Jerma985
i love the music and the way you make it feel
hey @Jerma985 did you get the boots?
"hey guys i got a new laptop that looks awesome"
@Jerma985 you can use the left mouse button to delete the last frame
if you can't eat food on stream you're not a human
@Jerma985 go to the back of the store
i think it's just a bug, it's not a joke
i think its because they have a huge amount of plastic in the bathroom
@Jerma985 the fuck are you talking about?
its just a bootleg game with a million dollars in cash
I'd be a great one guy if I were Jerma :)
jerma can you please play the rest of the game
I think you're a bit of a scientist now.
@Jerma985 i got a pizza. and it's still good.
@Jerma985 you should have put the door with the hulk in the back, he's a little bit bigger
@Jerma985 DO A TON OF TRUCKS IN A SITTING

@Jerma985 are you going to play the Monster Rancher series?
I wish they put on a song about the end of the universe

the guy who got a fuckface in the tutorial
@Jerma985 I'm gonna shit if you don't tell me you're a jerma fan.
i just got here and i just got here
@Jerma985 I think you need to level up your weapon
That was a good idea to get the final boss before you die
you could have used a manual or something
@Jerma985 I have to be a bit taller than you to get a better look
jerma is literally the only person who's ever played this game
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
I just got here, what's going on? :)
jermaWalk ILL MAKE A NEW PERSON IN THE NEW JERMA jermaWalk
I'm gonna go back to the carnival, you know that?
i wish i had the money to buy that mod
I'm gonna need a facecam for the next stream
@Jerma985 You can just keep them in the first place
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -362. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
it's gonna be a cool stream when it comes to simpsons
I hate that this guy's been on this channel for like 3 years
you have to be on the moon to have a light
this is what they call a "franker" stream
@Jerma985 Go back to the ship and turn off the lights
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, can you make a new song?
if you can't beat the game then don't play it
I just got here, what the hell is this?
@Jerma985 Put the part of the song in the intro
we're gonna see you at the carnival stream
its not a secret you need to get the slime
@Jerma985 You can do this with the other hand
@Jerma985 go back to the beginning of the game and play the tutorial again
i heard jerma is a great actor :)
I don't think this is an e3 event
Jerma, you have to stop the stream for me.
he is going to get a heart attack
LUL he just wanted to get his money back
Is this the guy who died to Pinwheel?
jerma you have a great character, I love you <3
@Jerma985 you know what they say, you have a terrible sense of humor
@Jerma985 I'm on the same screen, can you stop pretending?
the game is supposed to be like this
It's the power of the katamari rooster
jermaWalk DREW CREW IS IN THE HOUSE jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you have to do the "what are you talking about?" joke
jerma, i'm trying to do my taxes and you're telling me to go to the bank?
@Jerma985 you can do that with the other hand
imagine not using a mouse for this game
jermaWalk GIVE ME YOUR FOREHEAD AND I WILL MAKE A BOOB JOKE
Jerma is the giant rat that makes all of the rules
@Jerma985 you have to make it on the island
It was a real-world example of how to deal with the plague
@Jerma985 Can you please move on from the rats?
if you were a kid you would have stopped the stream
jermaOld I'm just a human being, I can't hear you.
Can we get a facecam so we can see the 2ndJerma pic?
youre the only one who's ever streamed this game
imagine getting your hair pulled back in order to cover up your bald spot
@Jerma985 Are you planning on playing more dreams today?
Jerma is going to turn into a scooby doo character
I was a kid, I remember when we were in the pool
@Jerma985 just go to the bottom of the screen, you can climb there
@Jerma985 You can't just cut it out with a knife
I'm not gonna lie, I'm really glad I can watch this
@Jerma985 I know what you're talking about, you're a funny guy.
you can't call me a jerma fan because I don't have a youtube channel
this is like that one game where you just run away from the cops
is this the streamer that was in the shower and beat a kid?
This game is the best part of the movie
Jerma can you please make it a little less than 5 minutes?
i feel like this is a new idea
it isnt the fault of the gamer, it was a failure
@Jerma985 you can still make it up on your own
You need to get the rings to unlock the secret door
@Jerma985 The only way to win is to not beat it
====================
One of my favorite games of all time is Call of Juarez, it's one of my all time favorite games.
I think you are the only one that can see this
i don't think you can do this jerma
chat is still going so fast no one will notice
this is the best part of the stream
@Jerma985 you can't have a car with a manual transmission
@Jerma985 I'm the guardian of sus! I thank you for your service!
jerma is playing a game he likes so much
is he gonna be able to get the easter egg again?
Jerma, if you don't get your wink done, I'm going to have to take my own life
@Jerma985 JERMA, I think you've broken your kneecaps
@Jerma985 just add a second text to the end
I think you need to get the mouse to do the first part
How did the developers make this game so easy
I dont think he's going to get that much
@Jerma985 why do you have to put a plate on top of it?
@Jerma985 it's like when you're in a movie
@Jerma985 you're going to die if you get stuck
@Jerma985 I just got back, is he still doing the first part?
I want to see the AI that plays this game.
@Jerma985 You can buy the new Mount and Blade DLC
I think he's gonna lose it LUL
@Jerma985 You can't beat the boss if you have no boots.
@Jerma985 This game is my favourite game of all time
I would have watched you if you had done this
@Jerma985 You need to get the other pieces in the car
he said he was going to play it sometime
I think you have to put the other two to the back of the car
I never knew that a casino was on the line
jerma is in the black hole what a god of a gamer
I just got here, what happened? Is this the streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
You can't make fun of him if you don't want him to die.
@Jerma985 Have you considered playing the game as a kid?
@Jerma985 how are you still in the game?
@Jerma985 Can you tell us the story of your parents and you?

@Jerma985 Do you think the game's music is in the game?
@Jerma985 are you gonna play Animal Crossing again?
I'm an old man, I can't read. Please tell me how to read

@Jerma985 I think you need to put the other two to the back of the car
@Jerma985 put the first game in the back of the car
@Jerma985 IF YOU WANNA DIE IN THE GAME IM SORRY
I think you have to put the other two to the back of the car
@Jerma985 are you going to play the new game or what?
i cant believe you just joined the stream
@Jerma985 you have to buy the new saddle
jermaDafoe You have to get the other guys
He's just playing the game for the money
@Jerma985 get the vive thing for the foveal
@Jerma985 are you going to play the entirety of the game?
@Jerma985 you need to pick up the coins
@Jerma985 The "unfriendly" guy is actually a real actor
I think the main character is the star of this
@Jerma985 YOU'RE A DICK BUT NOT A DICK
dude I hate this game, i love this game
@Jerma985 Did you know that no one in the world is real?
this game is my favorite game of all time
it's okay if you don't play it then you can't go back
you have to take the phone out of your pocket
LOOKS LIKE THE NEW JERMA IS HERE jermaVenus
SOMEONE KEEP IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR
@Jerma985 what's the worst one you can do?
i was gonna say this is a joke
jermaVenus "This is a new era of capitalism"
@Jerma985 you need to put the other ones to the back
Hes just a weirdo that makes money from the advertisements
@Jerma985 You have to save
====================
This is the only way to win the game :)
@Jerma985 you should play the tutorial game where you play as the boss
I really wanna see you play this :)
Oh I thought this was a bathtub stream
jermaChomp 📣 THIS IS A COFFEE CHOCOLATE, I HATE IT
can we get some more fortnite jerma please
Is this the guy who beat the first level of Jump King?
this game is like the first time i've ever seen this game
I'm watching a Jerma streamer and he's streaming in the background
why does he sound like a wall
He's gonna be a maniac when he finds out what he's doing
@Jerma985 you have to do the cooking stream, you can't stop us
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
This game looks like it's from a horror movie
If I had a sub I would donate $50
I don't think they're going to get that one
I think it's a video game game reference

I just woke up from my nap. What is this?
Jerma you need to stop this stream from going on for two hours

you can shoot a bullet through the wall
JERMA PLEASE CHANGE THE VOICE YOU ARE MAKING THIS GAME SO FUCKING FUN
@Jerma985 if you do, you'll be a millionaire and will have a huge influence in the world

@Jerma985 you can buy the "change my mind" card
@Jerma985 What do you think of the game
@Jerma985 The trick is to get the music wrong

the sound of a fishing boat in the ocean

The fact that you're playing this game is a surprise

This game is like an episode of The Simpsons
@Jerma985 You can buy the vive and play the game
@Jerma985 This is a great game and i love it
@Jerma985 you should get a barista to get in there and help you

i never knew you could be this bad at this game
@Jerma985 If you just sit in the toilet you'll never have a chance to pee

I remember the first time I saw a jerma emote
Jerma I'm having a hard time believing you are still streaming. I'm so fucking confused

@Jerma985 you need to throw the sword in the fire
I can't believe Jerma's playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 You need to get the shovel to do the "arm"
jermaOld I'm so used to a game like this
@Jerma985 Do you think that would be a good stream?
@Jerma985 i think this is the reason you didnt finish the first level
JERMA IS A FAN OF HIS OWN JERMA
i think he just wanted to go home and eat
Jerma you're getting old, you're going to get old
@Jerma985 you can do it if you do a good job :)
I can't believe Jerma died to the giant rat in TF2
Why do you sound like you have a floppy drive
@Jerma985 he's a cop he's in the police station
@Jerma985 You can't just throw a rock at them
@Jerma985 do you know the actual definition of insanity?
you have to do the same thing over and over again
I can't believe Jerma's streaming is in his basement
my dad said it was a joke and he died
If you can't tell a joke, it's not funny
@Jerma985 just have your arm cut off and then a purple heart will come out
@Jerma985 You gotta shoot the guy with the grenade
@Jerma985 when you do a really good job, you'll get a lot of free subs
@Jerma985 you can hit the wall to get the money back
This is the worst boss fight in the game
i think it was just an innocent kid
@Jerma985 Jerma, I can't believe you're playing this game for the first time.
@Jerma985 You should do the water level from the first game
@Jerma985 I just got here and you're still playing this?

@Jerma985 Did you ever get a key to the door?
Jerma i'm still hungry, do you know how much I make?
"if i eat a shoe, will you eat a shoe?"
@Jerma985 You can't take the fall damage because you're too low
The first thing Jerma says when he gets the stream title is "I'm gonna be honest I'm really excited to watch this stream"
i had a dream i heard jerma be funny
@Jerma985 i just got here and i can't believe you're still playing this game
I can't believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
i can't believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
Jerma, if you play this game it's gonna be really hard
You need to stop watching your own streams
you should be a kid, you're gonna get caught
I'm sure you'd like to see this streamer play Mario Maker.
@Jerma985 if you get the controller you can have a better looking one
The voices in this game are so fucking annoying
@Jerma985 if you do that you're a terrible parent
I just got here and you're still playing this?
You need to be
====================
A letter from the Boston Celtics to Joel
The kims are the best, the kims are the worst
@Jerma985 just put the two jups in the box
The next boss is a monkey, he's going to fall down
Jerma just cut the batteries in half and you'll be playing with them
@Jerma985 Please don't tell the kid that you're a furry.
What's the name of this game, is it like a caveman or something?
imagine a boss that has been in a stream for more than 3 hours
@Jerma985 You can't just put it in the wrong place
I just joined, what the hell is going on?
This is the only place you can go to jerma
This is a bit of a jank stream
@Jerma985 You should play the other games, like Sekiro
@Jerma985 No one is using the camera at this point
jerma you should start using the power of the camera for the next game
@Jerma985 please don't make me the giant rat
why are you talking about it and not about your penis
how does this game not have a 2nd person view
@Jerma985 jerma you are literally the only person who can be mad at this game

I don't know how to get to the next level
@Jerma985 what's your opinion on bttv emotes?
@Jerma985 do you think it's a bad idea to have a jermaLiedAboutOnLive
@Jerma985 You can't beat the first level of the game

@Jerma985 make the bottom of the boat bigger
@Jerma985 use the blue coins on the other side

jerma is the only person who can be mad at this game
I heard the apocalypse is coming this year
@Jerma985 you should do a stream with Otto
@Jerma985 play the game and not the game
jerma you are my favorite streamer :)
I thought that was the thing with the cat, you should know
I'd like to see the streamer play the game, but I don't want to see him play it.
@Jerma985 you should go to the shipyard to get a bigger dynamite
you're gonna get stuck in the end of this
i just want to watch jerma play video games
i think i'll just be a girl when i get to 20
@Jerma985 do you have a diaper? I dont want to know
this is what happens when you don't use your own voice
I just got here, what the fuck happened
I think it would be better if he did a redo
I can't believe Jerma is streaming on time.
chat has never played this game before LUL
"I have to do it" - Jerma985
if you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 i think you need to find a way to use the face cam
The guy who made this is a great guy
@Jerma985 You have to do the right thing
@Jerma985 do a one last hit in the game
@Jerma985 You should put on a full facecam
@Jerma985 I don't think you can hear the voices, it's just the music
i have no idea how to use the camera
@Jerma985 please stop this joke it makes me feel bad
jerma you have the facecam on, can you change it to the other one
@Jerma985 is it just me or does your hair look weird
@Jerma985 how do you even do that
@Jerma985 this is a perfect opportunity to make a children's game
@Jerma985 YOU CAN BUILD BOTH OF THEM, YOU CAN BUILD THE BOTH
@Jerma985 do you have a really cool and funky guitar?
I hope Jerma doesn't have any viewers or he will be dead
@Jerma985 the game is in a bunch of different states
@Jerma985 you should be a robot, that's why you're a robot
@Jerma985 you have to do the other ones first
I thought that was the thing that was in the closet
@Jerma985 The devil is in
====================
I'm just trying to make sense of this
@Jerma985 I don't think you're even a human anymore
it's a chad? its not a chad
@Jerma985 They're basically just a regular human with a different name
jermaPluto He's going to be late again
I can't believe he just fucking shat on his face
This is the guy who beat dark souls on stream
He's gonna play it again just to get his ass kicked
i cant believe this guy is a psycho
@Jerma985 you can turn off the lights in the corners
why does he sound like the guy from TF2
did you ever know that the music for a game was the soundtrack to this game?
@Jerma985 you can use the stone to get to the secret room
@Jerma985 Put your mouth open so you can hear the game better
Can you just run over him so you don't have to tell him to stop
@Jerma985 you'll be able to do this game when you are 100% in the game
@Jerma985 you can't have a bad taste in a bad game
@Jerma985 There's a thing on the side of the house with a little bit of cheese on it
@Jerma985 Have you tried the GoT? It's a very similar game
Just a reminder that I was a sub for a year ago
@Jerma985 I just got here, why is your stream still running?
@Jerma985 There's a new game coming out, it's called "Cursed Earth"
You've seen him before. You're in the past.
Jerma you can't have a bad taste in a bad game.
@Jerma985 Please play the new game of thrones soundtrack
@Jerma985 it was the story of a guy who dies to a giant spider
@Jerma985 This is a very sad game, please stop
@Jerma985 I think you've been playing it for a while
@Jerma985 The new trailer makes it look like you're in a room with a different camera
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the fuck is happening
you can kill enemies with your bare hands
@Jerma985 The only reason why I liked it so much is because of the intro
"I'm sorry I didn't get my gift sub"
@Jerma985 You can still buy a candy bar if you do it at a gas station
@Jerma985 why do you have a full-body mask?
you can't just go to the past and go back to the past
@Jerma985 it's a custom game, you have to do it.
@Jerma985 What about the fuckin Tunguska Shanty?
"I got a 20 year old son"
@Jerma985 This game is a lot more fun than I thought
this is the best jerma game so far
@Jerma985 what did you say to that man
@Jerma985 When are you gonna play another game?
@Jerma985 You can't do it with your hands.
@Jerma985 That's a great way to say that
I can't believe jerma is a bad boy
The only way to stop this is to have fun :)
Why is there a tiki torch in the hallway
@Jerma985 can you play some doom ost please?
@Jerma985 they're the only ones that made this game
If you're good at something never do it for free
we need to get a real jerma rumble
he's gonna be late because he's never coming back
i can't believe jerma is dead :( jermaPluto
you gotta do a 2nd floor balcony to get to the second floor
I don't think it's in the game
@Jerma985 If you have a child, put them in the room to learn to speak
the only thing you need to do is to cut off their arms
no theres a weird gold coin in the vault
I don't think you can actually make a machine with your bare hands.
i like how the whole thing is a fucking game
@Jerma985 you can shoot a hole in the ground
@Jerma985 So is this the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 can you do a flip and reverse?
Can we just watch the whole stream from the bottom of the screen?
This is the game that is more boring than the first game
i cant believe you're playing a game that makes you feel like you're not actually in the game
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the recent death of jerma?
@Jerma985 i'm a young girl and my mom said you can't stream until i'm old enough to be a sub
Jerma you're not supposed to play this game
====================
@Jerma985 The end is a little more complex than the beginning
imagine going to the dentist for a kidney stone and you just die
You have to do it yourself, or you will die
@Jerma985 It's the thing that makes you not want to use the guns.
@Jerma985 i need to be paid to be a doctor

@Jerma985 You can put your hands up and its just the floor
@Jerma985 you can have a pee pee poo poo poo
@Jerma985 What if you were to die and it was a great joke?
@Jerma985 You need to get rid of the boots

i dont think thats a real thing
@Jerma985 you have to run out of time to get the door
@Jerma985 You can put a plate in the trash can
@Jerma985 Do you have a guide for the game?
i just got here, what did he do
@Jerma985 You can use a controller to play the game, just be sure to put on the microphone and plug it in
Why does Jerma have so many bosses?
He got hit by the car and then fell down the stairs
@Jerma985 He's gonna miss the whole stream LUL
we can't stop now because of the big stream
@Jerma985 They had to get the boots to go back in
"the dude who did the poop joke"
@Jerma985 when are you going to play the sequel
I love how Jerma is like "I'm gonna take a nap" and everyone is like "no I'm gonna get up and shit"
YOU CAN'T BURN IT OFF TO DEFEAT IT
@Jerma985 you have to put the camera up top
@Jerma985 can you show us your other hand
I just got here and I'm STILL on this
@Jerma985 when you die, you have to restart the game
HEY JERMA YOU CAN SPAM IT LIKE THIS
I thought that was the end of the stream
@Jerma985 you don't have to do it now
I wonder if there is a hidden thing in this game
I remember when you said you were playing the mario brothers games.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -93. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 hey jerma, you said you'd play Kenshi
Jerma's gonna be in the next Jerma Rumble, chat.
I want you to do the "good" voice for me
You're going to have to play the game for an hour
i miss the old jerma that was so calm
@Jerma985 you have to find the one that doesn't spawn
i had a dream you had to eat ass
It was a real jerma and I'm telling you
i can't believe he's playing this game as a kid
I think you can use the boots to go back to the ship
@Jerma985 It's like you're trying to be a bad guy, you just have to beat the game
@Jerma985 You can put a plate in the trash can
I would love to see a Jerma stream.
@Jerma985 did you ever put on the F1
@Jerma985 You can put a plate in the trash can
@Jerma985 theres a camera on the floor next to you
@Jerma985 the 2nd hardest boss is the one you're trying to beat
I'm gonna be the one who yells at you when you're at the fire
@Jerma985 you should have a 2nd camera next to the door
@Jerma985 Jerma you are a britney LUL
I’ll try to keep it on my computer if you dont get a gift sub
I just got here and I'm still waiting for the stream
theres a huge rat in the back of my pants
Jerma, this game is not for you
jerma you have to be the best jerma
@Jerma985 This is why you are a slave to this game
@Jerma985 I know it's not a good idea but you can stop it
why are you doing this to me? what do i do?
oh my god he's wearing a diaper and not a jacket

@Jerma985 You're gonna get a bunch of red flags
@Jerma985 You can move the button to the right
@Jerma985 there is a sword
====================
@Jerma985 Your voice sounds like a fucking Will Smith, which is pretty fucked up
my cat was in the room and I thought it was her
@Jerma985 you can place a lot of furniture in the back of the house
did he say what he was gonna do today?

Why do you think people only watch you for the money
@Jerma985 Are you going to play the game again?
@Jerma985 You can use the fullscreen to see the messages you are in
I'm sure this guy has a ton of cool stuff to do

@Jerma985 I'm gonna be honest, the next step of this game is gonna be fucking terrifying
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this? Why are you still playing this?
Is this the streamer that beat pinwheel on stream?
I have a feeling he's gonna do this
@Jerma985 I'll be honest, I don't really care about the game at all.
@Jerma985 When you were a kid you used to play with your hands

Oh my god you're still here, I just got here
@Jerma985 The video is the "I'm not gonna lie" joke, you'll never be able to get past that
I thought you were supposed to go to the top of the tower
he's just a liar because he doesn't want to admit that he's a liar
you have to do the first part of the puzzle
i think its the new book of the bible
JERMA YOU ARE IN A DROP, WE WANT YOU TO STAY
@Jerma985 I think you can turn off the alarm to prevent zombies
@Jerma985 Do you know how to play a game?
@Jerma985 You're only gonna get one hit, right?
@Jerma985 You have to be a gamer to do this
do you think he has a tiny bit of a beard
why is there a noclip in the first stream?
@Jerma985 If you are good at something never do it for free

@Jerma985 please tell me if you have the map open and you're not using the map
jerma is gonna die in a few weeks
The first person to comment on a Jerma video is a fucking idiot
@Jerma985 That was a good one, I'm glad I didn't miss it, I'm sorry I wasn't the one who made it
you're not supposed to eat the fish but you're supposed to eat the fish
I hate you. I hate you like this.
@Jerma985 did you know that the cow is in the water
@Jerma985 are you going to stream for another week?

Jerma you are the reason we love you so much
i dont think the stream is going to be this long
@Jerma985 I'm going to go and sleep now :)

@Jerma985 you should turn down the audio for this one
@Jerma985 What did you do with the gamecube controllers?
If you don't get the money you have to play
@Jerma985 Jerma, can you turn down the volume please?
you have to put your hand up the sides
Jerma can you use your mic to tell us what game you're playing?
@Jerma985 Jerma, please don't be afraid to show your feet. They are so obvious
@Jerma985 you have to pay a toll to get to the next town

@Jerma985 dont forget to use the heal on your own
@Jerma985 that's not how you look at it
He's a mommy with a toddler on the front
@Jerma985 you can see it in the video
you should have more than one camera, that's what the game is for
@Jerma985 it's the one with the dumb camera
you're gonna get a lot of fucking money
you can't do anything about it if you don't want to
I feel like this is just a joke
@Jerma985 It's because you're watching a game that's been on for like 20 years
@Jerma985 Do you have a gamecube controller?
i was actually thinking of a game today
this is the only game he's ever played
Jerma, you're not going to win the next game, so I'm not gonna be able to catch it
@Jerma985 this is the worst joke of 2019
@Jerma985 The only thing you need to do is kill the other ones
I mean, it's a game that's been around for like a year, it's only been in the works for a week
you can't beat the game without killing the other one
I don't know what that is, but I'm glad I didn't miss it
i cant believe jerma is actually a hobo
this game has been so hard to watch
I remember the days when we could all just watch Jerma's streams on Youtube and he'd be fine. But now we can watch his streams.
I didn't know this game had the

Jerma is just a bunch of people who don't know how to play video games
just put the snow in the ice

@Jerma985 you should play a real game like this one
@Jerma985 I've been in the market for a game that has that
You have to go to the next level, the first one is the hardest
i think i saw the new ad for the movie
@Jerma985 you need to play the big ones, they are really fun
@Jerma985 use the nunchuck on your head to make it smaller
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream??
@Jerma985 There are not too many people in the audience
@Jerma985 the guy in the bottom right is in the bottom left
This is like the intro of a new york movie
I think you have to do the "not hard" part
@Jerma985 You can only play on the disc that is hard
I'm a little concerned about how the stream is going
i can't tell if it's a good or bad thing
@Jerma985 there's a really good simpsons hit and run one
@Jerma985 You have to turn on the starlight when you're in the air
@Jerma985 can you show us your feet on stream
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not
jermaOld That's how it is in the movies
@Jerma985 do you know what a cornflake is?
jermaWalk I'm going to give you a kidney stone
This is a pretty good looking game I'm sure

I love that you can be a furry and be a hero
if you get hit by a car you are not a hero
I can't wait for Jerma to die to Pinwheel!
@Jerma985 this is why we dont have a 2nd Jerma Rumble
YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO IT WHEN YOU WERE MADE
HE WANTS TO SEE THE ENTIRE SONG
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE SO FAST AND LATE

Jerma are you going to play VR? :)
theres a big difference between a jerma stream and a jerma show
I'm sure he'll be fine, if he does not get it it's a real disappointment
Why do you have to be so good at this game?
if you had a cat i'd be a happy cat
i don't think he's been doing the controls
@Jerma985 you need to have a saddle to get the boots
He's gonna be like "what the fuck is this"
i mean you have to put them in the bag for a loan
Jerma has been streaming for 6 hours and has been playing this for 7 hours
This game is actually boring, but the world is so cool
what's that, a horse? D:
jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus jermaVenus jerma
====================
The game is a great game, but you're just gonna play the game for a few hours and it's not going to work out
@Jerma985 You have to have the characters to be the giant enemy spider
SourPls Just like what you said, I'm trying to find a way to watch this
@Jerma985 if you can't beat the boss fight it's hard
jermaPluto this is gonna be a lot of hype
I love how the town is getting so much attention
jerma please get your mouth smashed by a bus
jermaChomp 📣 DON'T GO IN THE WINDOW, DON'T GO OUT, GO IN THE WINDOW
I think he might have a pet rat that makes him happy
@Jerma985 Why are you streaming this game, I want to see it
@Jerma985 You need to start the game with the Dead Rising 2 soundtrack
why are you still here? what happened to your soul?
@Jerma985 you can pick up the boots if you get the boots
@Jerma985 the key is to jump off the ledge
I love the streams that Jerma takes to prove that he is not a boomer
I'm gonna get a +2 if you go the wrong way :)
@Jerma985 I was thinking of this game for a while and I just got here
He has to watch the stream live to read it
jermaWalk Hey chat, just joined the stream, can you please start? jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you can get rid of the guards with the ice axe
@Jerma985 this is a real game you should be playing it
jermaWalk HOW DARE YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE jermaWalk
@Jerma985 do you know how much the cam is jermaIQ
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO TURN ON R9K PAPER PRINT ON
@Jerma985 I'm from the future, but the past is still here
LUL do you have a diaper on in the back?
@Jerma985 Just don't use the time thing jermaDisgust
i cant believe this is the guy who died to pinwheel on stream
there's a lot of work to go in there
You need to take a nap to calm down
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
I can't believe he's still playing this LUL
@Jerma985 The difference between the two is that you can't kill him
i was just listening to a weird jazz tune and I didn't understand it
@Jerma985 go to the bottom of the stairs
@Jerma985 you can't say what you want to say, because he'll get angry
what if we kissed in the dream :)
@Jerma985 This is the same guy who beat Dark Souls on stream
@Jerma985 You need to shoot the enemies first
Jerma, you can't make jokes in this game, it's not funny
jerma you need to know how to cook
if you get to the other side you can just jump off the ledge
why do you look like a batman in this game
why did he go back to the back
@Jerma985 Hey jerma, I'm in the same boat as you, you're going to have to take the other side
jerma is gonna be an asshole if he doesn't put the order in
@Jerma985 You should have had a nice swing that gave you the easy kill
Jerma can't even watch the stream and can't even afford to buy the game jermaPluto
That was a great idea, I hope you get to play more of this game
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play more Animal Crossing?
@Jerma985 hey do you have a diaper on in the back?
@Jerma985 the game is just making you realize that you are going to die
@Jerma985 Please tell me you never had a big heart and a big ass
@Jerma985 YOU CAN SAVE THE GAME WITH A BONUS
@Jerma985 The other 4 can be really useful
I have to leave now, this is going to take like an hour
it's because the game makes it so you can't even go to the save
@Jerma985 you are the best gamer on twitch
just make the roads just a little more straight
@Jerma985 If you can't see the sun, it's a fake moon.
You're gonna get so mad if you don't do it
Jerma is a lot of fun to watch

@Jerma985 please play the doom ost jerma, it is really cool and fun to listen to
Jerma will never be able to make a clown car
@Jerma985 You can go to the top of the tree
I had a dream I got a gift sub
i can't believe you're gonna beat this game in 5 hours
@Jerma985 you can't just go in a certain area
@Jerma985 that was just a fucked up joke
If you read this you should know the official description of this game
@Jerma985 Can we get a face cam for the rest of the stream?
@Jerma985 if you win the game it's called fighting game
I’ll be honest, I don’t think you’d need a second monitor
I just joined the stream, what happened? monkaS
Jerma can you please get some pogs in the chat?
@Jerma985 What is the difference between the facecam and the scratch card?
you can get a good quality stream in this game

@Jerma985 did you know that you can't change your clothes?
@Jerma985 no it's a character in the game
@Jerma985 you need to make it to the other end
@Jerma985 do you know how much money you will make
@Jerma985 can we get a rewind to when you beat the game?
@Jerma985 do you think your next stream is gonna be with Kim?
This guy is a fucking idiot he can't get the knife
@Jerma985 did you ever get your lunch box?
I can't wait for the next stream, Jerma's gonna be late
this is the most realistic thing to do
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -188. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
@Jerma985 theres a secret to the secret ending
you're not supposed to do this, you're already dead
@Jerma985 I'm gonna say the n word for you
i'm not sure if it's a joke or not
dont tell me what i'm watching jermaSun jermaSun
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TO THE EGGS
i got a sub gift sub gift sub gift sub
I think you have to go into the closet and put your hand up your ass
@Jerma985 don't you just want to see the family guy?
@Jerma985 you can't have a gun in this game
@Jerma985 There's a secret boss in the cave
@Jerma985 the only thing you can do is watch the vod
@Jerma985 You have to set up the auto-cam and then press the map button.
this is how you make a house in this game
i can't believe i'm watching this streamer now
jermaWalk You’ve been watching jerma for 2 hours, now go back to your home jermaWalk
hey jerma, when are you gonna play nancy drew?
how is it a thing to do with your face?
if you have a half life game on it's not the best
I feel like you're doing the wrong thing.
@Jerma985 You're the only one who can actually beat this level
theres a secret boss in this
====================
YOU CAN DO IT
@Jerma985 The speedrun is so long it's like an hour long
i cant believe jerma is a kid again jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You can't just say you're going to die if you're not going to die.
I just saw a cool chat gif of you
@Jerma985 Your favorite Jerma video is called "The Scary Movie"
@Jerma985 I'm so sorry you're such a troublemaker. This is not how we treat you.
@Jerma985 I'm going to be honest, I think you're gonna be the best streamer in the world
You'll need to do it first then. I haven't seen anyone do it yet.
@Jerma985 PLEASE THE BATTLE HAS BOUGHT YOU YOUR GIRL
this is like the worst part of a real car crash
@Jerma985 I'm sure it's just a mental breakdown
how can you not like it? its got candy
@Jerma985 You can get in the bathtub with the money and no stream
guys i just got here what is happening
is this the guy who died to pinwheel
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
@Jerma985 there's a reason you didn't do it
this is the part where you literally die
just wait till he finds out how to get to the next part
You have to put your mind to something
@Jerma985 I think you need to be smarter than the average person
@Jerma985 did you see the new Pokemon movie?
you're supposed to go to the bathroom at the start
@Jerma985 will you be doing a whole stream?
JERMA you're supposed to go back to the beginning, you got that
@Jerma985 there's a really good reason for that, you can't do the mini-game
jerma's not gonna be in the next one
@Jerma985 No matter how hard you try, you'll never get the boots
This is the worst bit i have ever seen
how did you get so bad at this game?
did you say you were gonna play this?
Jerma is going to make me choke to death
JERMA YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCH A SHORT MAN
@Jerma985 What about the Simpsons Hit and Run OST
is this the streamer that got shanked by a 5 year old?
@Jerma985 I want to make sure you don't get a refund on your wink
@Jerma985 it's a game, the game is designed to be played
@Jerma985 if you do a bunch of taxes, you can get free land
I think you should be able to see it
@Jerma985 YOU DIDNT SEE THE FARTING DOOR TO THE ROOF
@Jerma985 what do you think of the game?
@Jerma985 you can have your entire team in one place
@Jerma985 you have to use the laser gun
I had a dream about a guy who ate two chicken nuggets in one sitting and the guy ate them all
i wonder if he's gonna play more of the final boss of this game
@Jerma985 are you going to play the rest of the game?
@Jerma985 we can see the same thing happening in the first place
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8 jermaJup9 jermaJup10 jermaJup11 jermaJup12 jermaJup13 jermaJup14 jermaJup15 jermaJup16 jermaJup17 jermaJup18 jermaJup19 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1

@Jerma985 Can you play the new pokemon game?
@Jerma985 you can make the sound effect louder
this is gonna be a great stream LUL
@Jerma985 you can press R to go back
you can't just do this to yourself :)
I don't even know what the fuck this is
@Jerma985 Why do you think you're a little short?
@Jerma985 you can get a new fad for this game
@Jerma985 have you tried to play the VR game
@Jerma985 When you're watching a movie, you can watch it live with a headset
@Jerma985 you have to watch the rest of the game
The only way to
====================
THE BIG BANG
@Jerma985 theres a lot of dlc in this game
i just came back, is he still playing this?
jerma is the president of the united states of america
@Jerma985 im the one guy, please give me a sub
i was here when jerma said he was going to play simpsons hit and run
@Jerma985 You should use the dpad to get a better angle
@Jerma985 You can use the circle to make a circle
I think this game would be funny if it wasnt so fucking dumb
jerma you should do a shitpost to your own channel
I think you're the one guy, I don't like that
jerma is the only one who uses the xbox controller LUL
@Jerma985 the one with the jerma emote is literally just a strawman
@Jerma985 you got the fish from the top shelf
This is the most generic anime I've ever seen.
i feel like this is a new era for this
@Jerma985 You're a Jerma fan, I've heard of your streams and I know you're a fan of this game. I hope you enjoy the game and have a good night! jermaHeart
Jerma, you're not going to get the golden egg
if you don't have a gun you're not a gun
@Jerma985 It's just that you're a boomer, you'll be a boomer
I'm gonna be honest, I just wish there was more to the stream than that.
i have to go to work, are you okay?
I don't think you can go through this without getting a bad ending
@Jerma985 you can't make a house with a boat
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're playing this game on your phone
You can do that in a few hours
He's trying to get a shot of some laxative
@Jerma985 the first 3 levels are in the tutorial
@Jerma985 theres a lot of dlc in this game
He is trying to get a shot of some laxative
@Jerma985 the game is just like an old car
@Jerma985 i was here when he said he was gonna play simpsons hit and run
I'm on the phone with my mom and dad and they're still doing the "when I was a kid" joke
jerma you have to wait for the stream to start
I love this game, it's really neat to see the characters reacting to eachother and interact with eachother and its really fun to watch
@Jerma985 Just wait until he says he's gonna play Animal Crossing again
@Jerma985 you need to make it the one guy
@Jerma985 the snake will be more powerful if you do this
@Jerma985 I'm afraid to say it, but I think it's cool
jerma is the voice actor for this game
jermaPluto Jerma is gonna be late in 30 minutes
I'm not even here, I'm just gonna sit here watching
@Jerma985 There's a new game coming out sometime in the future, and it's called "Crimson"
jermaOld jermaOld my mind is too big for this
This is the streamer that couldn't beat FEAR on stream
I will donate $100 if he plays it
I'd love to see Jerma play an official game
is this the streamer that beat simpsons hit and run on stream?
i think he's trying to be serious about it
it's a good game, but I don't think it's even worth it
@Jerma985 This is a great stream, but I'm not here to watch the game
@Jerma985 I thought you said you were gonna play something else
@Jerma985 the super stream was just a bad joke
This game is a work of art, you should watch it
I'm surprised that you can see the ocean
Dont worry, you'll be a great streamer soon enough :)
The only good streamer is jerma985. he's the best
@Jerma985 you can't just be a fuckface and not make it
this game is a mess, it sucks, but it's fun
@Jerma985 you have to beat the game first
the old lady is a vampire, can't be a witch
jermaOld I didn't know you were a twink jermaOld
I hate the game, but I love the characters
@Jerma985 what is your opinion on the Jerma T-shirt?
@Jerma985 jermaOneguy you could probably make it in here
i just realized im watching a streamer jermaPluto
If you could have a teacher you would
He said he was going to play simpsons hit and run tomorrow
oh
====================
S
hey jerma, this is my first time watching you, so i'm going to be a little disappointed
I don't think that's how they're supposed to look
He's actually going to be a great streamer :)
i dont think he's gonna be able to see the vod
the speedrun is a bit more complicated than this
@Jerma985 You don't have to worry about getting a little bonus in the game
@Jerma985 what's the secret to being a good streamer?
i hope you dont have to put on your clown costume again
@Jerma985 The ending of this game is going to be a good one
you just took the shit out of it
@Jerma985 This is the only way to win this fight
jerma i'm the biggest jerma fan in the world
jerma is like the guy from the spiderman movies
You have to pay for the car, not the food
That was so hard for me to believe
I just got here, what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 you should do the original boss of this game
@Jerma985 I think you need to use the high ground to get the big drops.
@Jerma985 You have to kill the AI and then it dies
@Jerma985 Make a small house out of wood
@Jerma985 can you just say it again, it's your fault for not having a sub
@Jerma985 If you're not a sub then you're a loser
@Jerma985 You should have a QTE of "THIS IS HOW YOU FEEL"
this is the best chat i have ever seen
jerma's going to get a good internet joke
@Jerma985 hey jerma, i think you should do the poll
@Jerma985 The only thing that can stop this man is the final boss
I hope you can play this game for the rest of your life
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE CARNIVAL jermaWalk
YOU CAN DO THIS FOR FREE ON TURN
@Jerma985 you know it's hard to be a "streamer" when you're just playing a game for your own enjoyment?
@Jerma985 You can't get to the start of the game
@Jerma985 It's a red light, the controls are broken.
@Jerma985 do you have to be in the same house as the other guy to get out of the elevator?
@Jerma985 I think you need to get the car to get the big drop
@Jerma985 DO NOT PUT A WINK IN CHAT
it's a 5 minute stream, you gotta play it right now
@Jerma985 why is your hair like that
I think Jerma has been playing with his cat for 4 hours
@Jerma985 please don't tell my mom to tell her I'm gay
I love that the game is over and he's still playing
Jerma what if I wanted to see your poop
You know what's not a joke? The fact that you're doing this
@Jerma985 you need to find the right food
@Jerma985 It's just a movie of the same kind
@Jerma985 Why do you have a toothpick in your mouth
@Jerma985 How do I turn off my son's music
@Jerma985 When you die, do you have to play this again?
I got some random shit to throw in
@Jerma985 I think you need to get a bed
@Jerma985 can you turn off the stream while i watch this?
I'm so glad that you're having fun with this game
@Jerma985 You can change your name to someone else and it's easy
This is a real funny joke, is it really funny?
this is the only way to win this fight
hey guys remember when jerma said he wasn't gonna play monster rancher again?
@Jerma985 you have to do the other side first
you need to be able to use the high ground
i think this game is fun but a little weird
@Jerma985 I think you need to find the door first
@Jerma985 you can't tell the difference between a yoke and a backpack
@Jerma985 the game is too easy for you
How can you not like it? It's got candies!
@Jerma985 you're gonna be bad at this one
just play the other half of the game
@Jerma985 You can use the high ground to get the big drops
jermaDafoe it's my birthday today, can you start the stream?
just do a backflip and get the boots
I think you're gonna need to put on a clown costume again
This is the only time I have ever seen you
I'm gonna have to get a new laptop

====================
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and see if you can take off the mask. Thanks!
@Jerma985 Can we get some jerma's chat for the stream?
@Jerma985 you just ruined the world for yourself
i wish i could get a sub jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Do the thing where you just say "I'm gonna go" and everyone just goes "Oh, I'm gonna go"
@Jerma985 please go to the bathroom and pee into the toilet bowl.
He's going to kill you if he gets too close to the camera
@Jerma985 You can use a drill to remove the mask
@Jerma985 Use the winks to get out of the castle
@Jerma985 you should go to the tutorial, it's pretty easy
jermaOld Back when the New Vegas came out, it was a long time coming
i can't wait for this stream to be over
@Jerma985 You can't just use the hammer to break a door
@Jerma985 hey jerma, do you think youll be playing on stream for at least 3 hours?
why is there a gmod thing in the middle of the stream
@Jerma985 you can press A to go to the other side
the red guy was a bank robber and we all know it
@Jerma985 This is the one where you just made a video
@Jerma985 you gotta do the other things to get it
I've been here for a while, the stream's been going pretty well
youre going to die at the end :)
I'm gonna be honest, I just don't feel like being a jerma fan anymore
@Jerma985 You just got on the wrong side of the map
@Jerma985 your voice sounds like that one guy who played mario 64 on stream
I just got here what is happening
@Jerma985 You should have a chat feature where people can tell you what you're doing
I don't think you need to go to the bathroom to do it
@Jerma985 I think you've never been to the bathroom before
i'm not a fucking idiot, i know the best way to do this
I think the one with the corn chips is the one with the cinnamon toast crunch
can we get a reminder of the labo stream
@Jerma985 There's a secret room in the top right corner
I just got here, what the hell is this
@Jerma985 You have to be a bit of a wimp
why did you turn off the camera? @Jerma985

====================
@Jerma985 its like the new vegas theme park ride
did you know that you have a right to be a furry?
@Jerma985 You gotta do some light stuff and shit, you're gonna be stuck in a hellhole for hours
if you dont get a pog you have to wait 10 seconds
just got back from the grocery store and hes still in there
Jerma needs to stop being a slave to the greedy jermaOneguy
they're not jerma's fault, he's an idiot streamer
I'm the only person who knows how to play this game. I don't even know how to play this game
@Jerma985 Have you ever been to a casino?
I hope he plays Jump King on stream
Why does this streamer have a diaper on
@Jerma985 do you know what a turtle is?
@Jerma985 can you turn up the volume for this game please
I'm watching the stream from a computer with my phone on
@Jerma985 why are you so angry you are talking about the gun
What the fuck are you doing to these people?
@Jerma985 I'm going to get a sub if you do this
I've never seen a streamer do that before
@Jerma985 YOU CAN MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A GOD
@Jerma985 You got the wrong part of the card
imagine being a kid and seeing the movie jerma985
@Jerma985 do you know how to make a pog?
I hope the vod is as good as the stream
@Jerma985 I think you can get the other game
i didnt know jerma was gonna get a jerma shirt
you can't have a good stream if you're not a good streamer
@Jerma985 No you are not. You can't buy a streamer
the last time we saw that you were a guy
@Jerma985 The last time I saw that was the last time I saw that
I'm gonna be here for a while, hope it's good
its like the chat in the beginning of the game
i can't believe jerma is a vroomer :)
@Jerma985 Why is your camera not being used
I think you need to be on the left side of the screen
i'm sure he's going to play it sometime soon
Jerma's gonna get a job at McDonald's
jermaOld I'm a terrible sports announcer, this is why I'm a good announcer
@Jerma985 I'll give you $5 to buy that game, I'll just keep it in the name.
You've got a lot of problems and a lot of problems to solve
@Jerma985 go to the elevator and use the cash to get to the next floor
if you can do a crossword puzzle, just do it in a room
I'm not sure if you're gonna watch the new movie, but it's a good one
Jerma you've been playing this for 5 hours and you just killed a cat
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that got addicted to crack?
@Jerma985 you can have a whole stream dedicated to the same joke, but you get to skip the parts you're bored of
@Jerma985 Can you do a funny joke to get a sub?
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that beat mr. mario on stream?
do you need a new computer to play this?
jerma why do you look like a vroomer
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to kill this guy to get the money
@Jerma985 can you say "I'm a girl" again?
i think theres a password for the game
@Jerma985 theres a bar next to the first door
@Jerma985 It's not a secret you've been doing this for the past 5 years
i like the first one it's the "oh shit" one
@Jerma985 If you die, you die in real life
you can't even use the ladder without the ladder
@Jerma985 Make the other one be a pickaxe
@Jerma985 Play the tutorial mission to get the boots
you know what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 if you're having a rough time, you should try "run"
@Jerma985 You got to do a few things, you know
jermaHeart im very excited for the new jerma rumble
@Jerma985 you'll be streaming in the next 4 hours
@Jerma985 the secret is that you can't get the top two
@Jerma985 I think you can get the top two from the other room
@Jerma985 can you do a side-by-side comparison?
The only thing I can do with a controller is watch Jerma play video games and
====================
A picture of Jerma is only 12 hours long
jerma is the only person i can watch jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You have to beat the boss to unlock the chest
@Jerma985 You don't have to play this game for the first time.
@Jerma985 im a furry and i do not want to hurt you
@Jerma985 theres a button for the door, you can open it
Why did you do this to yourself like this
you can buy a new weapon for the first time
Jerma why do you have a beard? @Jerma985
@Jerma985 the other character looks like you and he is now a complete psycho

@Jerma985 It's a game called "The Magma Golem" by the awesome band of developers at Mojave Studios
Theres a couple of people who are just saying "this is not a joke"
@Jerma985 you can get a free key for that
why is there a dragon in the water
you could have just bought the game already
I can't believe Jerma's actually playing a children's game

it's a new game for you but you'll still be able to play it for a while
you can have a streamer that doesn't know what a fish is
I'm sorry I don't have the gamer license
Why is the blood on the door but the floor?
@Jerma985 you have to turn the lights off to turn it on
That's the one I bought the most LUL
@Jerma985 if you had a third of the money
@Jerma985 is this a good idea or a bad idea?
I mean, I would be fine with it
that's just a small planet on the moon
I think they should have a way to tell the difference
Jerma you’re gonna get banned for this
jerma just don't put the game on your stream
i love that he's just holding it for himself
that's what you get for being a really nice guy
What's the deal with the "can i get a fahy" thing
you should have a new console for every game you play
@Jerma985 you are now a slave to the jerma985
you should do a 3d sculpting stream where you will make a movie
@Jerma985 he has to be in a building to be seen
i can't wait for the "the wimpy guys" meme
how are you doing that you're too slow
@Jerma985 It's a new game for you, Jerma.
imagine having a baby and getting a new baby
@Jerma985 Did you ever learn how to use a game controller?
LUL it's like a videogame where you're just a character
@Jerma985 You're gonna need to find the other exit
i have no idea what a game is
@Jerma985 you can do the full face
@Jerma985 you need to watch the vod for the vod
@Jerma985 you're gonna be playing this for the next 3 hours
He's still playing the game after this LUL
I just got here, what is this?
so many of you have never played this game
I like how you're just acting like you're a kid
jerma, you should stop playing this game to relax
You have to be in the middle of a war
Why is everyone on a weekly basis so obsessed with anime?
i have a dream about you :)
I'm gonna go to bed and wake me up
That's what I'd say if I were you
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 i swear to god if this doesn't start it's gonna be a riot
@Jerma985 can you do the voice acting for this?
@Jerma985 Do you think you're supposed to use the flashlight?
"I'm going to spend this money" - jerma985
@Jerma985 You should get a shot of water in the back
@Jerma985 Just like a hundred years ago, you need to play the game
I can't believe you're still playing this game LUL
I don't think you need to go down the stairs
if you get hit by a car you're already dead
i think its a bit of a secret LUL
@Jerma985 you can have a skeleton, it's in your inventory
jermaSun jermaSun i love you jermaHeart jermaHeart
He's going to play with you for 2 hours
@Jerma985 did you see the new gen 2 game?
@Jerma985 play the shit song from "The Thing"
i dont want to be the one to watch you play it
@Jerma985 you have to let go of the controller before you can use it
Jerma you have to hold the trigger to aim
I dont think the song is actually the song
You can do the full face when you're in the room
The Simpsons Hit and Run OST is better than this
@Jerma985 you are supposed to have a baby
@Jerma985 go back to the arcade and get a banana
@Jerma985 You have to put the controller back in the original, otherwise it will get stuck
You should be able to do that :)
@Jerma985 It's a good game, not a good idea
You are a good streamer, you're the best :)
why are you wearing a suit for this
@Jerma985 you need to go to the next area
i hope he's not gonna play this again
@Jerma985 You need
====================
@Jerma985 you can't run off the roof if you're not a civilian
You're not supposed to take damage with your tank
I just want to watch Jerma play the game
@Jerma985 I just joined the stream, did you see the new one?
I just got here, did he kill the jedi yet?

====================
You know, I'm a big fan of the "subs" thing, and I think it's really cool. I'm gonna start donating to a streamer and he'll get angry and say "subs" in my face.
I bet Jerma is not even kidding about the Giant rat
@Jerma985 You're doing the same thing with the DMC2/DLC
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
i dont think that is how it feels
imagine not being able to do that if you have to
Is it just me or does he look like a kid from a cartoon
I was so excited for this game, it's not even that bad
when did you get that slimy shirt from your dad?
oh my god, is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
@Jerma985 Get the motorcycle and get your first gift sub
imagine not being able to play this game
you're doing a great job at this game
i think it was a bit too much
I love how Jerma doesn't realize how much he's fallen in love with chat
You're making me want to watch the carnival stream
Theres no way I can get past this
@Jerma985 if you cant beat the game you're a boomer
this is gonna be a long stream :)
you have to use the menu to control it
Jerma, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be doing this again next year
I have to get this game before i can legally download it
@Jerma985 you can turn the sound off and on again
I had a dream about Jerma and he got knocked out
he said he would stream in the next 2 hours
that guy looks like he's got a pogona
LUL no, you're not. Just like the old man
they just like to get their hands on it
this is the music you can hear when you're not looking
jerma is the one who got the money
@Jerma985 I think it was a joke about the shortness of the stream
@Jerma985 do you know what a dick looks like?
I'm not here for the boomer stream jermaPluto
I have a bad feeling about this game
I think you have to have a shitty score to play the game
@Jerma985 Your character is the worst looking character
if you are going to do that then why do you have to do it with a text on screen?
JERMA PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP IM TRYING TO KEEP IT REAL
@Jerma985 you can get a little more hair on the face
@Jerma985 are you playing as the Tango Frog?
I don't think you can just walk around the area in a straight line
This is the best stream of the year
he will never play this game again PepeHands
@Jerma985 I'm gonna try and get some water
you can't even get to the menu for the boat
"I'm gonna go to sleep" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 it's not gonna be like that it's gonna be a movie night
I don't think it's a joke, it's not a bad thing
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get it with the controller
I can't believe jerma's not a streamer right now
@Jerma985 i'm sorry, i didn't know you were a streamer
@Jerma985 You can't just put a shirt on
it's the same exact thing every time jerma says "SHEETO"
@Jerma985 What do you think of the show?
@Jerma985 When you said you'd play the game I thought you were joking
jermaChomp YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE CHAT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAKES THE MEMES
He's gonna have to stop streaming in the middle of this
i'm gonna go to sleep and wake up and have a good night
why is there a vroomer in the background
@Jerma985 the poor michael could've just stopped the car and just been there
@Jerma985 just dont get in the way of it
@Jerma985 You should add some custom emotes to the top left
i thought he was talking about the super secret level
YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR OWN, JERMA
What's the most your life has ever taken?
@Jerma985 You can click on the screen and press the buttons
i dont think that's how it feels
LUL this game is just like 2 hours
the only time this game has been played is on ps2
@Jerma985 I'm gonna take a nap please don't do this
He'll be playing the song 'Rabbit Hole'
@Jerma985 I think you're supposed to cut the water,
====================
https://youtu.be/kFQlH9sIiM
you have to go back to the elevator
@Jerma985 What if you're a rat and you're playing this?
This is just the start of the game :)
jermaPluto Jerma, you have to start over.
I'm going to take a shower and have a drink
I can't believe he beat this game in one sitting
i cant wait to see this happen :)
This is the most unprofessional way to spoil a good game
You can only get this game on Xbox One
@Jerma985 you can't say that to me Jeremy.
You should just start the stream right now
I think we need to have a poll for that
@Jerma985 You have to leave the hospital to get a new weapon
@Jerma985 Don't be a slave to the system
imagine not having a Jerma sub jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You can't have a pet like this
@Jerma985 "Why is the camera on the bottom left of the screen?"
i can't wait for jerma to play the new game :)
this is like when a kid plays with a controller for a whole day
I just got here what the hell is happening
this is a good game. its not a bad game
Chat is like a bunch of fucking angry people
@Jerma985 are you sure you aren't the person who said you were the bad guy?
@Jerma985 the guy from china is a monkey
this is just the first part of a childrens game
imagine having a good time and not getting the full experience
this game is just a retelling of a classic film
its like the devil is in your room
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the Animal Crossing stream?
what about the movie night? :) i just got here
@Jerma985 can you do the last mission with the first enemy
you are playing a game where you can't control the game.
@Jerma985 you can do it and you can do it!
you can't just play the game, you have to do the mission
the power is coming from inside you
I just got here what the hell is this
@Jerma985 you should have told us you were doing a "weird" joke
@Jerma985 I just got here, is it ok to make fun of me for being late?
@Jerma985 You can make a soundboard with the audio clips
@Jerma985 what if you were to eat the food
@Jerma985 There is no way you can do it
I'm not sure if you can trust me...
@Jerma985 this is the worst joke I've ever seen
This is a good game, I'm not sure I can be disappointed
@Jerma985 the whole house is in the shower
@Jerma985 PLEASE CHANGE THE STREAM TO VIRTUAL LAND
@Jerma985 you're supposed to make a funny video about you
@Jerma985 you're gonna get a haircut and the hair will be a full month old
@Jerma985 you can do a real short stream
@Jerma985 Just got back from the doctor. Your eyes hurt
@Jerma985 can you play the game again please
@Jerma985 the rest of the stream is actually just a fever dream
it's like the thing from the bible
@Jerma985 why did you have to put that on?
the wind is going to kill him LUL
@Jerma985 you can't just say you're bad at it
the joke is getting old, my favorite is the "Jerma is a zombie" joke
I'm not sure you can do it Jerma
@Jerma985 You can't get a secret car that is blue
I'd like to see you play a game of duck and the chain.
@Jerma985 don't let me get to the bottom of this
jermaPluto he has no idea what a god is
Jerma you can't say "This is my house"
@Jerma985 did you see the new Jerma game?
this is the part where the body is out of body
I've seen that video and it's pretty good
jerma is a gamer, he just doesn't have the money
@Jerma985 play the first game, it's free :)
@Jerma985 you need to eat the food first
I'm gonna be honest, I'm pretty sure you have to do the one thing that makes it go faster
He's not gonna get the 5th one PepeHands
@Jerma985 I've been waiting for you to do that
@Jerma985 Jerma, it's the dark side of the galaxy
i would love to see you play this again
you gotta be patient
====================
In case you're wondering, this is the guy who beat the final boss of Dark Souls 3 on stream
It's a bit hard to watch because it's just an anime
what if you dont get the message right in the first 30 seconds?
@Jerma985 you have to start a new game
@Jerma985 You can't be in a place where you don't have a bath tub
yeah but i like the game more than the characters
I don't think you can run in this game
@Jerma985 theres a hole in the floor that goes in the bottom left of the screen
@Jerma985 You have to kill the troll first.
@Jerma985 remember when you said you would play as the goblin?
i'm on my phone right now and i still cant get the stream over
This is the streamer that died to pinwheel
you can't have more than 1 character in a row
@Jerma985 can you do the catatonic pain scream?
Did you put the video on the internet?
@Jerma985 Why do you not have a 2nd Jerma
Chat has Bashed 519 Seagulls, use !bash to help DarkMode
the rat is a sex toy, it's not a movie
it's because you're a child, you're not allowed to do it in this game
its like the first one in the series
@Jerma985 what do you think of the other two
I think I've been the only one to use it
yeah its a bit hard to watch because it's just an anime
@Jerma985 you need to move the camera to the right
@Jerma985 you can actually play a lot of games in this game
i mean you could just play it like a normal game
you can use the drawstrings to pull up to the top of the ladder
jerma you need to stop this game from getting too scary
this is the same guy who said "wtf" on stream
oh man I love the smell of ass
@Jerma985 he's just an old man, he's been on for awhile
The last 2 times I've been here, it's been terrible
@Jerma985 you need to turn the light on and off
@Jerma985 I am so glad you're playing this

====================
EVERY TIME YOU GET A CORNER CLICK ON THE FINGERS
@Jerma985 You need to upgrade your armor to make it stronger
This is what happens when you don't know how to speak
It was a terrible dream for the rest of us jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You could have put the little glass on the ground to protect your head from the rain
you don't have to say "I love you"
@Jerma985 I can't believe you missed the jup joke
I remember hearing that shit from a friend who is a fan of you
@Jerma985 you should play the game that you have a problem with :)
@Jerma985 do you have any of your own equipment?
@Jerma985 you can't buy it in the shop
He's got his own asshole to grind on
@Jerma985 put the body in the dumpster and put it on a tray
i think they're actually doing a different thing
@Jerma985 I think you have to be a lot more experienced to do that

NOTHING IN THE WORLD IS GOOD FOR YOU
This is what happens when you don't have the money
@Jerma985 you're going to be playing a game about a circus
@Jerma985 I like this game, i just wanna see the vod

Why do you always think he's going to die
@Jerma985 play the other game for the next hour
I'm gonna miss the whole stream. Do you guys know what happened?
@Jerma985 why are you going to the bathroom LUL
there is a reason you were never able to get past the first level
@Jerma985 it's the whole stream, it's just the bits
@Jerma985 Jerma, you're not a real streamer, you're a figment of our imagination
I can't believe he's actually gonna play this game
@Jerma985 what did you do to that lady
He's been gone for almost 5 hours, time to wake up
@Jerma985 This is the hardest level in the game
my cat is running out of food jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Just hold the crosshair down and just click it
I've had a lot of bad experiences with this game.
@Jerma985 did you ever think you'd be playing this?
Jerma you need to get in the game
You need to use your TEE to go in the ballpit
i dont know how to do a jup
@Jerma985 have you tried making your own in blender?
my mom is a big fan of jerma and she says its my favorite stream
SourPls omg its me I'm in the mood SourPls
jerma i'm on my phone right now and i just got back from the dentist

you can't stop the vroomer from killing the mayor
@Jerma985 play the music for the first time
@Jerma985 You can't leave the house after you've been in the basement
@Jerma985 So you know you can do this in the first place?
THEY ARENT ONE GUY. IT'S ALL IN THE COMPUTER
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this game?
@Jerma985 you can press alt+f4 to zoom in
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this game
"Cult of the night" - Jerma, 2006
@Jerma985 Do you think that the police will be on your end?
@Jerma985 So you're a "fan" and a "game journalist"?
@Jerma985 You are playing the game that we are all fans of.
@Jerma985 go to the boat and grab the top rope
@Jerma985 You can't use the fov to see the safety
JERMA I HAVE TO GO TO THE DINNER
@Jerma985 I'm going to do some research on your current state of mind, and I can't wait to watch you play this game
this is the most amazing game you've ever played
@Jerma985 is this the guy that died to pinwheel?
I think you should have a costume and a backpack
@Jerma985 You can use the crosshair to hide behind a tree to avoid getting hit by a car
jerma will never be able to play this game jermaPluto
He can't be playing the game because he has a Twitch account
@Jerma985 you can't see your feet in the dark
I'm gonna say it like it's my first time here and I can't stop laughing
why is he playing the game that we are all fans of
@Jerma985 You can play as the dog if you're a furry
i cant wait for the next green screen night
@Jerma985 can you tell me what happened? i need to know
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
this is the most frustrating and horrifying game ever
Jerma is the type of guy that would die to pinwheel
the first hour is still one of the funniest moments in the entire stream
@Jerma985 i'll be your best friend if you do that :)
I hope it's not a fallout new vegas stream
this game is just a pain in the ass
@Jerma985 you have to wait for him to do it
Jerma, are you going to play the new Half-Life?
you can't just take the green instead of the yellow
is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
the sound effects are so damn good
@Jerma985 "I am now officially a sub"
I don't think it's possible for people to be able to see that
@Jerma985 You're supposed to play
====================
Man this is literally the only thing that makes sense
i can't believe i'm watching the streamer that got addicted to gambling
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you get too high
@Jerma985 you're the only person I've ever met that doesn't have an anxiety disorder
what if you just stand still and you have to jump
He’s gonna stream for 6 hours and then he’s gonna stream for 3 hours
@Jerma985 can we get some pottery in the chat
jermaOld i have the same problems as you jermaOld
I think he just said that you have to get the other door
I can't wait for the next Jerma Rumble!
I'm a Jerma fan and I love you all
Jerma, you've been streaming for an hour, this is the stream you've been doing all night. We've been watching you for over an hour and you've been streaming for over an hour.
you have to get the other door first, then the other door
@Jerma985 I think you've been hit by a car

why are you doing this to yourself? @Jerma985
this is like if you were playing as a kid and you just didn't know what a game was

if you have an attack, you need to attack it
i cant believe he actually beat the first level
@Jerma985 I would really like to see you play it
I was in a bathroom and it was on the way to the bathroom
how did you get your bathwater? @Jerma985
you can actually climb up to the top
@Jerma985 I think you need to level up your armor
I think you need to do the following at once, you can only do it once
You need to go back to the beginning
How are you still doing this the same way?
you just gave the baby a shotgun LUL
JERMA STOP PLAYING THIS AND DONT PLAY IT ON STREAM
@Jerma985 It's called the "Ace of All Time"
Jerma you're going to get a massive sword
you need to kill it first try
Jerma, you need to go to the body shop
you dont need to use the car to get the money
i just woke up and the cat is still on the floor jermaPluto
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sorry.
@Jerma985 You need to use your powers to reach the last level.
my uncle has a few funko pops and i'm excited to see what he can do with them
i mean it's not even a really good game
@Jerma985 why do you think the camera is in the middle
I just got here, is he actually playing this?
I just got here, is he playing the new game or is he just playing this game for a few hours?
i can't wait for the game to get made
@Jerma985 Just play the game for the rest of the stream
this is the streamer that beat pinwheel on stream jermaVenus
I can't wait to see Jerma get killed by a police dog
@Jerma985 You should do the same thing for the other guy
@Jerma985 use the PIKATO ON THE MUSHROOM PLEASE

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 what a nice jup jermaJup3 jermaJup4
it's like they're all the same person
@Jerma985 You can't just do the first part without moving
@Jerma985 I think you need to do the last part.
this game is just a bunch of characters talking in a small room with no lights
@Jerma985 You have to get a small version of the new one
this is the guy that beat the first level of dark souls on stream
I like how the old man is just still sitting there
I got here when it was just the old man
@Jerma985 Did you just hear the sound of the lizard being tortured?
You need to change the wii to the new one
it's really nice to have a space cadet
@Jerma985 just do a video of a guy farting and screaming
@Jerma985 why do you need the ice cream cone
Jerma I think you're a good gamer, do what you gotta
you can't buy a new house if you don't own it
@Jerma985 Can you do a tier list? :)
I know he's playing it, but the sound effect is a bit off
There
====================
How are you still doing the voice lines?
@Jerma985 you should do a "I just ate a shoe" joke
@Jerma985 I don't think you know what a mouse is
@Jerma985 please show the person who did the voice
how do you think a robot would react if its in a movie
This is a real stream, Jerma is the super streamer
We're gonna be here for a while, you guys are gonna be here for a while
I'm glad you didn't miss the last minute of the stream
so what's the name of this game? I'm just curious
i don't think it's that bad, it's just that it's really hard to get a good picture of someone in the game
@Jerma985 you don't have to take a photo of the person you're replacing
@Jerma985 just go into the game menu and press f1
is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 ON STREAM?
@Jerma985 i know you're just playing as a joke and i feel bad for you
@Jerma985 look at the top of the screen, it shows you the color and what the hell you're doing
you need to beat him to get a free skill
I'm gonna go play some vr and i'm gonna have to put on some video games
jerma if you make this game you can’t do it
@Jerma985 you need to get a better weapon to beat this boss
@Jerma985 you can't make the same mistake twice LUL
@Jerma985 i remember when you were a kid, you would literally do a shit ton of dumb stuff and just go for the top of the tower
@Jerma985 if you just throw rocks at the enemies, they'll have to be stunned
Shelby you need to clean the floors and not the bathroom
why are the zombies in this game so big?
I'm waiting for the next Jerma stream :)
i think you can just shoot the thing

I have no idea what the fuck is going on
I'm going to be honest, I'm just surprised he's still streaming
i have no idea what the fuck is going on
YOU CAN GET THE SAME ONE FROM BONES
@Jerma985 Are you going to play Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo DS?
@Jerma985 You're going to have to finish the game
@Jerma985 Are you going to do the "You're gonna have a big dick" joke again?
why is he so mad about this game
this is just the evolution of the stream
You have to do the same thing as the first guy
@Jerma985 can you not do a Jerma stream
@Jerma985 Just joined the stream, what the hell is going on?
this is the most boring thing i have ever seen
i dont know what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 you have to get a key to get the shire
@Jerma985 You can't just run in and have a free time
@Jerma985 can you do a jerma rumble stream?
Jerma is the one who makes all of the rules
you just ruined your own stream with that joke
I’m sorry that you’ve been playing this for 8 hours, but I love you Jerma
@Jerma985 You can still do it if you're an adult
@Jerma985 Do you plan on playing the next game?
@Jerma985 if you do it, you will be better than the other one
@Jerma985 You should play a game where you just beat it and it's just your own level
@Jerma985 It's really hard to get the sub sound
i love how the game just makes you look like the character
@Jerma985 Did you ever get your prime sub?
@Jerma985 you have to stop the tractor
"I need to take my shower" - Jerma985
jermaOtto "You can't just shoot me" jermaOtto
@Jerma985 do you think theres a fucking PENIS IN THE DUMMY
@Jerma985 you can't die from a dream joke

This is a copypasta of a movie
@Jerma985 you are a fucking sociopathic streamer, you need to be held accountable
jermaPluto yeah, it's been a while since i've seen that
@Jerma985 Jerma, I just got here and you are already talking about a game called Sonic Mania?
there is a way to get to the moon
@Jerma985 you're the one who made all of the rules
I just got here why are you so angry
@Jerma985 this is why you're late. we're gonna get the chat meltdown
is this the streamer who beat MGS 2 on stream?
@Jerma985 The blue part is the last one
i'm not a nerd but i hate this game
@Jerma985 Can you do a comedy stream? :)
@Jerma985 you can throw the weapon up to the ceiling
it's just like the game itself, you get to throw the coin
@Jerma985 I'm a moron I'm going to be honest
the music is great, but it's just the sound of a car
He has to do the right side
it's a dogshit stream, but the whole game is just the dogshit
Jerma is so cool and we all love him jermaHeart
im gonna have to go to sleep but i will catch up
i'm not sure if its gonna be hard to get the video
I can't believe he's playing this on his own stream
@Jerma985 You are the only one that can fix the world
@Jerma985 you know a lot of people have to work on the internet because they don't have internet and they can't afford to
@Jerma985 The dumbest shit I've seen in a long time
Why are you doing this to us jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You're gonna get a headache from that
jerma you have to put your phone on the toilet
I cant believe i missed the first hour of this stream
@Jerma985 you can't just punch the guy with the stick
I thought the stream was over before it started
I love how the game just makes you feel like you're the one playing this
how do you know you're not a gamer
@Jerma985 you are playing a game that you played a long time ago and it's a huge asshole
that's the only thing i can think of
I think it's a little too dark for me
I just got here, why are you
====================
One of my favorite characters is voiced by the guy from viva pinata.
This game is so much better than the last one
@Jerma985 You can buy the DLC from the Borderlands store, it's a DLC for the DLC
@Jerma985 They're called 'The Flaming Balls', they're the enemies from the new Scooby Doo movie
@Jerma985 can you not have a "he said "he said" in your stream title
This is the streamer that will be the next president of the united states
I would love to see the evil one in the kingdom of Jerma
@Jerma985 I did it to get the best ending.
@Jerma985 you have to go to the other end of the road
this is the end of the stream in real life
I think this is the best game ever made
why would you want to build this over the castle
@Jerma985 You need to beat the final boss
He's gonna lose his mind if he doesn't get to the end
I hope this is the last stream he's having
@Jerma985 when are you going to do the "what the fuck" joke again?
@Jerma985 i think its a week or two ago
@Jerma985 you have to shoot them in the head with the shotgun
@Jerma985 You need to save the princess, she is the only one who gets to leave.
@Jerma985 this is a joke, i wont be able to tell what the joke is
@Jerma985 When you see a guy with a mustache, try to punch him
this is the most chaotic stream i have ever seen
Is this the guy who beat the first boss of Dark Souls?
@Jerma985 you need to take out the trash and put it back on
I'm only here for the winks, don't tell me you won't see that
@Jerma985 why did you play that simpsons hit and run game for 5 hours
@Jerma985 you can click the button to move
i cant believe this is the guy who beat the first boss of dark souls on stream
you dont have to do it right you just need to do it the right way
@Jerma985 Put your face on the green screen and say "he"
Is this the streamer that beat the first boss of dark souls?
@Jerma985 There's a secret boss in the basement that's not gonna let you get to the roof
SourPls WE NEED TO SEE HIM IN THE WATER SourPls
@Jerma985 YOU CAN GET MORE THAN 10 BITS
you know, the one with a good soundtrack
I just got back. What the hell happened?
why are there so many of these
@Jerma985 how much do you pay for this game?
I've never been to a jerma stream, have you ever heard of this site?
@Jerma985 You need to go to the secret section
I can't believe Jerma is a fucking adult now
@Jerma985 do you think you have a bathroom key?
@Jerma985 You need to go back to the boat
I don't know, can you actually play this?
@Jerma985 Just keep going and get better results
@Jerma985 you should add an "A L E N T" emote
Chat is a bunch of fucking fucking idiots
@Jerma985 You have to go to the top
I'm gonna be honest, I don't think this is a good idea.
Oh my god why does it sound like a dog
@Jerma985 You can have a good time with the "fuzz"
@Jerma985 I think you can get better results from the other character
@Jerma985 the game is an adaptation of a book
@Jerma985 The stream was in the background when you were talking about how you would never play this game again
chat has gone too far in the direction of "triggered"
i cant believe theres a ytch on the main channel
This is the streamer who beat the first boss of dark souls
I have no idea what's going on
@Jerma985 what do you think of your own scuffed jokes?
@Jerma985 when is the next jerma rumble?
imagine a seagull that wants to be a sub
Why are you still playing this game LUL
@Jerma985 What's up, Jerma? I have to go to work soon
@Jerma985 you can't make a giant robot like that
@Jerma985 The Thing is a song from the movie
@Jerma985 He's going to get a heart attack from that
I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not.
I'm not a fucking idiot. I'm not even a sub.
@Jerma985
====================
Jerma has never played a game before
I got a bunch of fucking porn on my computer and I just wanted to send it to Jerma
jerma you need to watch the video where you talk about how you're gonna be streaming for 3 hours and then stream for 6 hours
@Jerma985 Just wait until you're at the end of the ride
@Jerma985 what's the name of the game?
oh yeah that's a really bad idea LUL
I love how the second one just takes up all of the space
@Jerma985 Are you the new Jerma985? I didn't know you were a good boy
this guy is a fraud jermaPluto he's not going to be able to afford the rent
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're the only one to die
@Jerma985 I'm a fucking idiot, I'm too young to know.
i'm gonna play this game again in a week
you can't make a game for children, it's too easy for you
you need to find the money to keep your house from burning down
he's not even gonna get to the boss
@Jerma985 do you want to play the game again?
@Jerma985 you're gonna be playing it for the rest of the stream
@Jerma985 I'm having an existential crisis right now and I just want to be able to go home and be happy :)
Why are you playing this game with a fucking fidget spinner?
I like that there's a fucking coin in the middle of the screen
@Jerma985 Why is the random guy in the beginning of the movie
jermaOld HE'S A STREAMER I CAN'T STOP IT
@Jerma985 I don't think that's how you do it
@Jerma985 The joke is that you're not watching the stream
@Jerma985 please keep it up jerma i can't sleep
@Jerma985 You have to do a 100% slime joke
Jerma please don't go in the water, it's going to be so annoying
I just got here and he's still talking about the toilet?
@Jerma985 Jerma, the devs of this game said it would be a waste of time
i wish i could get a jerma rumble jermaPluto
@Jerma985 What the fuck are you talking about?
@Jerma985 What is your opinion on the anime version of this game?
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game with a kid?
jermaPop what is this game I'm watching right now
I'd pay to see you play it jerma
@Jerma985 You have to use the item in the chest
I have a memory of when I was a kid
why do you have a small voice changer
if you don't put it on, you're just doing it wrong
why are you doing this to us @Jerma985
@Jerma985 Please be quiet, my sister's boyfriend is a doctor.
@Jerma985 you can't just buy it on amazon
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game with a kid?
hey jerma i just got back from work and i got a really bad migraine
@Jerma985 The camera in this game is a little small
@Jerma985 hey jerma, im gonna go get some sleep. i need you to stop streaming for me, i feel really sick and can't do it without you.
@Jerma985 you said you were gonna start at 2pm
You have to pay the toll on the interstate
@Jerma985 I have the lowest score of any streamer
@Jerma985 why is this game on a wall
i think that's how you get more money
I mean, I'm glad to be a part of a society that has made no progress
You're not supposed to be in the middle of a fight
Jerma, I've been watching your stream since the day I was born
I'm just saying this is a mess
@Jerma985 you're gonna get a streamer license if you dont win
@Jerma985 make a tier list for the next stream
This is a great game, Jerma. You should do it.
just not the 2nd one that's just an xbox controller
@Jerma985 Put the phone in the bathtub
@Jerma985 The only thing you can do is make the water around the house a little cooler and put it in the bathtub
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the wrong answer LUL
@Jerma985 put the gas pedal on the first row
i hope this is a real time stream
@Jerma985 "I'm gonna eat a shoe" jermaSun
I'll never forget the time Jerma was in chat, he said "no"
@Jerma985
====================
The government has not even mentioned the new Star Wars trailer yet
@Jerma985 play a game of your own game
my guess is that the people who are going to be watching this stream are going to be the ones that don't know the game
jermaOld i wasnt born in the middle of the night
jermaPop I'm a JermaPop and I'm proud of you jermaHeart
jermaWalk PUT THESE GAMES OUT OF THEIR MISERY jermaWalk
Jerma's gonna make a video on this game and then he'll be late
The new Jerma game is so good that it's worth buying it
SourPls THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR MONEY
This is a very angry guy, I'm sorry
is this the streamer that killed his own dog?
I know this is a boring game but this is an extremely engaging one.
@Jerma985 You can hold R to clear the lava
@Jerma985 You can only get the weapon at the end of the level
@Jerma985 The next boss is a different kind of boss
The last one has a more annoying sound effect than the other one
@Jerma985 when you die you have to make a new one
You have to wait until you are at the end
jermaWalk the game is gonna be over in like 30 minutes
jermaWalk i would like to be a sub
you need to let go of the gun
It's the 2nd jerma stream in a row jermaVenus
i like how jerma is trying to figure out how to draw
I think you just don't want to get hit by the first guy
LUL I like how Jerma is trying to figure out how to draw the "WII"
This is the first time I've seen this stream
you have to put the thing under the table
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA, GO TO THE STATION
@Jerma985 its okay you're a good streamer, just dont beat this game
This game is so easy to make, you can't even make it in 3D
@Jerma985 It's like the "Jerma is the only streamer with a well-written essay due in 10 years" joke
Jerma you can't make me stay up all night to watch your streams
If you're a real gamer you have to do what you think is best
@Jerma985 You have to get in the middle of the track
@Jerma985 use your old farting skills to become the next Jerma
i think he was just gonna say "i don't have time"
Hey jerma, did you ever play a game that was just called "japanese"
You can't even tell if your dad is in there
the best part of the movie is the little kids showing up
You need to hit the bottom of the platform
@Jerma985 I just wanted to say that I love you man
i cant believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 It was just a house flipper boss
i just watched the vod on youtube and it was really cool
@Jerma985 YOU WERE IN A MOTHERFUCKING PLACE YOU DAD
I thought the game was playing ads for like 5 seconds
guys stop counting the first letter of the alphabet
jermaOld jermaOld i dont get it, it's just a huge ass
The only thing that’s not bad is the fact that you have to restart the game
Jerma, when did you get a diaper? I'm concerned for your health
@Jerma985 this is the first time I've ever seen this stream
Can you imagine if you had a small kitchen in a high school
I'm just here to see the game, but I'm just here to see the reactions
@Jerma985 you need to get to the town
i can't wait for the end of this game
what if we kissed in the shower and we were in the shower
Jerma, do you know how to draw the "WII"
I just got back what the hell happened
@Jerma985 I think you need to be in the water
i love how this streamer is trying to make the water taste like garbage
oh my god this is so funny LUL
HES GONNA LOSE IT ALL THE TIME
I love how Jerma is trying to figure out how to draw the "WII"
@Jerma985 they had to make a new one to do this
jermaWalk YOU'RE GOING TO GET COLD jermaWalk
@Jerma985 You need to be able to tell when the zombie is the boss
i wouldnt be able to watch this stream without a t-pose
Jerma, do you know if you can get the DLC?
@
====================
PlasmaReaper @Jerma985 you have to take your time and not get bored
why are you wearing a diaper on the toilet
is it really that bad if you have a hard time catching up on the streams?
JERMA PLAYS A NEW GAME THAT I CAN'T WATCH
@Jerma985 You got to work, you didn't get to play this game.
I have a very high IQ, I'm so glad to see you succeed
jerma you are a "the internet" streamer, you should be banned from all streams
@Jerma985 get a new fucking car in the garage
I'm so proud of you Jerma, I can't wait to see what you do next
@Jerma985 You need to do this in the tutorial
@Jerma985 you have to do the "I'm never coming back" joke again
@Jerma985 You can't put a bounty on a dead body
I just got back from the bathroom and you're still doing the game?
I'm gonna be honest, I've never seen this game before
This is what it feels like to be a Jerma985
@Jerma985 you're gonna make a lot of money
@Jerma985 You need to go back to the first level, it's a secret level
He's going to have to do another dumb joke
I have to say I like the first part of this game
@Jerma985 How long did you have to do to get to the top
you have to read the entirety of the book, then ask a question
@Jerma985 What if you were to be a bot?
chat just wants to be friends and not be the weirdo
@Jerma985 what happened to your webcam? i thought you were doing it wrong
@Jerma985 You're playing a game that has no context
this is like a real life version of the game, only worse
Jerma you know you need to play on your own time
I think he said he was gonna do another vod.
@Jerma985 you have to do a really big red red sign, it's not a typo
this game is so boring. its almost as if it's been 5 hours
@Jerma985 You can do the "I'm never coming back" joke again.
@Jerma985 if you do it, you can do it
I wouldnt be surprised if you're a gamer
I'm gonna put the coffee in your mouth
i cant believe hes playing this game
@Jerma985 you're in the same spot that you were in last time
did you hear that they are being tortured
You can't have sex with a cow in the game
there's a second stream on the other day
@Jerma985 you need to get a soundboard of the music
this is just a true story of a guy who was born with a bald spot
that's why you have to make a bad joke
@Jerma985 i just got a new laptop for my work
@Jerma985 Theres a really good version of this game on Steam
@Jerma985 you have to go through the portal to the north
I like this game so much but its too easy for me
@Jerma985 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 are you a mod or a modded streamer?
@Jerma985 Please go to the end of the level
@Jerma985 hey guys, you just got a new job, can we get a sponsorship? :)
@Jerma985 is the other one your brother from the discord?
you're gonna lose your mind playing this game
@Jerma985 You can put a load of money in your pocket to pay for the lottery ticket.
@Jerma985 I have a feeling you've been following along.
you know you'd be a good streamer, right?
@Jerma985 I think the L I C A S
@Jerma985 can you explain the title and then tell us what happened
there's a pretty good game on steam called "The Thing"
If you kill the birds you get the food
If I were a rat I'd just be a clown
If you are a rat, you can't be a rat.
what the fuck is wrong with this dude
@Jerma985 Your stream is just getting more and more boring
@Jerma985 Have you ever thought about making a 5th wall?
@Jerma985 im sorry for making you play this
@Jerma985 you can make an actual snake just by selling it
Jerma you're gonna get the wrong taste in the microwave
@Jerma985 You can see the top of the screen
@Jerma985 you have to turn off the radio to get it
@Jerma985 Did you know that the second phase is a very small boss fight?
chat is just going to be
====================
WITH YOUR BOOTS YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're not a billionaire
I think he needs to wear a hat, not a wig
I'm not sure how to react to the "jerma is a robot"
@Jerma985 I think you need to put the slingshot on your face and then put it in the tank
@Jerma985 I'm watching you play the game, can you do the voice again?
why would you make a park in this game
@Jerma985 you should change the music so theres an echo effect
I'm going to go to sleep now. Have fun Jerma.
i have no idea what to do with myself
@Jerma985 you can do the same with a fart
You can't just get a fortnite villager and grow into a tall man

You know what is going to happen after you're done
JERMA YOU ARE IN THE PIPE FOR THE LAST TIME

@Jerma985 There's no way you're still doing this, it's literally the last boss
I can't believe Jerma is late to the stream
"How many people did you eat in a row"
you need to go to the kitchen and eat it
@Jerma985 You can't save at the end of the game
@Jerma985 I think you need to save the chibi robo
@Jerma985 do you know what a game is?
Jerma, I don't think you need to be so invested in this game. You'll get better at this game when you start playing
@Jerma985 Your character is on the boat you cant tell what's going on
I know, I just came in here to say I'm a Jerma fan
I'm a Jerma fan, and I love how Jerma is always the first person to say something positive about a stream
@Jerma985 you can buy your own food in the store, it's the only thing you need
@Jerma985 Please don't spoil the whole game for anyone else
@Jerma985 It's just a joke, I'll get it later

You're playing the game wrong, you're gonna die.
"it's a guy in his 50s" - Jerma985

@Jerma985 You need to give the children to the police.
If you don't get the boots, you're gonna have to do another level.
imagine how hard it would be to get your child to play a game
@Jerma985 No one would be watching this, why would they watch you
@Jerma985 You can use the earth and moon to find a planet
I wish I could give you a kidney, but I can't
this game is amazing, but the fact that it was made in 2011 makes it even better
you can go to a restaurant and have a lunch with the chef
I'm not sure what I'm looking at. Is it a game or a stream?
@Jerma985 It's like the Garden of Eden episode where he gets addicted to all the drugs
Can't believe Jerma's late streamer is playing DOS games
@Jerma985 You can save the game with the book.

@Jerma985 you can hit the enemies to get them to attack
You're the one who said "You can't let the game die"
@Jerma985 it's a very nice game, I don't think you could do it without the tutorial
I think it's called the "Bowl of the Deep" game
@Jerma985 I'm a judge, I can tell you that
@Jerma985 Make a fortnite emote for the stream
its just a vpn for the nerds to see
@Jerma985 you've been playing this for a while now
You can get a better one by letting us know :)
It's like watching someone play a game
@Jerma985 you should put your bank account info on the internet

I thought you were a nice person @Jerma985
I'm just glad that I have the opportunity to watch this stream live
@Jerma985 there are mods who will ban you if you post a link
@Jerma985 you should put the other ones in your future videos
I hope he plays this game for the first time
The only thing that makes me happy is the streams
I'm not sure if I can tell if you're serious or not
I like the game but I can't say anything without spoilers
@Jerma985 You can't just do it in the first place
He can't stop, he's a spy, he's a spy
Is it a good idea to put a live stream on your main channel?
@Jerma985 I'm just kidding, I'm a big fan of the game. It's got a really good soundtrack.
the one where he was talking about something
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to be a real gamer
it's not a joke, it's a real video game
it's a large ship, it's a lot easier to land on the small one

@Jerma985 I think you need to go to the wizard
what happened to the previous one? did he get too close?
I like how Jerma just reads the chat for the entire stream
@Jerma985 if you do it all at once it'll be so much easier
i think you need to get your hair cut before the stream starts
I cant wait to see the next jerma stream
Just like how Jerma just streams for 5 hours straight and doesn't finish.
I feel like this is a pretty good game
What about the ones you skipped? I know they are going to be hard to get
@Jerma985 you have to give the snake a good time

you could be playing something else if you got a job
we're not talking about the game, we're talking about the voice
i love the guys who make the hype train
@Jerma985 please, your voice is not as bad as I think it is

@Jerma985 theres no way you're still playing this
It's so easy to get a bad joke in this game
@Jerma985 you need to raise the price to 100k
@Jerma985 The item you're looking for is a book
Jerma you should play the new game of thrones

Jerma has a broken neck on his shoulders
i can't wait for jerma to beat the game in 1 hour
I'm looking at you, your a funny dude!
@Jerma985 You have to play the game to see the ending
I remember when I played this game, and I didn't know what it was called

Is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel on stream??
@Jerma985 you have to make sure you're not a biter
@Jerma985 Try to get a shot of the fart
"They are my friends. They are my friends"
@Jerma985 you could have left the whole game on the shelf
@Jerma985 This game is a scam to get you to play it on stream
Jerma what the fuck are you doing here
jerma i didnt know you could play this
I was just wondering why you were doing this
if we were actually friends we would be able to make out :)
@Jerma985 you're a terrible actor and you have to do it again
@Jerma985 why are you playing a game that's not in your budget?
the guy who is doing this is a liar
I just got here, how did he beat this boss?
@Jerma985 You should try and kill the boss first
@Jerma985 you have to do the final boss.
@Jerma985 you can do this on the phone
how much money is that guy getting
I'm like 4 years older than you :)

@Jerma985 You have to hold up the mic for this
Oh god, I remember this game from back when I was a kid
i think it's just the same sound effect
they said "we're gonna see you on the street"
@Jerma985 You should try to get a last name before you enter the game
@Jerma985 There's a camera in the middle of the road
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this?
i swear this is what he does to himself
You don't have to change your mind Jerma
so you can be a ghost and not be the ghost
It's just a random shit so you can't just say "it's the exact same thing"
@Jerma985 you can put the wood at the bottom
LUL you're gonna get a lot of tickets, man
I would be in a panic attack if I saw this
@Jerma985 you could have put the gun down and not aim it at the target

Thing I’m hearing is that Jerma is trying to sell the game
If you have to talk to your mother you're a fool
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're playing this game
this is the most disney movie ever made
I'm just gonna say it. It's not like it's bad
oh shit, what the hell is a gamecube
and he's like "OH YEAH THAT'S MY POCKET"
He's literally the only person I'm hearing that wants to see him die
he's gonna have to take a fucking nap tomorrow
how much does the zoomer pay for a sub?
you can just shoot him while he's still in the air
why does this game have a 15 minute slowmode
@Jerma985 can you do the secret cutscene in this game
@Jerma985 you're the only person i trust and I know that you're here
i wish i could see a twitch streamer and not be able to see all the time jermaPluto
that's why the car is in the garage
this is a really nice stream, i like how you are always so happy when you talk to chat about your favorite game :)
The only thing Jerma doesn't want to do is stream the game
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE RIVER TO GET OURSELVES SOME BEE
Jerma should play a game called Super Mario RPG and play it all on a loop
@Jerma985 just look at the title, it's a pretty good one
@Jerma985 I have a feeling it won't be too hard
@Jerma985 you don't have to do this, it's actually just a little bit easier if you're not playing a game
@Jerma985 You have to buy the book to get the secret
why does this game have a 30 minute slow mode?
@Jerma985 you said you were gonna play this for 3 hours
I'm not gonna lie this game is a scam
It's like someone threw a rock at a wall
if i had money to donate to you
@Jerma985 You've been doing this for an hour
I mean you're right it's a robot
I think you're gonna have to take a break
@Jerma985 just put the bike on the boat
You need to learn how to stand up
how is this so hard to see? @Jerma985
I know that the best way is to pretend to be bad at the game and then play it
I'm gonna be honest this was a pretty fun stream
@Jerma985 Can you just put a video of yourself?
@Jerma985 You can't afford a castle in the sky
just a small window to the right side
i'm in an hour i can tell you're in pain
jerma if you don't eat a shoe i will eat a toothpick
@Jerma985 I know you've been playing this game for 10 hours and I know you like it. I just like it.
I think you need to go to the barber shop
Just do it with the money you have in the bank
it's like the intro to an old TV show
imagine not having a good time for a streamer jermaPluto
I'm the one that made that joke LUL
oh my god i just realized he's still in the castle
"I'm gonna be honest, I'm actually pretty good at this game"
@Jerma985 It's too loud for my ears, stop the game
@Jerma985 put the next one in the bottom right
do you know what a moo is? LUL
It's like a gorilla but with a huge head
i bet this guy is going to kill you
you guys know jerma is a real scientist. he's a scientist
@Jerma985 please tell us about the ladder you're in
you dont need to put the boat in the boat
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get to the boss
@Jerma985 The guy is going to get more money
YOU CAN BE A FAN, BUT YOU'RE NOT A PROFESSIONAL
@Jerma985 I got a key to the boat and I can't open it without getting a special thanks
i want to go to bed, but im too busy to do it jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you need to find the secret secret room
its a very unique and fun game, isnt it?
i think you're gonna get stuck in the basement
i hope you get a new shirt :)
i want to go to sleep but i can't get off of bed
Jerma is the bad guy from the Jerma Rumble
YOU CAN'T SEE IT IN THE SWAMP
I'm so glad I'm watching you play this
i was here when jerma died and not the
====================
A bunch of people just watched a vod, and it's funny
@Jerma985 I'll be honest, I didn't realize you had to save your life to get the joke
You need to find the secret room with the secret key
If you die in this game you die in real life
I bet that's how many people who have seen it here on discord
@Jerma985 you can have a jermaDafoe emote in the discord
@Jerma985 im still waiting for the green screen movie night
I want to see you play with the ship in real life
you're not supposed to be a boomer, you're supposed to be an idiot
you can make a whole lot of money off of it

Jerma, I'm sorry but you have to stop now.
@Jerma985 you could put the camera on top of the clouds and it would be nice
@Jerma985 you need to be a little bit more focused
I'm in a small town in the middle of nowhere
@Jerma985 what are you doing to the other people?

@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this game?
@Jerma985 is it me or does your voice sound like my dad
@Jerma985 You need to get some other weapons to be able to do it

Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 36. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 It's a song, it's not an actual game. It's just a joke.
jerma has never played the original mario maker game

@Jerma985 I didn't think you could do this
jerma are you going to play the new game
"I'm going to be here for a while, i'm going to be late"

@Jerma985 are you a real gamer? I've been watching you since you were a kid
Jerma, you've been in the loop for too long
@Jerma985 I like how you're still playing this game
You're supposed to be eating the little steak and putting it out to the side
You can't get a robot to play as you

@Jerma985 you're not a fan of the character creator
@Jerma985 You can't get a good game, the story is too boring
Jerma, I just came back from a walk and I have to get out of the way. Is he still playing this game?
I don't know if you can get a good game
why does he have a penis in a shoe
this is the real reason why jerma is late
@Jerma985 Is it a thing on the internet?
This is a lot more complicated than it looks
that was the most fun thing to happen in this game
@Jerma985 Can you imagine what you get up to
I didn't know you could kill a man with that sword
@Jerma985 that's why you dont have a gun
i thought it was a good thing that the game wasnt
@Jerma985 you can only have two types of monsters
@Jerma985 can you use the soundboard to make a video of the gameplay?
it's all a dream, you're too powerful and I'm gonna have to watch you die
@Jerma985 are you going to play the new games?
The more you get, the more you need to do
@Jerma985 will you play the new games?
It's a good thing you aren't wearing your diaper
@Jerma985 You are supposed to turn on the mic and we can hear your heartbeat
dont look at the other one, he's too close to you
how did you get so close to me
@Jerma985 you can turn off the camera to view the clips
@Jerma985 If you do that, you're legally allowed to leave
@Jerma985 do you have a labo account?
It's literally just a single boss fight, you can't do it
@Jerma985 When you see the "Let's talk about porn" joke, be prepared for the audience to start

jermaOld you look like a kid from the 80s
I can't wait to see Jerma use that bald spot
@Jerma985 The number is on the door you just entered
@Jerma985 it's a currency thing. It's like a currency thing
I know what you're talking about, I'm just a guy in my own head

I'm pretty sure this game is just a fucking dvd player

this is the worst thing that could happen
@Jerma985 you should play some other games and make it a no-go zone
@Jerma985 you can just make a bunch of square tiles with the rail
@Jerma985 YOU CAN PUT GUMMY ON THE SCREEN
i just got here and i cant tell if the game is still working or not

Jerma is the only one who can read
@Jerma985 You can do it again after you beat the boss

@Jerma985 You should do a modded version of this
@Jerma985 You need to get the bell to unlock the secret room
@Jerma985 This is a game of patience, it's not hard
You're just going to get bored of the game
Ster just came in and said you were going to die
@Jerma985 You're the only person on this channel that makes sense
@Jerma985 you gotta do a joke where you play the game
@Jerma985 you can use the sword to jump
That's like the worst thing you can do in a game
@Jerma985 This is a really cool game and it's pretty fun.
you can't even get to the secret boss
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the ps2 version?
@Jerma985 how many times do you have to tell us
I'm gonna get this guy stuck in the car LUL
I love how you just ignore everything and just ignore the rest of the stream
This is a great game. It's got great music and great art
you can literally do a whole playthrough in this game
@Jerma985 why are you just standing there and making it look like a video game
@Jerma985 I'm so glad you're still here.
The whole point of this game is to get a higher skill

@Jerma985 You have to say your name once you're done
JERMA YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE CHAT, THAT'S A BAD IDEA
@Jerma985 the new game looks great, but it's a little too bright
He's a hero, he's in the bathroom! jermaSun
@Jerma985 there's a door to the main hall
I bet you guys have the same expectations for this game as you do for this game.
@Jerma985 its a bad time to
====================
It was a scam, it was a scam that took away a man's sanity
@Jerma985 "I've got the boots, I can't get in"
@Jerma985 I'm gonna be honest, it's not a good game
The man is not a robot, he is a human
its like hes a slow cooker, hes just not cooked
it's like you're driving through a wall
We are the rats. We are the rats, we are the rats
theres no need to do this for me
@Jerma985 you have to stop the stream to find the tree
@Jerma985 you can get a rock to turn it into a head
This is the same guy that beat the game on stream?
@Jerma985 you are the only person I know that has played this game
@Jerma985 You don't need to do this if you already have a life
@Jerma985 How do I use the channel points?
There is a plot twist in this game, the lady turns out to be a serial killer
I just got here what the fuck happened
@Jerma985 Just as you say "My life is going to be hell"
@Jerma985 PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR NAME TO NANCY DREW
@Jerma985 i'm gonna be honest, i'd rather watch you play this game than the viva pinata game
@Jerma985 I heard you hate the game. I love it
no it's not. it's the opposite. it's the opposite of that.
@Jerma985 If you die in the game, you die in real life
if you don't do it tomorrow, i'll leave you with a burning house
I love how the soundtrack is just "cringe noise"
If you had a Kinect you could do a really cool puzzle in this game
jerma you look like a pig, you need to stop
I just got here what the fuck is this
Just got here, what the hell is this game?
Chat has Bashed 183 Seagulls, use !bash to help
I thought you were going to say the dumbest thing ever
@Jerma985 You can shoot in the air to kill him
It's the same thing as when you are in a bar and see a bunch of people
I just got here, why is the streamer so bad
Jerma theres a secret boss in this game
You can't really be a child if you don't have a good time with the game.
@Jerma985 You can't make your own friends, it's not a joke
@Jerma985 you can turn on the stream and still hear the music
I am the only one that loves this game.
@Jerma985 I have a memory card that is just a bunch of shit
this is the best game for a reason
@Jerma985 i can't believe you've been streaming for 15 years
@Jerma985 You know how you make your own toast?
It's like the Drew Crew's joke, they only make jokes about poop
The next episode of Sam and Max is airing right now
@Jerma985 YOU CAN DO IT, TAKE THE MONEY

@Jerma985 can you make your own game? @Jerma985

Hey jerma, I heard you like hot dogs, and I'm wondering what you're eating right now.
Jerma, do you think you have a secret item on your desk

@Jerma985 PLEASE DO A SINGLE GRADE FOR THE JOKER
Chat will never be able to see that the game is really bad
this is like a family coming to terms with their death
You can't die to a level 1 spider
@Jerma985 You can just change it to "I'm not going to be alive for another year"
@Jerma985 you just made a game, it's not on the main channel
Jerma is a short man, he's not gonna be able to fit in with the chat

jermaWalk Aight guys, I gotta go to work! jermaWalk
I like how you have to jump to the top
Jerma you have to admit you're a lot better than I am
@Jerma985 He's not going to beat the game LUL

I've been watching you since you were a kid, you'll always be my favorite.
i wish i had a refund for this
@Jerma985 i think this game is for the PC
@Jerma985 you don't need to make the most of a card

@Jerma985 You need to take a break for your shift
@Jerma985 if you go to the bathroom, make sure to press the button to flush your pants
I need a jerma wink now jermaSun jermaSun
I'm gonna miss this stream, i'm gonna miss this stream jermaPluto
i cant believe jerma is still playing this
theres a lot of sugar in this game
@Jerma985 is this the new metal gear?
This is just the prerecorded stream of you doing a "turn the lights off" joke.
@Jerma985 you have to save some of the mana to do the "reminder" mission
I can't believe this guy beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 what the fuck is that farts and screams thing?
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO HIT THE LEFT BUTTON
There was a reason he went back to the dead
why is he wearing a shirt with a hat on it?
@Jerma985 use the gun in a specific spot
@Jerma985 how did you get a job at a pizza place?
I can't wait to see what you're building in this game
Jerma, you're supposed to take a break from the game and play this for a while
Why is it that you have a hard time
@Jerma985 You're going to get banned for this
@Jerma985 You have to do the thing to the toilet
I can't believe you're still playing this

the audience is going to scream at you when you talk about this
Is this the streamer that got lost in a wall of men?

@Jerma985 i got the first link so i can watch
it's a 4th of July stream, the day before I eat dinner
oh no he's streaming today and he's not streaming today
@Jerma985 The button is in the middle of the screen
he's been drinking since he was 12 jermaPluto
I got a new sub from my mom and my dad, and she called me a "fag" jermaPluto
jerma needs to become a full time streamer
@Jerma985 are you going to play the old video game?
YOURE GONNA GET DRUNK TOO I GUARANTEE
@Jerma985 did you know that jermaWalk is a good emote
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1285. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 You should do a story where you play as a toddler and you have to sell all of your possessions
i just got here and what the fuck is happening
jermaWalk I’ll be live in 5 hours jermaWalk
i hope jerma plays this for the rest of the stream
Jerma was the only one that told you to go to the secret
if you die in the game you die in real life
this is a kid's game, but not a children's game
I think it's gonna be the pre-stream chat
how can we say this isnt a joke
@Jerma985 why did you even bring up the dark souls stream?
this is the most disgusting thing ive ever seen
@Jerma985 dont get into that circle, it's a potential trap
jerma is a hater of the warband genre
you can't run away without getting hit in the head
@Jerma985 you could just buy a ride in the sky
@Jerma985 What are you even doing in the game?
@Jerma985 you have to use the "I didn't say to buy" command
i cant believe the mods are fucking stupid
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1584. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i have a large pool of money :)
@Jerma985 This is a great idea, I hope you enjoy it.
@Jerma985 this is the exact moment the car explodes
you should do a level of writing on a wall
@Jerma985 You're gonna have to move to the next area if you're gonna get hit
that's not a casket, it's a fuckin book
@Jerma985 It's just a hint to show how much you hate your game
You can't just use the 'buy' command. It's not even on the game screen
You have to go to the next room to see where you've been
Jerma why are you always late, I just want to watch you play this
@Jerma985 this is why we are on the internet
@Jerma985 It's like you're trying to make a childrens book
I'm so glad you didn't put on a full costume
@Jerma985 You should make a video on your youtube channel about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9mU_h0XQs
@Jerma985 did you ever think about how the music was on the mic?
This is the one where you can see the eyes
its the skeleton, he's a rat, he's just a big rat
You can just go to the blackhole and go through the hole
@Jerma985 Put on some fire extinguishers to keep you alive
@Jerma985 If you kill the dog I will go to sleep
@Jerma985 Just got here, what is this? I've never seen this before
i cant believe this game has a black hole
@Jerma985 Jerma, when will you get a new camera?
@Jerma985 If you put on the voice you'll be a better person
@Jerma985 Just like when you talk about the fact that you're not a clown
Jerma you're going to lose a ton of viewers if you don't have a lot of money
Why is the kid so scared of the person
@Jerma985 What do you mean, "what do you do"
@Jerma985 do a live stream of yourself getting hit in the head by a car
@Jerma985 did you know that you can run at speeds of up to 100mph?
@Jerma985 You can't just say you want to play this
@Jerma985 what did you say about the "jermaWalk" thing?
did you see the new oculus movie
====================
is this the streamer who beat the first level on stream???
@Jerma985 That's the same guy who beat the first level on stream
This is just a full moon, Jerma. You're the one who needs to be a planet.
@Jerma985 the anime had a lot of sexual tension
If you want a nice calm chat, don't take it too seriously
chat has been trying to force jerma to play as ronald
@Jerma985 you can get the trash in this level
I just joined the stream. Is this game still in development?
"Ya gotta go to the hospital" "I'm not here for this"
I think you have to turn off the camera
Chat can't stop the stream and I can't stop asking questions
HEY @Jerma985 I just got here, are you having fun?
why did he have to turn into a spider?
I want to see the slime all over the screen
Jerma this game is great! I can't wait to see you play it again!
it was a funny joke, but I'm sure you could tell that it was a bad one
This is why the new jerma channel is so great
I have a feeling that the next game is gonna be a bit more boring than this one
I don't want to be associated with this streamer
@Jerma985 you could have just left it there
this is a hard game to play at this point
@Jerma985 your finger is a hexagon, its not a circle
i feel like this is a fetish game
@Jerma985 you can put a good bit in the upper right corner
@Jerma985 You can get better items in this game
why is it called the streamer chat but jermaPluto
you can take a break to make it better
@Jerma985 You have to make the money back before you can move on
@Jerma985 it was a joke, you just needed to say it
@Jerma985 make a new one and make the new one a main channel
@Jerma985 It's so hard to get people to watch the stream, so it's gonna be a good stream
@Jerma985 So you got that guy who eats ass?
Jerma's gonna have to go back to the hospital
what a fucking nightmare to be in
Can we get a speedrun of this game?
is this the streamer that beat the first level on stream???
this is the first time i've ever seen a jerma stream
i wish we could get a jerma vods jerma vid
This is the end of the game, we're just gonna leave
Jerma, you gotta start the stream now, I don't wanna watch the stream
@Jerma985 it's a good game, but not very good
@Jerma985 when are you gonna play the other two?
@Jerma985 You're the only person I've ever seen that cares about the game. It's really great.
jerma you have a fuckin controller, you cant beat it
I think you need to do the last mission for the final boss
jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2
====================

do you not remember when you were a baby
@Jerma985 you should stop playing this and play the game again, i love you
@Jerma985 Why do you think you are so bad at this game?
The one that comes out of the vacuum
the only person who can stop you is the owner of the show
@Jerma985 You know he's gonna be playing this when it gets released
@Jerma985 Do you have to be in the water to drink it?

@Jerma985 how many times has jerma been gone for the past hour?
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
that was a real joke but now I'm happy
You have to go back to the ladder
it was so you could put a tshirt on
I think that's the game's way of saying "I'm not going to get it"
You've already made it to the top of the game
its a bad joke, not the worst joke
@Jerma985 I just got here what the hell is going on
It's a super secret, you need to speak to her
@Jerma985 you can use the red light to get a green light
@Jerma985 you are a moron to think of that
@Jerma985 What's the name of the game?
you know i would hate this game as much as the first one
@Jerma985 You need to make a speed run of this level
you can get a couple in here, just dont be a fan

@Jerma985 DO A QUIZ JERMA, NO ONE WILL KNOW
@Jerma985 When is the next emote contest? @Jerma985
i can't believe jerma is a streamer that hates chat
@Jerma985 "I've got a gun!" "I can't hit a kid!"
@Jerma985 you have to go through the right door
Jerma, you can turn off the screen and it's just a bunch of tiny messages
@Jerma985 When are you gonna play the other half of this game?
if you have to break the skin, that's why
@Jerma985 he has to move to the bathroom
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game for the first time in the theater.
you need to kill the boss first @Jerma985
Jerma you should play an FPS game like Wind Waker 2, it's like you're playing a simulation of a real life situation
he looks like a shitface from the last dlc
@Jerma985 you need to turn on the mic
@Jerma985 The entire game is just a visual novel
@Jerma985 you can get a new one by using the middle mouse button
@Jerma985 you have to press enter at the end

@Jerma985 It's an easy one to do and it's still in the original
jermaWalk i'll just have to do it to you
It's the one where you die and you become a zombie
@Jerma985 Just like how Jerma985 has been on a rant about how he can't stop talking about how "jerma" he is, he is not real. He is a figment of your imagination
that's like saying the earth is flat, but you're still on the moon
@Jerma985 I thought you were playing the new GBA game
@Jerma985 You can't make a school bus without a school bus
@Jerma985 I just got here and I'm having a lot of fun
@Jerma985 are you gonna do a skribbl series?
jerma is gonna be so mad at you when you say the word "jerma"
@Jerma985 "I'm a kid" was supposed to be a comedy reference
this guy is going to start a riot
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
Jerma should play a different game for every stream
he can't hear us he's deaf LUL
@Jerma985 how does it feel to be a giant dick?

@Jerma985 Did you just tell us about the carnival stream?

I'm a lawyer and I know how to do that
@Jerma985 You're just gonna throw all your money at the desk
you should do a dance stream with no lag
you need to learn how to take care of yourself
@Jerma985 Have you seen the new Samurai Jack game?
I can't believe this is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
Jerma is going to get a heart attack from this game
@Jerma985 You are now a sub for the rest of your life :)
This is just a video game of you playing games in the bathtub
that's how you feel when you're not paying attention
YOU ARE A RAT IN A CAR
jermaWalk I'm a lazy rat and I can't even do my work jermaWalk
@Jerma985 The game is a bit buggy, I cant see you
imagine getting up at 7am for an hour and you still don't have a baby
jerma is a psycho, he can't be bothered to read chat
How long has he been playing this game?
@Jerma985 YOU CAN TALK TO THE SOUNDTRACK ON THE BATHROOM
Is this the streamer that lost to Pinwheel?
@Jerma985 your dog is just a little bitch
I've been watching this for 3 hours and I'm finally starting to get it
@Jerma985 You can only use it on the first boss
@Jerma985 The only way to save is to buy more of the chocolate.
I'm gonna miss the stream, but I'm not gonna miss the stream jermaPluto

@Jerma985 Can you tell the story of your childhood?
@Jerma985 can you turn the mic up in the mic?
i cant believe i just got a gift sub
@Jerma985 did you ever think about doing a full stream?
I'm pretty sure it's just a game of thrones
@Jerma985 you can go to the other side
i cant believe this is the streamer who beat
====================
i thought this was a new character
@Jerma985 Why did you never tell us about this
I'm gonna take a nap. You're still in the video?
I like how the entire game is in one area
i think he said "he's a good boy"
@Jerma985 it's a normal sound effect, not a noise
@Jerma985 I've been watching for like 10 hours and it just makes you feel like a chad
how long did you have to be on this one joke
Jerma's gonna get stabbed by the giant spider in the corner
This is what I want to hear from you
@Jerma985 You can't just play this game when you're playing the game you're playing LUL
Says the guy who makes all of the rules
@Jerma985 What's the problem with it being like a dark souls game?
jermaChomp 📣 HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE IT? IT'S GOT CANDY
i'm not going to lie, i was hoping for a purple shirt
i cant believe jerma is doing a fart joke
Jerma, you know you can't actually beat this game without the wii remote, right?
jermaOld I'm gonna die in the stream jermaOld
i think he has a weird itch i think
You can have a voice changer that lets you turn on a webcam
JERMA, are you playing this on the Wii?
Boomer game, the internet is bad. It's not a game.
What if you were to get stabbed in the back?
@Jerma985 I like how you are still playing this
LUL this is like when a kid gets stuck in a tree
@Jerma985 can you please not do the joke where you pretend to be a child?
@Jerma985 you need to press the button and a button with the gamecube controller
@Jerma985 You have to go up a level to the right
@Jerma985 please stop spamming the link, i have to get my copy of this game
@Jerma985 you can hear the need for a hat in the background
I wish there was a better way to watch this stream.
i don't even know what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 please tell me how to play the game
can you just play it like the "combo" game?
Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 You can't just buy and sell it

jermaWalk THIS IS NOT A JOB jermaWalk
@Jerma985 i hope you're doing well and not just streaming today
The sound effects in this game are so damn good
i think they're too loud for this game
@Jerma985 It's not like you're a bad person. You just need to work on your voice
@Jerma985 The game is playing a different version than you
@Jerma985 I think you're losing your mind when you turn off the game
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you play this game
@Jerma985 You can't just play this game for 8 hours and it's fucking awful
@Jerma985 This is just a shitty game, they're going to ruin it
what if we kissed and we all just sat here
If you don't like the game, just play it
Jerma is gonna be playing this game for the next hour
@Jerma985 You can't just use the controller with the gamecube
@Jerma985 What do you think of the dev?
i think you're gonna need to get a new camera
I hope you can get a bike that has a blue noise
why is this boomer streamer so popular LUL
i think you have to be a medic to get the healing item
this game is the most boring thing i have ever seen
@Jerma985 do you think it's possible to have a a car and a drone at the same time?
i would like to see your facecam :)
how do you do a hard game like this
@Jerma985 What about the T-pose for the second time?
I'm going to sleep now, Jerma. wake me up when you're done
this is like the most fun game ever
@Jerma985 The game is making you feel like you're having a hard time with the game.
why is there a bomb in the corner
@Jerma985 You can't leave the stream without getting sued

====================
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
i dont want to be in a world where everyone is a chad
Hes still a guy? He's just being a dick
I can't believe Jerma is gonna be late :(
if you don't finish the game in 15 minutes you're not a real gamer
YOU NEED TO SEND IT TO THE TOWN
@Jerma985 You can't just eat the same one as the last one.
@Jerma985 you need to be able to speed up
the whole game is just like this and they're all the same
@Jerma985 That's what you call a golden spoon.
i just got back from work and this is what i come back to
@Jerma985 It's a bit, but its not a bad joke
i bet you can't beat a game in 30 seconds
imagine if you were playing this game with an exclamation point

you're going to be in for a while
jermaWalk i'm gonna be honest, I'm just here for the video
this is why we have so many jerma memes
@Jerma985 You need to make sure to make sure you're not being controlled
That's not what it looks like, Jeremy. That's the face of the enemy
You know this game is actually fun
@Jerma985 You should play the new monster rancher @Jerma985

i think you can get a little bit of that as well
you can do it, just don't play it
@Jerma985 theres a chance to turn it off and just be a clown

this game is a nightmare, you can't make fun of it
@Jerma985 I think this is a good place to start, it's just a weird tutorial

this is a very easy level for you
@Jerma985 You can use the rock to flip it
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?

@Jerma985 you can turn off the game audio so it plays better
@Jerma985 What do you think about the xbox?
@Jerma985 you have to have a college degree to get in

jermaPluto It's not like I've ever seen it before
i just got here why is there a penis
you could have put the whole thing in the bin
if you say that, you're going to get a free mod badge
@Jerma985 the one you just left is in the last room
@Jerma985 I'm telling you the same thing, it's not a joke
if it was a hamburger it would be a ketchup sandwich
I have a feeling it would be a lot better if you didn't eat it first
why does this music sound like a fart sound
@Jerma985 can you put a picture of a chicken in the title?
@Jerma985 you just played the game, what did you think?
Jerma, there's a secret ending to the game, but I think it's not really worth it
I can't wait to see jerma play this game
@Jerma985 i think you need to press the button
@Jerma985 you can see the things that spawn on the ground
@Jerma985 I have to get a new laptop
It's almost as if they're making a video
@Jerma985 you are the only person to ever die to pinwheel
@Jerma985 do you have any idea what you're talking about?
@Jerma985 it's not the first time you've been here.
He's got the same voice as the dog
@Jerma985 i think you can hit the fall button to get out of the way
i can't believe jerma is gonna play this game
You know what, I'll let you fuck my dad
@Jerma985 do you think you'll ever play the new game?
I'm gonna go and get some food and then get mad at this
You're gonna go out of your way to kill that girl
jerma is gonna be a mod in a few days
Why does this music sound like it came from a horror film
This game is just a fever dream of a game
@Jerma985 dont put on the toilet shoes, they will clog it
I want to see Jerma play the game and not the movie
You can't get a car on the island @Jerma985
Jerma is a lot of fun to be a part of :)
you can't keep up with the chat if you don't know how to tell the difference
You can get a gun if you get the shovel
@Jerma985 You can get a shotgun if you just pick up the shovel
the big one is the middle one
jerma, why are you still playing this game
why is the guy in the back row pointing a gun at you
Why are you still streaming? This is really distracting
@Jerma985 The best part is the return of the jup
@Jerma985 are you gonna play more of this game?
why is there a foreskin in your face
@Jerma985 You can have a nice hat for the same price
you could have just bought a new computer
@Jerma985 you can't keep your promises jerma you're a liar
@Jerma985 are you gonna play a game for the new year?
@Jerma985 I heard you could use a scale of 2 to make the entire game look like it was made in one day
@Jerma985 can you get a camera on the right side of the room?
Jerma can't afford a new laptop for this, so he's got a new one
@Jerma985 do you not have a shovel
Jerma how come the sun is not on this year?
There are so many things you can do in this game
this is just the nature of twitch, we're all here
@Jerma985 if you have to think about it

if you can afford a house you can afford a car
@Jerma985 did you ever tell them you were playing a new game?

what are you going to do for the rest of the stream
I'm gonna see the vod boys at the end of the stream, guys

I wish there was a way to get free shit

@Jerma985 YOU CAN DO THE MISSIONS BY BUYING THEM IN THE MOVE

@Jerma985 Are you going to make a new game?
@Jerma985 The worst part is that you have to do all of them in one stream to win
Chat has Bashed 685 Seagulls, use !bash to help DarkMode
@Jerma985 when is the next Jerma Rumble? :)
@Jerma985 Are you going to play the game again?
just go to a different place and get the password
that's how you're supposed to use it tho
@Jerma985 PLEASE DON'T DO THAT, IT IS CURSED
i just got here what the fuck is this
did jerma know that the chat is on autopilot?
i'm glad to see you're still playing this game :)
@Jerma985 I think you can use the rock as a spring
how do you not know what a game is?
i have a bad feeling about this game
if you were a furry you'd be a vampire
it's been 10 years, we are done with this one
@Jerma985 do you think there's a reason you're still playing this?
he's not gonna play the game because he's a gamer PepeHands
JERMA YOU CAN DO IT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT
how do you get rid of all of those things
I'm not even playing it anymore. I'm gonna see the streamer.
@Jerma985 you're a fucking idiot, don't do this.
Dude this is the most cringe-y game I've ever seen
JERMA STOP PLAYING MY GAME YOU'RE FUCKED
how do you get a jup in the chat
Jerma, did you watch the VOD or did you just do this?
@Jerma985 you can put the pot in the pot and use it
@Jerma985 did you ever get a hoe?
@Jerma985 I'm a fan of the new series, can you explain why you're liking it?
@Jerma985 Is it a muppet movie or a fake
I've never heard of a burger before, thank you
hey jerma can you turn off the stream and turn off the music? i need to go to work
this is like that one song from the hit song "from the jungle"
that was one of the best streams i've ever seen
I have a rule of not using a fucking letter grade.
I can't believe Jerma985 was actually a mod
it's like the whole world is like this
I think it's an oil slick, not a pool
Oh man, I'm gonna miss the stream. Thanks for streaming!
you can make it so it's a real thing
@Jerma985 You can get a good glass of water at the bar
you're supposed to press the button that pops out of the way
we have to do this without the stream jerma
you can't be a monkey, you'll be a spider
i'm not gonna go to school until you go to the doctor
i know he said he was going to do a vr stream
@Jerma985 go to the other side of the room
@Jerma985 you should play a game that makes you feel better
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 17. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 The first and last one were the only good ones
@Jerma985 if you're not making money, you're a genius
@Jerma985 You'll need to restart the game to get a new character
@Jerma985 If you're the only one here, you're the only one here
You need to do the next level to get the next one
@Jerma985 I just got here, can you do a mod voice?
@Jerma985 you can see the brownie in the middle of the screen
@Jerma985 You have to make a certain amount of money to get a better one
jermaVenus Jerma is a lot of money and I am a lot of money
the game is rigged from the start
you have to be a mod to be a mod
he doesn't even have a green screen LUL
i think he's going to play the game first
@Jerma985 Can you
====================
@Jerma985 You look like you have a dragon's lair.
why are there so many people in chat LUL
this is like watching a video on your phone
jermaChomp I'M A F U C K E R
you have to give him the wallet before he goes
they're just playing for the most part because they don't want to talk about it
It's like a stream from a dead person
@Jerma985 have you tried the Nook Thing? It's a pretty cool game
I'm gonna go get my stuff and the computer's already out
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is the best jup i've ever seen
I can't wait for the stream to start and we're both dead
the "alligators are the least intelligent animals" meme
You know what the real Jerma is? A clown
I just came back and he's still playing this
I like the new Jerma Rumble 2, I love it
@Jerma985 why do you have to have the money to buy a pikachu plush?
@Jerma985 i just saw the glueman shirt, what a man of culture
this is what it's like to be a Jerma985 fan
@Jerma985 You're not gonna be able to win the lottery
I can't believe you've been doing this for the last 6 hours
I think the human eye is supposed to be a tiny eyeball
@Jerma985 The thing you're trying to do is have your eyes squish together
jermaOld the end is on the way jermaOld
it's ok jerma you can stop now
chat, let's get him to play it again
@Jerma985 If youre not in the chat it wont help
Jerma you're gonna be in trouble if you dont play this
I want to see jerma as a god of a gamer
jermaTV is the only thing I can watch now
@Jerma985 you have to buy a new ipad
@Jerma985 your posture is going to be weird
i cant believe this is how the carnival goes
we are the best, we dont need to see it
@Jerma985 This is the only game I want to play on stream
@Jerma985 when are you going to do an AYAYA stream?
YOURE BEING HELD AS A RAT TODAY, YOU'RE LYING
@Jerma985 you can just put it in the back of the car
@Jerma985 There's a game called 'Bars in the Town' that's more like "Bars in the Town"
@Jerma985 I think the Dreamcast version of this game has a higher framerate. It's probably the same as the original.
@Jerma985 I'm gonna be honest, I didn't think you could actually get that far. I don't think you can
@Jerma985 you can't just read chat and pretend to be angry
How many times do you have to kill him?
@Jerma985 you have to get a head start on it
@Jerma985 if you're going to play this I think you should do it with a chat that isn't trolling
jerma has a few more games to come
i have a 50% chance of getting jerma to play the game I want
Jerma I'm really angry and I don't know how to stop it
jerma you cant eat a cake with that
@Jerma985 Why does it look like a motherfucker?
@Jerma985 You need to eat a shoe to get the black mask

YOU CAN EAT A SHOE ON STREAM JERMA
jermaWalk THIS GAME IS FUCKED, I WANT TO GET OFF MR. STER
@Jerma985 You need to let the dog out
You need to get your facecam on first
jermaPluto when you can't take a shit, you gotta take a shit
@Jerma985 You can see how many people have died in the last hour
@Jerma985 I think this is just a small town with a little trash.
jerma is a wild card in the game
Can we get a "jerma is a loser" emote
@Jerma985 you need to draw the character with the heart
@Jerma985 What do you think of the flute music?
@Jerma985 you should be able to turn off the webcam. it's too scary
jermaTV is the best thing that has happened to the internet
@Jerma985 can you do the voice in a bit
jerma you can tell when someone is trying to get in
Jerma has to take his pants off
if you die in the game you die in real life
It's like if you put
====================
the entire thing was made by people who think they're smarter than they are
the only reason he's still streaming is because he has a good game, he has a bad game, and he's streaming it
@Jerma985 I hope you get a sub, you're amazing.
why would you have to make a frog?
jerma has a new emote called "jerma" i think
what if you like music for all of us
the way the game is looking at it
@Jerma985 You can't hear the sound of it
@Jerma985 The game was designed to confuse you
you need to do this to the invisible spider
If it's not a joke, you're a liar
@Jerma985 What's the name of this game? Is it called Noita or Noita 2?
@Jerma985 you need to use the ball to break the light
Jerma is the one who gets hit in the head
@Jerma985 No, you can do this in the tutorial
You can't play a game without a controller
i have a mom who works at a gas station
he can't see the gun, he can't shoot it
@Jerma985 You're supposed to be streaming for the hour or two.
@Jerma985 remember to do your taxes in the bathroom, you'll be fined if you do.
@Jerma985 You can't say what you are not going to
can we have a jerma shirt emote?
hey guys what the fuck is this furry shit

jerma you cant make a game with a controller
@Jerma985 why does it have a facecam on
jerma how do you know what a fish is
@Jerma985 You need to play it for the rest of the stream
if you have to beat the game, what's your opinion on the carnival stream?
we need to see your face when you are late

I think it's been over 15 years since the last one
I have to go to work tomorrow, can I get a job in the next hour?

@Jerma985 Get a bottle of water and drink it.
I got a sub from a guy who beat this game in like 20 minutes
jerma is a big boy he will do anything to you
You have to put it in the same spot as the pillar
It's the same as the original one. You just have to play it a different way
Why is the streamer still here? I just got here
@Jerma985 the game is going to break if you keep doing the wrong thing
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
I remember when this was a kids game
why does this game have a dead body in it
jermaPluto i am a jerma fan and i still hate this game
Jerma you're not getting the best score, you're gonna get a fake one
@Jerma985 you can't just say that you hate the game
@Jerma985 I'm trying to go to sleep, can you do the little voice again?
I can't believe I'm watching Jerma play a game that I know he hates
Jerma, I was just watching your stream, how are you still here?
@Jerma985 There's a hidden map in the right corner of the screen
Jerma, you have to beat the game, you have to do it
jermaOld man that's a long time to be alive
@Jerma985 i have no idea what you're talking about
@Jerma985 just got here and this is the first time I've ever seen this guy talk about himself
@Jerma985 you can press A to see what he is doing
he was talking about his new car and not his old one
hey guys, what happened to Jerma? I'm wondering what happened
@Jerma985 you should put the "pug" sound in the background
@Jerma985 It was the same for the Wii
@Jerma985 So this is the guy who beat that level on stream?
the one where you start a game
Jerma you should put on a good game
Jerma you're in the wrong video you
====================
Jerma is the only person I watch jermaPluto
I got a new laptop today. It's great. I'm gonna be back in an hour or two, and I'll be a part of the stream.
Jerma is gonna get angry if he plays another game
i cant believe jerma is a childrens book narrator
@Jerma985 you're going to be going through the pain
I remember when I was a kid jermaOld
that guy is a complete mess of a person
@Jerma985 you have to put the headset on for a while and it'll go into the gamer reflex
how long has jerma been playing this for?
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this? I just wanna see you play something else :)
@Jerma985 I think you might have to do it again
How long has he been playing this? i dont know
I need to do some work and just have to keep my voice down
Is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
I'm so glad you're playing this, i can't stop laughing
I don't know what to say to you
It's not really a joke. I just wanted to be entertained :)
my mom said it's my turn on the xbox
@Jerma985 can we get some sweet free ipod nano's
@Jerma985 i was looking for a new laptop and i got the wrong one
Why does he keep playing this game?
@Jerma985 YOU DIDN'T GET A SUB UNTIL YOU PUT IT ON THE MENU
@Jerma985 is this the guy that beat dark souls on stream?
@Jerma985 You can do it if you're not a robot
I'm not going to lie, I've been watching for like 8 hours now and I can't believe this is still happening
@Jerma985 If you can't do that, then you can't do it
@Jerma985 the boss is a big one, it's not that hard
@Jerma985 i thought you were gonna finish this game
Just got here, why is he playing this game again?
@Jerma985 can you turn off the stream so i can watch it later
i feel like it's only been like 2 hours
@Jerma985 I can't wait to see the carnival stream
i can't believe jerma is getting so addicted to this game
@Jerma985 you can only do that if you're not a god
HES GONNA BE TAKING CARE OF HIM
He's gonna be at the top of the RULEZER
@Jerma985 This is the most aggressive way to do the jup
@Jerma985 remember to put the control in your hand
@Jerma985 you can use the spear to get the shield
I was gone for 5 hours what happened
@Jerma985 you can do this in the tutorial
@Jerma985 your streamer is being stupid in this game
@Jerma985 How much do you pay for your own food?
@Jerma985 I have the exact same issue with a tv and it's really good
the only way to get that is to turn off the stream
I can't believe this guy beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the game being bad?
he is not a fucking robot, he is a human
@Jerma985 i know this is an emote, but what happened to the previous one?
@Jerma985 you have to beat the last level
Jerma, you're gonna get a lot of shit from people who would hate you for playing this
you're gonna get kicked out of the store
this game is just a scam to make you pay more money
@Jerma985 jerma, you need to learn how to aim for the chest
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game?
@Jerma985 can we get a gif of the stream?
Chat we love you guys. You're just the best

I just got here, why is he playing this game?
I will take this to the gallows if he doesnt stream on time
@Jerma985 Play "Wiffleback" in the background, it's actually a jup storm
You don't need to be a dick, it's your friend
@Jerma985 Put a picture of the stuffed mouse in the bottom left
if you're lucky, you'll get a nice ring
@Jerma985 use the game to get your gamer license
you're just
====================
@Jerma985 you're not the only one who needs to be able to read them
you need to get a knife in this game
I think this is the one where you'll get the bad ending
I love the 1v1 of this game and the fact that you can just shoot people at it
This is how you look at a person
@Jerma985 I know you're not gonna say that but I just think that you're kinda weird
can someone tell me what the fuck is happening
They are the same color as the whole thing
I would love to see Jerma try to make a video of someone who isnt even a gamer
@Jerma985 that's why they're called Bogs, they're the bad guys
@Jerma985 You have to use the other side of the ring to get the jump.
@Jerma985 use the 1st item to get the secret item
@Jerma985 did you know that there are more than 50 different types of spiders in the game?
@Jerma985 You'll never be able to escape the trap
@Jerma985 I know you can't play this game without a controller, but I just want to know
@Jerma985 What is the name of the car you are using?
It's like when your parents go to the dentist for the first time
I was just thinking about the voice acting
why did you keep doing this to me
What if you have a computer with a full memory card?
there's a picture of a clown on your desk
@Jerma985 Please be nice to me. I'm starving
I can't wait to see Jerma's reaction to the green screen stream.
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game.
if you eat the shoe you have to eat it again
@Jerma985 the only way to get rid of the X is to buy a new one
Jerma is the best streamer on twitch :)
@Jerma985 The first level is the hardest
jermaChomp 📣 Gotta get the boots. You can't go back in.
@Jerma985 What do you think about the Chibi Robo movie?
I'm going to get a MEGA MILK PIZZA
you can still take the pills but not the booze
Jerma is going to give up on this game.
@Jerma985 There's a lot of ways to get it off. You can just do it at a certain point in the game, like in the tutorial.
jermaPluto I can't believe you died to Pinwheel
@Jerma985 you don't have to jump if you're not going to the right
@Jerma985 are you going to play the game again?
I think you can just get out of the water
that was my first time watching this stream
There's a way to get out of the lava, just go right
@Jerma985 you can get a sword in this game
@Jerma985 The game has a little more of a jumping mechanic than the first game
it's not the first time they've been this close LUL
@Jerma985 Try to get the boat and jump to the next area
this is the type of game where you can see it's not real
I can't believe jerma is a brainless prestreamer
JERMA YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BLOOD

@Jerma985 It's not like you're playing it backwards
@Jerma985 I don't think you can use the elevator
@Jerma985 play the level from the first one
@Jerma985 Have you ever played a game on Xbox Live?
@Jerma985 Why is it that you have a better idea of the amount of blood and sweat you can see
@Jerma985 What's the deal with the cow?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -15. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.

@Jerma985 Can you turn off the music please
@Jerma985 This is the first time you've played this
the music is the only thing that makes it different

@Jerma985 theres a secret level in the bottom left
@Jerma985 I think you're about to get hurt from a knock-off
What do you think about the amount of times you've been told to "OwO"
@Jerma985 you look like a bostonian with a jermaBld
If you want a quick rundown of what's happening right now, you should check out the videos of the stream, it's quite a bit of content.
jermaSun YOU'RE GOING TO DIE IN THE GAME
@Jerma985 you need to play more games in order to get better Kappa

what if you've been playing this game for 2 years
I’m just a boomer, I don't understand the game
@Jerma985 I can't believe you think this is an old video.
@Jerma985 Did you just make a joke about a game where you can't even beat the game?
@Jerma985 use the axe on the cart LUL
@Jerma985 what is your opinion on the new youtube meme
The original one was a fucking fucking mess
This is the streamer that would go to jail for cheating on stream
This is what I hear when I see Jerma's stream. He has a lot of money.
I thought the stream was over before the stream started
@Jerma985 make your own home with the gamecube controller
he doesn't want to die because he's a degenerate
so this is how you get the health bars?
@Jerma985 did you know that Jerma is a 4chan member?
imagine not using the guide in a stream
can you buy a place with people in it?
@Jerma985 I'm so sorry you're still playing this game. It's been fun to see you play it
I had no idea what was going on LUL
You're going to end up with a 3d animatronics cube

@Jerma985 I have a bunch of subs but I'm only giving one to the mods
@Jerma985 I'm actually not sure you've played this game in the past, it's a lot of different parts of the game
If you keep going it gets better :)

@Jerma985 if you get to the sun, do you have to go back to the sun?

I wish he would just get his name out LUL
@Jerma985 just take a break for the stream

i'm going to go to sleep so I can sleep :)
@Jerma985 If you die in the game, you die in real life
the guy who beat the game for 5 hours

"The Senses of a Fetus"
I can't believe Jerma is a professional gamer
I don't want to see this happen to me
i was watching this stream and it was so funny
no, you need to have a special thing on your brain
@Jerma985 You need to press the key to reset the game
how is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 You can get the Taffly from the last boss. It's really good.
You can't buy an E-clown in the middle of a Walmart
"What do you want to do?" "I'm gonna play the game"
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're fucking stupid. I can't fucking believe this is happening.
if you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 hey @Jerma985, can you please do a "PLAY THIS GAME" stream? I'd really appreciate it.
@Jerma985 what if I'm the only one who loves this game?
Jerma what are you doing with your life?
@Jerma985 i think you have a heart attack
@Jerma985 it's because you can't put it in a jar
@Jerma985 You gotta get to the other side of the road
I just got here. What the hell is this?
oh god he has a ladder he can't get up

@Jerma985 you can turn off the light in the car
@Jerma985 when will you play a game with this game?
Jerma, your hair is falling out and you're laughing.
@Jerma985 "If you're not a good dad, you're not a good dad"

did you know that the last time he streamed I was fucking dead jermaPluto
I never realized the police were there to kill you
@Jerma985 Why are you playing a videogame?
I can't believe Jerma is a professional gamer
@Jerma985 You're a genuine hero. You're just a little bit selfish
@Jerma985 What are you gonna do for the rest of the stream?
Hey Jerma, I'm gonna need your help with my job. Can I come to your house?
you can jump off of the horse LUL
you should play the original game in the first place
jerma just joined the stream and he's still at the beginning
@Jerma985 You should do an all new vegas stream
@Jerma985 it's not that you're bad at it, it's just that you're a bad gamer
@Jerma985 this is a bad idea, it's gonna make it so bad
You have to put your facecam up against the camera
@Jerma985 Go to the town to get a good reward
this is like the old days of jermacraft
@Jerma985 You have to use the whistle to stop the jump
@Jerma985 you're not gonna have a good time
@Jerma985 do you know what a light is?
@Jerma985 Do you think the normal house in this game is a house?
there is no water in the desert, it's just a normal house
imagine not knowing how to throw rocks @Jerma985
you can tell when he's in a bad mood by how much he says
@Jerma985 you should be in the next jerma rumble
i thought you were playing a mobile game
"I don't like this part, I'll go back to the game"
This is literally just the game you played, you know it's bad
@Jerma985 This is why you should be a professional gamer
you have to beat the game before you can leave
jerma can you do a jup? I'm gonna be a little late
jerma you sound like a punk band member
@Jerma985 you should play the rest of the game
@Jerma985 There's a good one in the discord
i wonder what the bar is supposed to be
@Jerma985 it's not a wall, it's a door
I'm not gonna do this, but I'll be able to
@Jerma985 if you don't do the cutscene it will be a full episode of Viva Pinata
@Jerma985 I hope you get the controller, you're a gamer
@Jerma985 you need to get the last item

One of the games I play is called Mario Kart and it's a fun ride
@Jerma985 Put a bird house next to the stream
@Jerma985 that's like 100% why you're so bad at this
@Jerma985 that's a good idea, you'd be great at it :)

oh my god that was the best thing
You can get a knock down from the blue one
my dad just gifted me a sub :)
@Jerma985 Why did you put that on the list?
just wait till he's out of his mind
did you know that the average adult has a penis
@Jerma985 what if he turned into a spider and ate it
@Jerma985 I like the story and its just a bit of a gag.
how can a game be fun if you're not even doing anything
I think you need to go to the dentist
I just woke up did he miss the stream?
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU'RE IN A ROW, DO NOT GO TO THE ROW
imagine if we had an alien in this game
I don't think you can see the other ones
@Jerma985 it's like a spider with a bad story
@Jerma985 You need to get the puke out of it
@Jerma985 I have no idea what you are talking about
@Jerma985 You can't be in the same spot as us
@Jerma985 the best part of the game is the secret boss
@Jerma985 just use the dynamite to make the catapult
@Jerma985 you can't just throw it away, you have to use it
@Jerma985 You can't just run away from it
Why is Jerma playing this game on his pc?
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get to the first one, you'll get the last one.
JERMA WE WERE BORN ON THE 21ST OF JANUARY, WE WERE BORN ON THE 21ST OF JANUARY
@Jerma985 just turn it off while the audio is on
I think it's supposed to be a tutorial
@Jerma985 do you think you'll be able to beat the level?

@Jerma985 do you think there are any people in chat who don't know how to use twitch?
@Jerma985 do you think your computer is going to explode?
This is the last stream of the decade

Hes doing this because he cant get a sub
"I'm going to get a replacement for my old house"
@Jerma985 is this the guy who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 It's like the biggest one in the game
@Jerma985 I think you're gonna get to the next one
@Jerma985 this is the last time we can have an emote
@Jerma985 You should play the game as an AI
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO DO IT THE WHOLE TIME
It's like the first time you've ever played a game in this stream
@Jerma985 if you were to do that it would be with your family, not you
@Jerma985 It's been 15 years since you last streamed
why is it a pinky finger? what a weirdo
I'm glad he's playing this game and not just "Screw you!"
@Jerma985 You can also get a random item from the main menu
How do you even get a server that doesn't have a proper name?
this is the only game i know of that's made by a guy
this is the only game i've ever played
@Jerma985 this is the best part of the game
@Jerma985 you have to put the t shirt on
this is what you get for not being a mother
@Jerma985 You can't be angry at a game you're playing
@Jerma985 do you know what a pizza is
the people in the middle are a little bit more confused
jerma you have to buy the food if you want to be able to eat it
@Jerma985 do you know what a pizza is
@Jerma985 you can't hide it in the bathroom, it's not in the bathroom.
@Jerma985 The gameplay is just to the point of being boring.
jerma has been in the hospital for over an hour
This is the end of the game @Jerma985
You should put some of the money in the safe
I think that's the way to go
@Jerma985 We are watching the movie with a PC
this is how you say "i'm gonna die"
@Jerma985 theres a secret boss in the secret area
@Jerma985 You need to place a huge fence around the house.
I don't think you can get the boots
I just want to see a gothic movie
@Jerma985 do you still have
====================
Think of the other ones as a musical instrument
oh shit I just got here, i missed the stream
If you go outside you get a big boss
I remember when he was the best
@Jerma985 Just got here, did he say what he's gonna do?
BEST JOKE THIS YEAR IS JERMA'S PRANK JOKE
we need to make sure jerma is the only one with a visible dick
@Jerma985 you have to put the family guy in the family

@Jerma985 You can try the good ones first @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You need to get the head of the monster
Jerma please I don't want to hear that
Did jerma get the disney rights for this game?
@Jerma985 You look like a really cute little girl

@Jerma985 i love how the tutorial is just like this
Chat has Bashed 28 Seagulls, use !bash to help
jermaOld I'm in the middle of the ocean
@Jerma985 This is the part where you unlock the boots
i feel like this is the only way to get out of this
You're supposed to be a Jerma fan now
@Jerma985 are you going to play the other ones?
@Jerma985 Can you try to make a new account?
Jerma is a master at being a jock
@Jerma985 you need to save the boss before he dies
I'm sure the ones that don't make a noise
I'm from the future, I remember when this was a stream jermaOld
@Jerma985 you can use the red dot to make the circle larger
jermaWalk I'm the new Jerma, get out of my way
you can't really blame him for a bad stream
@Jerma985 I'm a professional cosplay artist, I have work to do
@Jerma985 try to find the map with the log, you might need to figure out where it is
@Jerma985 You're the one that needs to take care of the kids
he has a nice big red rat tail
@Jerma985 You're gonna have to fix it in a second
Chat has Bashed 270 Seagulls, use !bash to help

@Jerma985 did you do the first boss? LUL
jermaSour i want to see you do the first one
I wish I could do that jermaPluto

this game is actually really good, i like it
@Jerma985 You can use the red dot to make the circle bigger
i just got here, what the hell is this
I think they got him for the big money
i just got here, what the fuck is this
@Jerma985 If you don't go to bed right now you're a piece of shit
I think it's in a way, but I don't know for sure
@Jerma985 How do you have your dick in your mouth?
I don't think you can do it anymore
@Jerma985 This is the plot of the hit and run movie
@Jerma985 You need to get the bell in your mouth
@Jerma985 you have to have a key to the ship
How much money do you have to pay Jerma?
he is the bad guy on the street
@Jerma985 you are not supposed to use the poop pee pee
@Jerma985 can you turn down the music so i can hear the music?
@Jerma985 use the bathroom to get out of the bathroom
@Jerma985 You need to use the grass for the next level
@Jerma985 it's a weird thing, you have a fucking bad gamer brain.
just got here, did he say what he's gonna do?
@Jerma985 Can you change your gamecube controller?
@Jerma985 i think you need to put the door in the back
I think they're just getting the truck for now
@Jerma985 you need to play the other game
@Jerma985 YOU ARE NOT A STREAMER, YOU ARE A GUY
It's not a good way to get money, it's
====================
You can't kill them in a game like this
@Jerma985 you should do an animation where you pretend to be a girl
i know it's a video but how did they get so excited?
@Jerma985 you can buy them with the coin machine
I would have bought a good Xbox for this
I cant believe jerma lied about eating a shoe
@Jerma985 I cant believe you're a bald streamer
@Jerma985 I'm waiting for my friend to come see you. I just got home.
I have no idea what's going on, but it sounds like a 4chan message
JERMA YOU HAVE TO STOP PLAYING THIS GAME RIGHT NOW
I don't think Jerma is gonna play this again
@Jerma985 why would you play this game if you don't want to play this
@Jerma985 If you don't have the item on you can't save it
@Jerma985 Do you eat the inside of your mouth?
Jerma is gonna die and then you'll die again
@Jerma985 You gotta get the full health of the gta
its a bit hard to get a quick stream if you don't get the boots
it's just the power of the camera OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 YOU WONT BE DEAD IN THIS GAME
@Jerma985 do you think the people will be in the next game?
@Jerma985 You can get a new character to take the place of the original character
jerma is too big for the boat, he needs a bigger boat
what the hell is the point of the game if its just this
@Jerma985 can you do a "stream on time" joke?
@Jerma985 you should do the "pretend to be a girl" joke
I thought this was a joke for a second
I think you can use the ring to make the ring work
@Jerma985 Do you plan to play Dead Rising 2 on stream?
@Jerma985 Do you ever think that a ghost is your friend?
I thought you were going to be playing the sequel
@Jerma985 Hey, I just joined, what the hell happened?
i thought you were gonna do this one
he's gonna be going for a while, we'll be right back
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 518. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I just came back from the shower and Jerma is still playing this game?
i think its better to do a funny joke than to not do it
I think you need to buy a new wardrobe
@Jerma985 You should go back and get the boots
we need to have a community night jermaVenus
I think it's better to do it right now
@Jerma985 you can't leave the field and leave the castle, you've been here before
Jerma's a bad boy, he doesn't need to be a boy
@Jerma985 I'm going to buy the whole thing.
@Jerma985 Play the Muppets in the background of this
i'm just gonna say it. I'm not a witch
I can't believe Jerma is playing a childrens game jermaPluto
Jerma can you please sing in the background
@Jerma985 Please be careful, it's a lot of blood
I just got here and I just heard the game is ending and I'm worried about the spoilers
jermaWalk I'm out of work jermaWalk I'm out of work
@Jerma985 This is the only game you'll play
I have to get my new keyboard, I don't know what to do
i can't believe jerma is streaming today
The only one who doesn't get the joke is me
@Jerma985 Do a stream where you're going to eat pizza
if you have a console that is plugged in, you can switch between the two
I love how jerma's voice is so over the top that it's like the voice of an old man
just get a car, you can drive around in it
I love how Jerma is actually being an idiot
You can get a new character to take the place of the original
I feel like you're playing a mobile game
@Jerma985 That was a joke I never expected
@Jerma985 they'll just be making a new game every year
do you have a griller's license to cook?
why is this game so hard to find
I think they made a zombie game but only to make the zombies think they're living in the same house
@Jerma985 The resolution is like 10k and you can't do that
This is the best fucking game ever made
@Jerma985 you can go to the park and get the key
@Jerma985 you can hold shift and click to save
I can't
====================
@Jerma985 the meat on the bone is a whole lot better than the meat on bone pizza
I’m not sure if i would ever want to have that conversation
I can't believe you didn't say it right @Jerma985
why is he talking about the shoe? jermaPluto
it's because you have the head of a duck
@Jerma985 You're a fucking liar, you lied about that fucking bird
Cant wait for the winks to be deleted, Jerma
I'm a Jerma fan and I love the streams
@Jerma985 if you didn't know about this game, you'd have to eat a ghost pepper
I'm just a casual player so I can tell you that the game's not fun
@Jerma985 im very disappointed that you're not in the chat
what the hell is this, a jerma stream
what does it even mean to be a dev
I wonder how many of those are actually random
Jerma is a serial killer, I think he's going to be in the next Jerma Rumble
@Jerma985 you're going to get timed out for this

You've got to make the whole city a little more clean
jermaSour i wanna see you fuck this game
@Jerma985 It's a funny meme, but there's a reason that it's such a thing.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -32. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 The thing was just a bunch of monkeys
you can't get a good looking t shirt
jermaWalk i wanna see you fuck this game
the game is a little too dark for me
@Jerma985 you can only give them the second one
yeah but you have to get the ones you can't get
why did it look like the rain was coming
@Jerma985 do you not have a laptop that can run this game?
this is the first time i've seen a person who didn't like this game
he was trying to make the noise for his own fun
@Jerma985 if you don't put your shoes on it's not going to clean up
He's only been watching since he started playing it
@Jerma985 If you just leave the chainsaw in the trash can, it'll be a full meal.
@Jerma985 I'm the only person in chat who actually has a problem with this game and I don't think you have to worry about it
I wish you could just play this game for a while
"i can't believe you're still playing this game"
Why is this guy in the same place he was when he died
@Jerma985 I didn't get a refund, you should know that
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get it for free
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TRAFFIC
@Jerma985 your hair is like the giant spider in spiderman 1
I think the only real problem is that there's no way you'll be able to take it off
This is the second time in a week Jerma is gonna get banned
@Jerma985 do a full stream of that
I would love to see Jerma do a bit more sonic
@Jerma985 what if we kissed and we both made a full blown big band
@Jerma985 you're gonna get hit by a train
@Jerma985 You can't be the one doing the taxes
@Jerma985 It's a perk, you need to
====================
@Jerma985 Do you like the sound of the camera?
hey chat, you can do it :)
I think he's doing the original voice for this game.
I think it would be a cool idea to try and give him the same voice as himself
its gonna be really good for jerma, he knows what he's doing
you can see the full version on steam
Jerma I'm going to get timed out for you please
@Jerma985 I think it's just for the kind of things you do with the internet
@Jerma985 you can go to the bottom of the map
@Jerma985 you cant see the girl's name when you have the camera
jermaOld The one where you were going to say that
@Jerma985 do you have any idea what the game is doing?
@Jerma985 This is the worst stream of the year
how many times did he say that?
i have no idea what this game is but i love it
jerma please stop being mean to us i love you so much
jermaWalk i don't have time to take a shower jermaWalk
i'm just here because i'm a dev and i need to hear the music to tell you about the stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you have to do the final boss
@Jerma985 it's a zoomed in version, it's on the left
This game is so much better than the last game
jerma is literally playing a game and it's not funny
@Jerma985 is it me or are you a little weird?
I can't believe Jerma is actually streaming now jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you've been streaming for 2 hours, you are a liar
Jerma you need to stop being mean to us, we are worried
Jerma, I just got here, what the hell is going on?
@Jerma985 You can just hit the middle button and it's all at the same time
i thought this was the only game you could beat it
I can't believe jerma is actually streaming LUL
@Jerma985 I think you should use the magic crystal to get a heartstone
The dlc has to be first person or you won't be able to go back to the main menu
oh fuck hes just gonna do it again
why is the sound of the fucking car being driven by the dog in the background
@Jerma985 This is the first time you have played this game.
imagine if it was the real Jerma985 LUL
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
jermaOld Where did the jermabucks come from? jermaOld
I don't think this is a good idea
@Jerma985 You can see the blue arrow in the top left.
@Jerma985 I'm sorry to hear that, I'm in the bathroom.
Jerma you need to show the other team a picture of you
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM FROM DOING IT
it's like when you get a haircut but it's a bit long
you need to build a house to fund it
Jerma, it's only a $100 stream, what a psycho
if you're not a kid what are you doing?
@Jerma985 have you ever had a bad idea?
I’ll be back in a couple hours with a bunch of cool new things to do
jerma is going to be so pissed when he finds out he's the only one to have a disease
Did you see that monster in the back?
the only good part is the one where it's just a bunch of small ones
jermaWalk I'M IN A DREAM, I'M IN A DREAM jermaWalk
the fucking sound of a telephone in the background
Jerma why do you have the word "pizza" in your name?
i think you need to watch more movies
it's too quiet to hear the music jermaPluto
@Jerma985 He's got to be having a heart attack
Jerma, do you like being a slave? jermaPluto
This is what happens when you go into the dream
@Jerma985 this is the dark souls of ps2 games
I'm so happy that you're playing this game!
I think you need to watch the other team
Jerma you're gonna get a lot of internet problems
I know, I just need to find a way to stop the stream
@Jerma985 you have to get the boots first
@Jerma985 Did you ever play the game or am I just crazy

====================
the streamer that made the rat movie 3d movie maker
You have to kill the other guards first
@Jerma985 can you please stop talking about "dont do it"
I just got here and I cant get into it, but I know you're going to talk about it.
i think you shouldnt play it in the first place
this is a black screen game, you can't stop the stream
I can't wait for you to play these games with me
@Jerma985 why are you wearing the same shirt as me
Jerma can't hear the game and can't even see the game
jerma's going to die of old age in the first hour
@Jerma985 can you play the game with me? I'm pretty sure you'd like it
JERMA PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE SHOOT THE TREE
@Jerma985 if you don't get the boots then you'll have to pay for them
I'm too lazy to get a discount on the ebay stuff.
Just buy a bigger and better car, he's got no money to spend
@Jerma985 if you are a jerma fan you should check out this cool-ass Twitch streamer :)
@Jerma985 The real question is how long it takes for them to get to the next level.
@Jerma985 it's not a dream, it's a dream
i like how jerma is really mad at the game
@Jerma985 you have to turn the stream off
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't seen that one before
he's playing a game he knows nothing about
@Jerma985 Can you make your own sekiro puzzle?
He’s gonna be dead in the next hour LUL
i hate the game it sucks to watch
you can go to the next level and fight the boss
I love how you are just a small man

@Jerma985 You need to do the jump on the car
I hope you just take the stream to the hospital
Jerma you are the only streamer I really enjoy.
I'm gonna be honest I hate this game so much
I thought the only way to get a good burger is to eat a shoe
@Jerma985 You've been doing this for like 30 minutes
the jermaOneguy stream is the only thing I'm allowed to watch
jermaWalk my Dad is in the house jermaWalk
@Jerma985 You're gonna be in a coma for the next 5 years
The fucking japanese version of the game is the best
@Jerma985 you can make the quest a bit easier
@Jerma985 The answer is to put the otto chest in the chest
@Jerma985 The game is in the corner of the screen, and you can't see it
i dont think this is a game about money
yeah it's like a 10k a month
@Jerma985 You need to make a superman cartoon
@Jerma985 What's the name of this game?
Jerma is the only person I watch on Twitch
S E E R I N G jermaVenus jermaVenus

I'm a fan of the streamer and I hate this game
@Jerma985 can you turn off the game audio please?
@Jerma985 There is a 9-10 hour sex scene
Jerma, this is just the game. You have to fight the boss to progress.
@Jerma985 I'm going to play the game for the rest of the night :)
@Jerma985 the

SourPls DON'T GO OUT AND START THE STREAM SourPls
i don't know if you know or not
@Jerma985 Just make sure the title isnt a joke, it's a scam
@Jerma985 please don't tell me you have to save the lady LUL
DREW CREW IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MAKES FUN OF YOU
i dont want to see this guy play a game
yeah i guess so too, you got one of those at a mall
Jerma's gonna get timed out for saying the N word
I've never seen a good mac n cheese
@Jerma985 I'm gonna have to go to bed and wake up to you screaming at your wife
I'm going to shit if you don't beat this game
I'm so sorry for the man, Jerma. But you're in a better place than this.
I think this guy is too cool to be in a Jerma Rumble
jerma you are the only person I want to watch
I'm in the same boat as you. I don't want you to be on the island
This is the most insane shit I've ever seen
jerma is not going to get to the other one
I think you're gonna get a wierd facecam
@Jerma985 this is the dark souls of rhythm heaven
@Jerma985 you should do it in a row, the stream is gonna be good
It's not a joke, you're doing it wrong
i wish i could have a perfect timelord
this is what i think of when i say "pink"
@Jerma985 You can get a far more powerful version of the P-R-S-E-T
oh my god the fucking one with the facecam
I'm going to have to have a full ass meal
@Jerma985 it's like the beginning of a movie
@Jerma985 I think you are the one with the spell
@Jerma985 the boomer in the back looks like he's a super nerd
I'm a little worried for you Jerma, you're not gonna get any viewers
what does the guy in the bottom right have to do with it?
Jerma, you're going to die to the Abyss Watchers and get the boots
you can't make a full game out of this
the reason why you can't use the healing spell is because you're not a true gamer
that's why you're getting an A+ from me
@Jerma985 The original Dead Rising is a decent game
why are you on this level of a game
how long does it take to make a bald coin?
HE'S GETTING A FURRY AND HIS CHICKEN ON HIS HEAD
@Jerma985 you can't have a long leash on your old stuff
you can't tell the difference between a 1 and a 0
The only time I'd like to see a game with a soundtrack is for people who don't know what a "music" is
@Jerma985 have you ever had the yo-yo for a reason?
@Jerma985 PLEASE DO IT I CAN'T STAND THIS SHIT
Jerma is actually a fucking psycho, he doesn't give a fuck about our expectations
Can you tell us the time? :) @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You can buy the amazon store at the carnival for $20
It's like the entire world is on the line
@Jerma985 if you put the money in your pockets you'll get a free sub
@Jerma985 Just got here. What the fuck is happening
Oh god the new joker movie is just a fucking hell of a movie
jerma is going to be so disappointed in his performance
@Jerma985 When are you going to play the new Mount & Blade game?
@Jerma985 I think you should play the old game
he's not gonna be able to beat this level because he's not in the new game
@Jerma985 it's been like an hour since the last stream
@Jerma985 You can't be a professional in this game
this is a really good way to start a stream
this is why you don't have a tv
I'm going to die from the stress of this game
@Jerma985 Do you have a gamecube to play as?
You can't just be a pog guy and not eat a shoe
jerma has been in a coma for 5 years
He's been playing this for like 6 hours
@Jerma985 when is the next carnival stream?
@Jerma985 can you go back to the old days?
@Jerma985 jermaPluto jermaOneguy please I'm just here to watch jerma's old videos

Jerma what kind of ass is this guy?

He’s just playing as the dog to make up for his lack of intelligence
@Jerma985 no, you have to buy them
@Jerma985 why is there a third character on the screen?
you can change it in the game settings

I'm glad you're not a pog streamer jermaHeart
@Jerma985 play as the elephant and the tiger
@Jerma985 do you not know how to use a controller?
@Jerma985 You need to wait until you get to the black hole before you can get it
Jerma is going to be the one that loses to pinwheel

GTA5 is the best game ever made by a game company

@Jerma985 Will you be playing the game tonight?
@Jerma985 Please stop you're getting so angry at the game
I like how the game is saying "what if"
I've never seen a city like this before
It's not like you're going to get a heart attack, it's just going to be a little too easy for you
I wish I could play this game on my phone
@Jerma985 can we get a face cam of you in the back
this game is too hard for you guys
jermaWalk WE'RE GOING TO GET DREW jermaWalk
jerma should stop pretending and just play games with real people
I think you can use the flashlight with your back
@Jerma985 you have to press the button to make it go to the next area
i cant believe this streamer is actually a boomer
you don't have to make a lot of money
@Jerma985 you're supposed to let the kid out
if you could stop playing this game for a second i would
This is the future of your career jerma
@Jerma985 You're gonna get sued by the IRS
@Jerma985 please don't make a minecraft mod for this
I'm a true gamer and I am not happy with this
@Jerma985 what do you think about dennis from the new vegas stream?
you have to find the other ones to find them
I was a baby and I'm still here
JERMA YOU NEED TO PLAY DOG BOY ON STREAM
I can't wait to see Jerma play a game that isnt a childrens game
I can't wait for the next Jerma Rumble
@Jerma985 Do you think the thing is good for you?
Jerma how do you get a job on a boat
this is the type of game you would play
oh my god its literally the farthest one from the heart
do you know how many people have died to pinwheel
@Jerma985 don't do it. Just do it anyway.
@Jerma985 the first time you did this was with a doll
i can't believe they named this game after the first one
@Jerma985 you can put it in the freezer, it's frozen
@Jerma985 get the ass kicked out of you
this is the worst stream of 2020 LUL
@Jerma985 you're supposed to hit the buttons to move
he's not gonna do it, he's gonna die.
i'm actually really glad i have this channel
@Jerma985 do you know what a free ipad is?
I was gone for a few hours and this is still going on
Is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
Jerma, the one thing you can do is buy a gun
@Jerma985 I don't think you can use the trigger, I think you can turn it off with the middle mouse button
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 5 YEARS
we have to get rid of the jermapolises now
Jerma, did you say "A-A-A" or "A-A-A"
@Jerma985 you can see the dicaster's eyes in the bottom left
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU ARE GOING TO MURDER THE GREEKS

Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -156. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
@Jerma985 PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR BASE ON THE TRAILER
I was watching you and I was worried for your health
@Jerma985 You can't even get a boat for this game
@Jerma985 you can take it back to the house
this is the kind of game where you have to save a bunch of people
@Jerma985 is
====================
the last one is a fucking goldfish
@Jerma985 we're just gonna listen to him, he's been playing this for like 2 hours
jerma, i just got here, are you going to play the new game?
@Jerma985 I like how the sound effects are coming out
@Jerma985 You have to go to the first level to unlock the secret
you can't stop the voice changer from being in your ear LUL
i'm not even gonna do anything to your health anymore
I've never heard of a good alternative to jerma's streams
Why does this guy have a brain hole in his head
oh you think it's a secret? I thought it was a secret
the only thing you can do is ignore the first part of the boss
you gotta have some passion for the game and be able to stay up for hours
I can't believe jerma died to pinwheel on stream

The way he speaks is pretty good. Like he has a really good vocabulary

@Jerma985 This is not the real show, the show is fake
@Jerma985 this is the worst time to eat
jerma, did you ever tell a kid that you could make money with a little money?
I feel like the whole joke just wasn't funny
he just forgot to put the money on the card
I don't think you can just have a one guy event.
@Jerma985 you can go to the first floor of the house and there's a secret room
YOU CAN JUST GIVE HIM A FREE MACHINE

@Jerma985 I'm a sub and I don't get it
The only way to get rid of the wall is to have a big pile of shit
we need to get some more animals for the frogs
@Jerma985 you can jump over the thing if you have it on your back
@Jerma985 you can't run away if you don't have the red light
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to play the game for a while
@Jerma985 use the vive to get the camera
I'm gonna eat my sandwich, I’ll get a COW
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to do it in the first place
I would be a good streamer if I were you
@Jerma985 this is the guy that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 You need to be in the middle of the road
Why is the chat so slow to play this game
can you do a 4 player run
That's how you get your daughter to beat the game
How do you feel about people getting addicted to the game?
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO HIT THE LIGHTS INSTEAD
I like how the voice actors are all playing a different game
I had no idea this game was in the works
jerma why are you so mean to your audience
why do you need to be a doctor
there's a chandelier in the basement, that gives you a hint
@Jerma985 will you play the sequel to this?
I think you need to use the stones to get to the next part of the level
@Jerma985 Put the entire store in the museum and then go to the next one
@Jerma985 your character is going to die in the first room
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you get an A in a game LUL
I can't believe Jerma is making fun of me for being a furry
@Jerma985 you need to set the water to 25%
@Jerma985 are you going to play the next game?

jermaOld I remember when the real Jerma died jermaOld
why did you get so many drugs in this game?
@Jerma985 why do you hate the seagulls so much?
@Jerma985 when will you play the doom ost?
YOU'RE SO BAD AT THIS GAME YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A HES PLAYING A GAME YOU'RE NOT

@Jerma985 You need to be able to kill the first enemy
i think it's a little too much to ask
i'm just gonna say that the game is a little too easy
JERMA ITS EMBARRASSING THE TRUTH WE CAN SEE THE MOST
I don't know why, I think it's like you're playing a game for kids
@Jerma985 please add a colonoscopy to the stream
@Jerma985 are you going to play a multiplayer game?
@Jerma985 you should put the video on a big screen, that's where the audio is coming from
I'd like to see him play the game, he has an unedited version
@Jerma985 You gotta do a 12 hour stream
@Jerma985 why would you be so bad at this game
@Jerma985 what are you even doing here
jermaWalk I WAS THERE WHEN YOU WERE LATE
This is the best stream I've ever seen
you need to click on the seagulls to get more
I'm not gonna lie, I don't know how to explain it
@Jerma985 this game is too violent and chaotic for you
@Jerma985 you have to make the other one an emote
he was the first person to do that
Jerma is gonna be a big boy in a video game
@Jerma985 You should be able to play as the giant rat
@Jerma985 Just make a new save file and put it in the main menu
I know it's probably a bad idea but, at least he's not going to play it
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to shoot the boss
I can't believe I was a sub jermaVenus
@Jerma985 don't worry, the game will be in the next 10 minutes.
@Jerma985 you have to get the coin, it's just a pop
I mean he's going to be a robot for a while
@Jerma985 Just like the other day, when I was watching the stream, you kept saying "jeez, it's like a family guy"
this is the last time i watch your streams
@Jerma985 You can use the new ability to level up
if you die in the game you die in real life
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, I'm still waiting for the next Jerma Rumble.
@Jerma985 PLEASE DONT FORGET THE FAILED MAN
@Jerma985 will you be streaming with Etalyx on Saturday?
Jerma I just got here, did he play MGS5?

@Jerma985 why are you playing this? Is it bad?
The fucking ed edd eddy movie is a fucking ripoff
@Jerma985 you can turn off the radio
is it just me or does this game look like it's in english
this is a really bad game for kids
====================
The real answer is not to buy it, but to buy it at a discount
I'm gonna go to sleep, do I have to be in the next 30 minutes?
@Jerma985 I'm still waiting on the green screen stream, I can't see it anymore
it was a bit of a mess, but it was fun
@Jerma985 How many times have you watched the rat movie?
This is a pretty good game, I would love to see some of the art in it
it's not a great game but it's good
why do you have to make this so easy
you know what they say about the "i think it was made for a children"
@Jerma985 you need to get to the top of the hill to get a full stack of gold
jerma is the only person who can change the world
if you dont have a wink i will cry
I thought you were in the car LUL
@Jerma985 you need to get the golden key first
@Jerma985 You are a lotta shit in the future
i know it's a joke, but you just look at it
@Jerma985 if you put a metal plate on the floor you can literally touch it and it'll stay there for 5 seconds
you have to do the second part of the level
theres so many people in this chat now
@Jerma985 you can't actually die to pinwheel without killing him
jerma you should put on your boots, you're too short to be naked and therefore cant see through them
@Jerma985 Have you ever been to a concert
that was the guy who made the bad reviews
I'm sorry I didn't get to see the greenscreen video
I don't know what this is but I love it
@Jerma985 You don't need to walk around the whole map

"You gotta make a house for us" - Jerma985
@Jerma985 This game is too easy for you
its like you're a dad trying to teach you how to play

@Jerma985 I think it's a little too loud for you

@Jerma985 go to the cave and talk to the other guy
@Jerma985 You can't just take out the cards
Hey Jerma, I heard you're a furry, what do you think of the furry lifestyle?
@Jerma985 you have to eat the left side of the screen
jermaPluto it's okay, I don't have to tell you
You can tell when Jerma is about to die because he's scared of his own death
Oh hey, I just got here. What happened?
jermaWalk WE WANT A BOOTS JERMA WE WANT A BOOTS jermaWalk
I was watching a stream and I was like "Is this the streamer who died to Pinwheel? jermaVenus "
I got a new sub from Jerma985, he can't get it
theres a dildo in the pool right now
it's not a big deal, just you can change it in the menu
The dude that makes all of the rules is just a jealous asshole
Jerma can't stop his balls from spilling out of his ass
He's gonna die to pinwheel, he's gonna die to pinwheel.
@Jerma985 you gotta get the other one on the right

@Jerma985 You can't beat the story for the first one
this is just the tutorial level in the first level

@Jerma985 You got the perfect time to use it
Jerma is a one-guy streamer. He has a tendency to be mean to his viewers.
@Jerma985 why are you so angry that your internet is out
@Jerma985 The first thing you do is take a shot and shoot the ball
You have to do it in the first place
@Jerma985 Just get a new bike, this one is an improvement

This is the kind of game you'd play for 10 hours
@Jerma985 There's a LOT of stuff to see, it's a lot of content
I'm going to watch a live stream, I can't wait for the streamer to finish
The combat is just like that one episode of Shark Tank
jermaDisgust I can't even tell what it is
@Jerma985 I like the way you're trying to make it sound like you're not actually doing anything
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE THEM MORE CASH
I like the word "high" because it's just a little bit of slang
Jerma, you can save the game with a save point.
jermaPluto he wont do it again jermaPluto
this is the worst way to make money
@Jerma985 Just use the shitty tony hawk game

@Jerma985 You can place the rocks in the water and it'll grow
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure what I'm talking about.
@Jerma985 did you know that the ukulele is the only one that moves
@Jerma985 There's a secret in the next level
@Jerma985 You're not even in the game, you're just playing this
@Jerma985 you can get the ladder to the bottom
what if we're all in a simulation of Jerma
i mean the funnyman is still in it
jerma you're going to need to pay for the next one
@Jerma985 you don't need to be a streamer to watch it
@Jerma985 You should make a coop with the other mods

@Jerma985 what is your opinion on the color pink?
he doesn't even know what the song is LUL

@Jerma985 can you just make the whole stream a full movie?
I just got here what the hell is this game
Did you ever see the movie? I remember the movie was pretty good
@Jerma985 I wouldnt buy it if it was a physical copy
I cant believe the music is just an echo of the game
there's a lot of games that dont have a single one that doesnt have a music track
this is the most disgusting stream I've ever seen
@Jerma985 Why are you talking about your feet
did you see the jerma face on the screen?
I need to get out of this hell

JERMA THIS IS A COWARD I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MY BABY
You know he doesn't know about the power of the internet
I don't have a Kinect, but I'm going to play some games with the game controller jermaVenus
Did you know that the 3D TV is a real thing
Jerma, it's a secret mission in the game

is it just me or does the game sound weird
Jerma is the type of guy to play games with his mind and not his body
@Jerma985 you need to turn off the mic, it's too loud
@Jerma985 JERMA ISN'T AS GOOD AS YOU
@Jerma985 you can turn on the light to see if it's bright

I'm sure they're doing it to prove it
@Jerma985 "It's a shame that people can't play games that are fun"
you have to be on the right side
@Jerma985 What are you doing with that money?
@Jerma985 Get a bunch of snowmen and throw them all at them
how long have you been playing this game?
@Jerma985 can you play this game for the rest of the stream?
@Jerma985 I have a theory that the worst part is that you have to wait for the big boss to be done
@Jerma985 if you do the "I can't get out of the house" joke again
I got a 3rd one for the price of one
Can't wait for the official announcement about the next big jerma rumble
@Jerma985 I have a good reason to be happy
@Jerma985 theres a chance for you to get sued

@Jerma985 You got to the top of the first level

It's too early to say if the stream is starting soon
@Jerma985 you're doing a good job, you're just an idiot.

Jerma is the type of guy to let his emotions out
i have a headache, it's not my fault

I can't believe Jerma is actually playing this game, I just got here
Is this the streamer that got spooked by a statue?
this game is way too hard for jerma

you have to go to the sewer to find it
jerma, you can't just keep going, you have to kill the enemy first
@Jerma985 try to go back to the beginning
@Jerma985 use the lightning to get the boots
@Jerma985 When you get a freebie, can you tell me what it is?

It's like you're trying to make a movie
@Jerma985 that's just the clip of a guy fucking up his door
did you know that there are tons of shirts in the park
I'm watching this stream with my other eyes
what the hell are you doing in that room
Hey guys, just wanted to let you know that Jerma is not a racist.
@Jerma985 remember to charge your shot when you're near the wall
@Jerma985 You should play some Call of Pripyat, it's the only good one

imagine having your gamer license revoked by a government that doesn't want to admit that they're bigots
@Jerma985 It's like you're trying to make a movie about a new country
i think the first few episodes of this were pretty good
I'm gonna get a ton of sleep so bad that i'm gonna be late for school

hey guys what's the joke i just got here?
the one guy who can't get it LUL
@Jerma985 I will be your best friend, please don't let me go
this is like watching someone actually beat dark souls 3 on stream
the only good thing about this game is that you can use the railgun for your attacks
I want to get off your fucking wild ride
I didn't know you had that many subs
i can't believe you're still doing this
I'm gonna be honest, I really enjoyed this game
it's a real good game, but the gameplay isnt as fun as it could be.
the thing about the movie is that the original was a full film
I've never been to a cinema before, it's kinda creepy

@Jerma985 You need to turn off the lock on your door

@Jerma985 You have to press the rock in the box
@Jerma985 Do you have a gun that can shoot zombies?

@Jerma985 You can still get a special boss in the dungeon
Jerma you should just let the real you play the game

Died to the first boss of a Street Fighter game
i have never heard of this game and i love it
I'm trying to get the first one but I can't because of the speed

He’s not coming back until you get the boots
@Jerma985 You can do a double jump on the way back

@Jerma985 You can combine your red hearts with your gold
@Jerma985 You can use the boots to kill the boss
@Jerma985 you have to hold the door open for the cutscene
@Jerma985 I think you're just a little different
@Jerma985 you can do this to yourself with your real life experience
i feel like it's in a pretty obvious place
Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?

Jerma i just got here. what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 You can get a shield by using a shortcut
@Jerma985 why does the streamer look like a skeleton
====================
@Jerma985 The Vroomer is a real psycho, he is constantly reminding you to play it and the game is a lie
it's like you're playing a game of doki doki
you're not even playing the game, you're just doing it in your head
@Jerma985 put on a dark theme so we can see what you're talking about
@Jerma985 You should play the games you like because they're all so good

I think it's time to give it some attention
If you think Jerma is good at this game, you're wrong.
@Jerma985 the stream is still going on? what are you on about
is that a fucking bird you just shot?
I cant believe Jerma is the kind of guy who would do this to himself
@Jerma985 did you actually make the noise of the book?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1446. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I don't know how to explain this, but I'm sure it's a little bit of the game
Can't wait for the "nice voice acting" joke
If you have a Jerma985 DVD player, you can play this with it
@Jerma985 If you play this game and not the other one, you're not the real jerma
@Jerma985 it's a game about a kid in a swimming pool
it's the same as the gamecube game

Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1142. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 Is it just me or is the webcam more than 2 inches?

@Jerma985 do you still have the ipad? i need it for my school
@Jerma985 The only thing you can do is put on the blue and stick to the green.
it's the height of the audience, so you're gonna get a lot of lost viewers
Jerma if you can eat a shoe, can you eat a food?
Why are you always so mad at the same joke
jerma should do a greenscreen stream where he plays the game for 10 hours
You need to have a goal and put it on the map.
@Jerma985 you have to do the puzzles first
@Jerma985 i got the app to play it but i cant play it

I'm a little worried about you, just play the game
@Jerma985 you can turn off the voice modulation
jerma is literally just playing an old arcade game

I wonder if I can make the stream work.

I had to get up to watch the stream, I can't stand watching jerma
I have to go to work tomorrow. I'm scared. jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can drag and drop them on the ground
Is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?

You have to run to the right of the pylon
I thought it was just the DLC for the game
I think this is a great game, you should play it on your own
@Jerma985 I'm gonna go do some fishing and watch the stream tomorrow

I can't believe jerma just used a dead body to make a fucking sandwich
@Jerma985 is there any way to get a second island?
@Jerma985 use the arrow keys to dash around
jerma you can do that without getting hit by the bullets
This is like when you're a baby and the baby cries
he cant get out of the room
@Jerma985 You're going to get arrested, not going to be able to get out
@Jerma985 You can now upgrade your inventory to the right
@Jerma985 you can stop the game now, youre a zombie

@Jerma985 the first time you made a joke in chat was like 2 minutes ago, and you're still doing it, right?
you dont have to do it you just have to go through the door
I just got back, did Jerma beat the first level?
jermaChomp 📣 i want to hear this message again
@Jerma985 what if you put a bomb in the basement?
why does it look like the small guy in the game
I'm watching a Jerma stream today and I can't stop farting
You should have a book for each and every one
i thought you were gonna say that as a joke
I know what I'm talking about, you're not even paying attention
@Jerma985 you can pick up a sword and put it on the ground
@Jerma985 Why are you saying that? I thought it was a joke
@Jerma985 you're a short guy, you can do this without having a ladder
@Jerma985 hey jerma i just got here what the fuck is happening
YOU HAD A DAD TOLD YOU TO LEAVE
@Jerma985 Did you know you can do this without a ladder?
I'll be honest, I'm glad I was able to catch a live stream
It's probably like a half life game
oh no jerma is going to get a heart attack
@Jerma985 it's in the subreddit right now.
its a shitty garbage bar right there jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 if you dont get the high score you can't win
can you get a top hat for the controller?
You can't just let a kid go in the shower
imagine getting on a plane in this game LUL
@Jerma985 This is a good thing, you know.
I had a dream you would go to sleep on a cloud
@Jerma985 you have to be very careful to not fall in the traps
@Jerma985 do you have any mods that will ban people for being in chat?
i just realized i didn't know he was a boomer
@Jerma985 I am going to take a nap for the next hour. jermaPluto
@Jerma985 I just noticed you are streaming on Twitch.
@Jerma985 it's a bit of a knockoff of this game
If you're not careful you'll get a heart attack
jermaWalk I want to see you get out of the elevator jermaWalk
@Jerma985 I'm a dentist, you can't just say "well"
@Jerma985 there's a side door that opens up into a different area
I wish I could be a mod :)
@Jerma985 You have to put them in the air
@Jerma985 you need to do a COCKROPPIN LUL
Jerma's gonna be late for the stream :(
It's like the Doki Doki Literature Club show
@Jerma985 you need to throw them into the hole
It was the old man from the diner
@Jerma985 there's a massive amount of people who watch you and you don't even know what the game is, you're just doing it
@Jerma985 I'M GONNA BE THE SAME DAY FOR THE NAKED STREAM
"Hey, what do you want from me?" -Jerma985
they had to put a block under it
@Jerma985 don't forget to remove the arm

@Jerma985 You can't just say the one you want to
@Jerma985 he is the one who made this
I thought you were gonna say the end of stream joke
jerma i would like to see you play some games
@Jerma985 What are you gonna do with all your money?
@Jerma985 A channel is a place where people interact
i'm sure you're pretty good at this game
I think he said he's doing a new joke
the only reason he's not a streamer is because he's in the bath
you can do it with a ladder if you have a ladder
@Jerma985 if you have a thing you can actually climb the ladder
is this the
====================
This is how we build a nuclear winter and we're all dead now :)

It's like if you were in the room
you don't have to be a chad to join the club
how did jerma get past the screen of a black hole
@Jerma985 Are you going to play the rest of the games?
I can't believe Jerma is playing FNAF VR jermaPluto
if you keep drinking it will go away
@Jerma985 YOU CAN GO TO THE DINNER AND GET THE PICY
@Jerma985 you can press X and Y to skip the boss
you can tell he's going to die if you look at the ceiling
@Jerma985 You're gonna be bad at this game
I know a guy who can make that
jermaDafoe "I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom"
i cant believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
jermaSun why are you playing this shitty game?
I just got here and jerma's still on this level NotLikeThis
is this the guy who beat mambo 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 you can use the wind to turn it off
@Jerma985 There is no way to lose without the ring
I can't believe the government doesn't think you're cool
@Jerma985 I thought you were going to say "Just play it"
@Jerma985 They are, I'm sure they have a lot of lore
he's gonna play this game again jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can't just stream in a few days
I hope he has some of those "Thanks for the gift sub" stuff
I can't believe jerma is going to get the PBR
@Jerma985 i have no idea what this is
@Jerma985 The cow has to be a big one
It's a website that lets you see a list of all the available games
jerma you should play my favorite game, The Last of Us.
its like the first time in a game and they're not even in chat
@Jerma985 I'm a little old so I think you need to know how to draw
@Jerma985 you can't make fun of me for being a dick
@Jerma985 Play the game I'm watching :) @Jerma985
Jerma, what's up with your hair? I just got here.
@Jerma985 can you stop with the fart joke
I think you should just try to kill him
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure this is a scripted game
This is a bit too close to the actual game.
the first thing i hear in the bathroom is jerma, "Hey I'm back"
@Jerma985 did you know that the WHOLE Super Mario Maker 2
That's the part where you ask her to come over
jermaPluto I'm not a dumbass but I'm a big dumbass
@Jerma985 There's a zombie in the back that just jumps in the door
jerma is a great entertainer, he's a very funny guy
@Jerma985 what's the most boring thing you've ever done
The real thing is the drug dealer is gonna get shot
@Jerma985 You need to build a house with all the tools you can
@Jerma985 how much do you charge for a tutorial?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -176. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I can't believe Jerma is still streaming jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You can't put the tree in the middle of the road
@Jerma985 can you turn the stream on so i can watch a vod?
Why is the car in the middle of the road
You have to get the meat to sell
The only thing I know about this game is that it's like a kid playing with his toys
@Jerma985 we can't tell which is your face
I am not even sure if he's still playing this or not
jermaWalk I’m gonna have to go to the bathroom jermaWalk
jermaWalk I'm going to get kicked out of the stream jermaWalk
you're going to get shot by the giant enemy spider
I'm gonna get a heart attack, I can't wait to watch this
@Jerma985 Thats the one from the original movie
@Jerma985 you're going to have to do this again
is that a picture of you? @Jerma985
JERMA WOULD BE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS A JERMA LUL
He's in the bathroom, he's not even in the water
@Jerma985 you can see it in the

JERMA HAS A BAD JOB, HE NEVER FOUGHT D:
I can't believe this is the guy who beat MGS2 on stream
@Jerma985 put it on your face, your face is gonna look weird
You guys are the worst part of this stream
I can't believe the "jermaWalk" is on this stream
@Jerma985 how do you know that's not a typo?
Jerma if you want to beat the game, you have to do the whole game
@Jerma985 YOU'RE A MAN IN YOUR HEARTS, STOP PUTTING SHES IN YOUR EYES
@Jerma985 you can go to the new house to get a new weapon
this is the most frustrating video game moment of the year
@Jerma985 I'm gonna need a new shirt :)
@Jerma985 play the episode where you have to take out a loan
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not
I don't think that's what they're saying, if you're going to say something that's "I'm not going to be able to see you" you can't be telling them that
you're supposed to be a noob in the game
Did you see the new "jerma985" emote on the discord?
You are, the audio is all broken. Please restart the game.
oh my god this is the end of the game
@Jerma985 jerma can you turn the stream off im watching you
this is what you get for being a racist asshole
I remember when the internet was free and I thought it was just a thing
its the same thing with the movie LUL
@Jerma985 you can do a reverse and play the original
Jerma are you going to play a little game where you play as a clown?
@Jerma985 YOU'RE A MAN IN YOUR HEARTS, STOP PUTTING SHES IN YOUR EYES jermaWalk
How long has Jerma been streaming since the carnival stream?
if you do a reverse you get a free controller
theres gonna be like a few of us getting turned into a hivemind and being able to create stuff
jermaPluto i dont know how to feel jermaPluto
@Jerma985 I think this is a really cool map
@Jerma985 Do you still have the DS3 disc?
This is just a full horror game @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You can only be in the second location
BEST JOKE OF THE DECADE JERMA jermaVenus
he's going to be the one to say "get off my lawn"
its so weird seeing all these people LUL
You can turn the game off and play it again
@Jerma985 you're going to have to fix the audio in the first 2 or 3 levels.
I remember when this was a Japanese stream.
The guy that was supposed to be cooking a lasagna is coming back to life
@Jerma985 The game is playing with you in a new game
@Jerma985 what do you think about the lead?
I don't know what to think of the stream
@Jerma985 Do you think you'll play a more famous game?
Why does jerma look like a vampire
I just got here what the hell is going on
How did you get into this game? @Jerma985
i was just gonna say "but my dad is a fucking idiot"
this is the guy who beat Star Wars on stream
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel
I dont think I can ever do this
@Jerma985 PLEASE DONT MAKE FUN OF HIM FOR THIS
@Jerma985 if you don't like the game, you're a liar
I think they're just gonna be like "oh i see this guy"
I'm so glad you have the patience to listen to the music
Jerma is going to be fucking dead in 10 minutes
you gotta kill him or he'll be a fucking dead person
@Jerma985 Jerma is in the bathroom, turn off the stream, and have a rest of the game played!
i was the one who made this game and now i'm the one who made the guide
I hope Jerma makes a video for the new emote
I mean, you're supposed to just do it
@Jerma985 you can't have a shitty car
I was just about to say it. It's not a Jerma stream.
you can do
====================
@Jerma985 if you want to go to the beach you should go to the beach
@Jerma985 You need to be a master of improv.
You can do it to me right now
Why is he dressed like he's talking to a vampire?
it was a jup that came out of his ass
@Jerma985 You should do an improv stream on stream.
@Jerma985 If you get to the top of the tree, you can jump over it
@Jerma985 I think you missed the top of the tower
you need to go back to the other house
@Jerma985 you don't need to save him, you just need to bring him back to life
@Jerma985 Put your hand up your ass
you need to put the controller in a position that makes the controller easier
@Jerma985 what the hell is a real shoe
@Jerma985 Please stop doing the facecam joke, it's distracting.
@Jerma985 you're going to have to do the gremlins
@Jerma985 you can't have too many people on the floor, there's too many people in the room
@Jerma985 I'm sorry, I had to cancel my plan to go to the store. I'm sure you can do better with the "I'm sorry" one
If you get to the top of the tree you can jump over it
jerma has to be a master of comedy
@Jerma985 Please get rid of the JUP, it's not funny anymore
Jerma is a psychopath, he's a serial killer
jerma, if you lose this game I'll eat your ass
@Jerma985 you should do a post-stream chat stream where you don't even talk to the chat
i love this game but i want to play it again
@Jerma985 How many people are watching this in the background?
I'm gonna get a refund, I think it's an achievement.
that's just the way it is in the game
you should do a ghost for the moon
@Jerma985 that was a really good joke I can't believe it
@Jerma985 You can get a new weapon for the boss
@Jerma985 you need to get a saddle, it's a mine
how do you get a nice ass and not a tree?
I wish I could be that guy who spent all his money on a shoe
@Jerma985 the rat is the leader of the group
@Jerma985 It's like you're a caveman on the outside
This is the only game that doesn't let you do any of these
I hope Jerma doesn't turn into a furry
I like how the streamer is the only person that doesn't know what a fireman is
@Jerma985 i was the one who said i was gonna go out and get a pack of cigarettes and get myself a pack of cigarettes and i never came back
@Jerma985 Hey, I think you'll like the game. Thanks for all the love!
That's just a huge stick of butter, don't use it
Jerma you're the type of person that just shits in the sink
@Jerma985 do you have the clip of the frog?
I'm just imagining this streamer with a meltdown in the second game, he just goes "no I'm not gonna do this"
i thought this was a normal stream LUL
Why is there a little girl in the background?
@Jerma985 That's not true, the guy who made the paperclip has been in there for 10 years
@Jerma985 Do you have the book that teaches you how to draw?
@Jerma985 you need to use your tail to get in the way
@Jerma985 You're the only one that uses the counter
@Jerma985 the burger king store is a good place to get your shit together
I have to go to work today :)
@Jerma985 What's the name of the other person?
jermaWalk I want to see the money jermaWalk
I'm surprised you don't have a flute with a flute in it
jermaWalk YOU CAN DO IT JERMA! WE'RE GOING TO LAUGH jermaWalk
Jerma is gonna be late, I'm guessing he'll be in time for the carnival stream
the penis is just a tiny emo penis
@Jerma985 Your mic is too high pitched for this game
@Jerma985 you can jump on the boat to get out of the water
the jerma's stream was a nice trip and he is still here
"I'm the one who says no" jermaVenus
@Jerma985 can you play the super bowl
@Jerma985 Play a little bit of the ghost house
jermaOld Back in my day we could just eat our own
====================
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A PYTHON IS THEY JUST KNOW IT'S A PYTHON
Jerma you're the best streamer on twitch! Thanks for all the years of entertainment!
the red dead is the end of the story
i was just about to say it but i can see why
i thought you were talking about us jermaSun
why does he have a warhammer sword like that
@Jerma985 i can't believe you're a furry now :(
I just got here, is this the streamer that beat hulk in the first try?
@Jerma985 make a joke about how this is a game where you can't do shit like this, and it's gonna make your life hell
@Jerma985 Please don't make this so that we can't have fun.
The name is Jerma. That's how you're meant to say it
Jerma I got a free copy of the game tonight from a Steam sale, did I miss it?
@Jerma985 This is the worst video ever made
@Jerma985 It's been so long since I've seen that, I can't see how you could make it this long.
Jerma is such a good dad he just needs a diaper
I've got the whole thing on the line
@Jerma985 what are the options on how to play this game?
@Jerma985 it's the "PogChamp" stream jermaVenus is the best
i hope we get to see jerma in his new house
i got the game on my switch and i still have no idea what's going on
jerma should be able to pay for his own internet
@Jerma985 can you explain how to play this game
@Jerma985 I'm just trying to be nice to you :)
@Jerma985 You're gonna be a real loser when you die
this guy is an asshole, he even went to a dentist to get rid of that tooth
@Jerma985 You have to tell her to turn off the lights
this is the same guy who said he wanted to make a game for children
Can't wait for the Half Life 2 update
this is the best game i have ever seen
i just got back from my birthday and jerma is still on the same spot LUL
i hope jerma has a good night jermaHeart
I’m a furry, i love this game, and i love this game, but it’s hard to admit it.
@Jerma985 do you have a VRP controller?
@Jerma985 you should know how to read the d word
I just got here and this is the best joke I have ever seen
It's really bad at first but it's really good
@Jerma985 you have to do the thing again
this is literally the first time you've said that
how are you still playing this LUL
i just joined, what is going on? LUL
This is what it feels like to be a kid
jerma should play the dlc for this
You can't get a good beat on this game
@Jerma985 that's just the way he is
I have no idea what I'm talking about
@Jerma985 Do you think you'll ever play Lord of the rings?
@Jerma985 You're not a real gamer, this is your dream
I'm still trying to figure out how to play this game
I'm a furry, I love this game, and i love this game, but it’s hard to admit it. jermaHeart
you have to put it on the ground for people to get hurt
@Jerma985 The game will run on DOS so you might be playing the wrong version
Just got here, is this the streamer that beat black michael?
@Jerma985 it's a stealth game, you're a bad guy

@Jerma985 how many people are there? what's the total number
this is the worst stream ive ever seen
I have a FIVE and a FIVE and a FIVE
@Jerma985 Are you going to play NGU Idle?
DUDE WHY IS THIS GAME A MANUAL LUL
i thought you were talking about us jermaSun
you're gonna get hit by a car again
@Jerma985 You're like "why are you in a haunted house"
@Jerma985 You can use the item slot to buy more, so you can unlock more
LUL I was a kid and never got to the end of this game
this is the dark souls of horror games
I'm sorry, but you have to be careful with your camera.
I can't believe this is the man who beat the first boss of Mario
why is he still doing this?
====================
@Jerma985 What do you think about the sonic games?
@Jerma985 There's a box that can get you back
@Jerma985 theres a box next to the door you can use as a shield
@Jerma985 you have to play a lot of games at once to get the full experience
@Jerma985 They're not going to make a game for you
What are you supposed to do with that money
you need to be in the house to get the ring
this is like watching a really bad movie
jermaPop This is your father, I swear to god
i hate jermaPluto but i love jerma
@Jerma985 How do you feel about the new Jerma update?
@Jerma985 Are you gonna stream the new season of Star Wars?
its not the height of a dog, it's the height of a cat
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma I just joined the stream can you pause the stream please
@Jerma985 you can hold to make a loop to the next step
@Jerma985 can you not hold the keys to the keyboard for the entire game
I think Jerma has some really bad taste in games
@Jerma985 I'll be the giant rat that makes all of the rules
@Jerma985 you can click on the camera to get the achievement
I thought that was a different emote, not sure
the only thing worse than a tony hawk shirt is a random shirt
@Jerma985 Your nails look like the side of a car
Jerma you have to do the bad ending
jermaPluto jermaPluto this is the worst thing ive ever seen
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU NEED TO GO TO THE FIRST ONE
jerma why do you have a car with a seat
this game is way too realistic for me
Jerma is too busy fighting the psycho in the background
@Jerma985 You got the Quaker Bunch to beat this game
@Jerma985 That's a lot of money you've spent on a game
@Jerma985 no it's a little too soft
Can you get a picture of the top of the bowl?
jermaPluto why is jerma losing to this guy
he has to get the ring, he's got to make the joke
I got a gift sub last night :)
I think this is the streamer that actually died to pinwheel
jermaOld "I'm gonna use the toilet, I don't care"
I have a friend who is a pretty tall person, and she is 5'7"
SourPls OH GOD JERMA YOU NEED TO STAY UP FOR THE SECOND STREAMS
I bet this guy is a former sports announcer, he would be happy to host someone on his stream
jermaChomp JERMA I'M NOT GETTING MY POTATO
i cant believe jerma is actually a good boy
Hey Jerma, what's your favorite game that I like? :)
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -558. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
The new "Goosecab" stream is pretty fun
You should probably eat a bunch of apples
@Jerma985 Why are you so mad that you've been doing this for 3 days
this is like watching a kid play with toys
Is he going to do a level or is he going to be in the next one
@Jerma985 Can we have a normal voice for this one
He's playing with a table, not a table
You should do a live stream where you can chat with your friends and make them play with you
@Jerma985 What if I want to go to the toilet and I don't know if it's safe to do so?
HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER DO IT D:
Jerma I'm gonna go to the bathroom, can you turn the stream off please?
@Jerma985 you have to do a little trick
I hope this isnt the last stream
jermaWalk i miss the old jerma jermaPluto
jermaPop I'm gonna be right back, I'm going to be right back
"That's not a good idea, that's a bad idea"
why does jerma look like he's been tortured
imagine if you were a pre-stream chat member
@Jerma985 What happened to the PC version of this?
@Jerma985 are you going to play the carnival game?
I just got here what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 you have to put a facecam in the background of the vid
it's just a regular game with more than 4 buttons
I never realized how much that was until I saw it
the hype train is going to be real soon
Oh my god, the stream is
====================
One of my favorite games is the Simpsons Hit and Run!
I cant believe you are playing this on your own
This is the dark souls of Super Mario RPG
you gotta get the camera closer to the camera
@Jerma985 How long is the stream going to go?
@Jerma985 If you don't buy it, you're not doing a good job
if you don't get it it will be so hard to find it
@Jerma985 You need to make your own lawn, like a pottery house
"The last time I played this game was when I was a kid"
I cant believe you've been playing this for 5 hours
@Jerma985 You have to pay for the next movie
This is a shitty game where you have to buy the game, that's what you get for doing this.
I bet you would have to throw it on the ground
@Jerma985 you can change the angle in the menu
The only time you can fight a boss is when you're literally in a room with a bunch of other bosses
@Jerma985 It's in the background of the game
@Jerma985 you need to make a map to find the castle
I have no idea what the fuck this is
so do you have a controller plugged in?
@Jerma985 will you be streaming the new doom ost?
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the new one?
I love how the first thing you do is spam the chat with weird shit like "O-oooooooooo AAAAE-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-I-A-JO-oooooooooooo
@Jerma985 you have to go to the third floor
i cant believe this streamer is not gonna be in this game
I'm still waiting for a gift sub LUL
I'm gonna miss the whole stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 He's like a baby and a baby
i don't even know what to do anymore
you need to upgrade the difficulty to make it easier for him
@Jerma985 I think you might have to leave
@Jerma985 you're not supposed to be in the castle
@Jerma985 Do you think you can hold it?
You need to do the QTE that puts you in the dungeon
@Jerma985 why is the powerline in the bottom left corner?
@Jerma985 you can see the last time you died
@Jerma985 get a book to read to you
You are so bad at this game OMEGALUL
i dont think i can even have a sub
@Jerma985 are you going to play this again?
@Jerma985 can you play more "dying to pinwheel"
What's the name of this game in the title?
is this the streamer that beat chibi robo on stream??
this is the worst game that has ever existed
this is the streamer that went to prison on the first day of the new year
@Jerma985 do you have any idea how many streams have gone by
"what are you doing on the xbox?" "this is the streamer that died to pinwheel"
Jerma is going to get a heart attack if he doesn't do the "JUMP KING" thing
@Jerma985 Do you need to buy the game?
I bet they are gonna be in the bathtub for like 15 minutes
LOOK AT THE MOUSE UNDER THE CHAIR monkaS
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -1. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 I would like to see you play it
Can't wait for the worst part of the stream
You look like the cat from catboy with a moustache
"LIFE IS PAIN, I CAN'T STOP" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 if you die you have to turn it back on
This guy is the best thing I have ever seen
jerma you're gonna
====================
@Jerma985 You don't have to use the lightning bolt, you can just hit it twice with the lightning bolt
he was going to play some doom ost
I'm gonna die in a million years :)
@Jerma985 it's not a black hole, it's a black hole
it's the real Jerma, he's the one who actually has to do this
@Jerma985 Just imagine the kind of thing you'd see in a real stream
I'm like 10 hours late and he's still playing this
Jerma you have to go back to the beginning to get the secret boss
It's a lot easier to make your own characters
@Jerma985 the first one is a little too loud, it makes you want to do more and it's just not worth it
he's going to have to do it in 2 hours
jermaOld when I get my own food I'm hungry
i just got here, is jerma going to play this?
@Jerma985 how many times has he been to your house
@Jerma985 you can't sell those on the black market
@Jerma985 if you have an army of soldiers you'll have a good army
you can't just throw things at them @Jerma985
you can see the lady's face in the bottom right corner
He’s just not as smart as a lot of his peers
@Jerma985 this is why we are here, to watch you play games
You can only play as the chopper, that's why you're called chopper
@Jerma985 you have to play the game again, its like you just want to see the ending
@Jerma985 that was a bit too long and didn't take too long
jermaSour when you're the one who loses to the vroomer
@Jerma985 just so you know, you're a bad streamer :)
jermaVenus just to be sure, the song is very fitting
@Jerma985 you gotta have some light to clear it up
@Jerma985 you need to get to the blue part
@Jerma985 how many times are we going to hear the dialogue?
Why is there a chibi robo character in this game?
@Jerma985 The thing that you were talking about was a good thing
@Jerma985 I think it's just a bug in the system
you can't just drive off the bridge LUL
@Jerma985 the thing is that you're not that good at this game
@Jerma985 There is a lot of people here right now
@Jerma985 This is gonna be a bit of a Jerma stream.
@Jerma985 it's the computer in the background
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LEFT FOR A LEG LUL
@Jerma985 Just because you're a good person doesn't mean you can't be bad
He's gonna be streaming for 8 hours straight LUL
i think you're going to get a lot of money
the video isnt even that good, it's just a bunch of little jerma clips
@Jerma985 if you keep getting hit by the bullet, you're gonna die
@Jerma985 you should do a countdown for the boss
The only way to save is to kill the boss
@Jerma985 it's not a good game, it's a good game.
It's like a ghost inside of you jerma
jermaOld i cant believe jerma is a god gamer
i think its just for the money
what if you have a pocket full of food
Jerma I just got here, is he going to play the game again?
I can't believe jerma's playing a simpsons game today
Oh god, it's the only one I'm watching
@Jerma985 this is the best stream of the year
@Jerma985 This is just a Furry Fortress, you should go live in two days
@Jerma985 Your stream is going to be like 3 hours long and you're going to lose subscriber
@Jerma985 can you turn off the stream for the last 2 hours?
This is a really good game, and you're going to need it to beat the first part of the story
this is the worst stream ive ever seen
I just got here, is Jerma going to play the game?
@Jerma985 why is your mom watching you? LUL
@Jerma985 you can change the color to red if you want
@Jerma985 what if you just punched into the wall?
@Jerma985 I think the first game is really cool
the average person has a beard that's like a pig's head
@Jerma985 this is just a one-off joke LUL
we have no idea what you're talking about
@Jerma985 you can get the last boss in the
====================
@Jerma985 I'm in the middle of the pool, what's the problem?
he's playing a game that's supposed to be scary
how do you think a horse will walk?
You need to beat the boss first, you can't skip it
You gotta put a facecam on the screen
the funny thing is jerma is not a true gamer
jermaOld I'll be a streamer for the next 12 hours
I mean, you can use a lot of paint, but it's a lot easier to get that kind of stuff done

@Jerma985 the time has come for you to move
@Jerma985 You need to do more running and dodging
@Jerma985 You can put a knock-off of the song

the real story is that you just got on a plane and it crashed into a wall
i think you have to do a 2nd stage
@Jerma985 i dont think the witch is as good as you
@Jerma985 the only thing i can agree with you is that you should play it

I think the dev is doing a good job of explaining what the hell is going on
JERMA THE RING WAS ON THE CAR LUL

the problem is that he's playing as a duck
Why does the shpee in the closet sound like someone is in a dress
you should get a 9 year old to play this game
@Jerma985 you're supposed to have a high IQ

the food is a joke, it's a joke
is this the streamer that was on the cover of his own magazine?
@Jerma985 if you die, you die in real life
its almost like the first part of the game isnt even a good joke
I thought the game was about a man with a head, but it's actually about a girl.

jermaPluto i wish i could have the attention span to make a joke like that

I love how this guy just makes the most of everything he does
I love the way you say "I'm going to play"
@Jerma985 you need to turn the mic off for more voices
you can't play the game as it is
you have to do the final boss and not the last one
@Jerma985 There's a bug that makes your voice low pitched
Jerma should just turn on the cam and play a different game
@Jerma985 it's just a bunch of people in chat
you need to pay the taxes to be a mod
Jerma I'm going to go to bed, please wake me up at 3AM.
@Jerma985 You should make a clip of the first one that was played
This is a Jerma stream you are not supposed to do this

@Jerma985 theres a bug in the door that makes the sound
is this the streamer that killed himself LIVE on STREAM?
@Jerma985 do you have the key to the storage locker?
It's almost like you're pretending to be bad at the game

@Jerma985
====================
Oneguy's rule is to only post links that aren't spam.

@Jerma985 You can pick up the shuriken, you can't shoot it
@Jerma985 you need to do a couple of quests to get the keys

you need to do the boss fight with the mage @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You need to find a way to put the saddle on
jermaHeart you are the only one who knows how to play this game

This is the kind of game that will make you a millionaire
Jerma, I've been watching you since my high school days, you sound pretty good.
@Jerma985 Use the coin on the screen to unlock the secret room
@Jerma985 the game is rigged to make you lose money
I think you should put on the japanese voice so it sounds like you're saying "Wally" instead of "Boomer"
I'm going to buy a gamecube and play it on a loop
Jerma can you turn off the game music please
I think this is a bad joke LUL
no one is asking you to do this
@Jerma985 I'm going to fucking go get coffee now
@Jerma985 you can now click on the mag in the inventory
@Jerma985 try to be as calm as possible

@Jerma985 I have a friend who uses the fire extinguisher. It was really fun
@Jerma985 You need to get the first door before the boss.
@Jerma985 This is like the little girl from Sonic
@Jerma985 You have to turn off the game music
@Jerma985 Please do a live stream of the stream for the next 6 hours.
@Jerma985 That's why you have to use the other one

its not a bad game but you cant beat it
the final boss is pretty good if you just keep going
@Jerma985 You have to do the mission more times
"I'm gonna be right back, and I'm gonna be right back"
@Jerma985 it's a porn game, not a game jermaDisgust
If you don't like it, you can't get it
jerma you've been playing for 5 hours, you have to do the DLC
@Jerma985 you can use a drill to remove the pulley

@Jerma985 You have to save a bunch of trees
I don't think you can get past the first part of the game
@Jerma985 it's not a joke, you're just not going to get through the first part
I bet you'd have to just sit on the shelf and drink a gallon of water
I feel like this is a really good stream, it's very well done
@Jerma985 You need to be a good person to be a good person
I'm a terrible person and i hate you jermaPluto

how is he still doing this, what the hell happened
Jerma you have to beat the game to unlock the secret boss
@Jerma985 you are the first person to ever play this game
that was the worst joke I have ever seen
I can't believe Jerma is actually playing a children's game
Did you hear that you need to take off your shoes
you dont need to be a good person to be a good person
@Jerma985 if you're not a good person, don't be a bad person
this is the first time i've heard that word
why are you the size of a human
@Jerma985 did you just walk into the sewer?
jerma is going to get bored of this game and not play it again

JERMA CAN YOU SAVE YOUR LIFE, I NEED YOU
@Jerma985 you have to play through the entire game
@Jerma985 I think you need to use the phone and not the other way around

@Jerma985 You're gonna get this one in the next episode
How do you get so mad at a game you love
I can't believe you lied about the fucking dark souls 2 secret boss

Jerma's gonna have to play a different game
@Jerma985 you have to walk up a certain way
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
This is the most frustrating thing I have ever seen
@Jerma985 did you know that you can't walk on water with your hands?
@Jerma985 This is the only time I've seen you try to read chat in this stream, i swear to god
is that the wii sports car you drive?

he's gonna get hit by a car he can't stop
@Jerma985 The thing is it's a baby and you're the adult

@Jerma985 how long is the stream today?

If you see a light in the bottom left you can't hit it
@Jerma985 Can you do the walkthrough of this game?
I've never seen a game this good, that looks so weird
I think the player has to do it first

You're the one who put a pinata on your ass
@Jerma985 You need to take your own body out of the bag
@Jerma985 You can't just throw it into the water

@Jerma985 We love you, but the one you play is a pain to watch.
@Jerma985 I think you should play a different game
Theres no way you can do this to me jerma

@Jerma985 you can't stop a rat, they're not you
Jerma you need to get a grenade to get a grenade
Why does the camera just get bigger every time you walk?
I think the ones in the bottom right are the ones with the least money
I would rather have Jerma live in a small room than watch me jermaPluto
@Jerma985 the key to the game is to have fun with your audience and not be entertained by the game
jermaPluto its my birthday today. Cake and ice cream is on its way jermaHeart
@Jerma985 you can stop the jump attack now :)
this is just the weirdest thing I've ever seen

@Jerma985 make a wall around the room and then put it in your mouth
you should be able to say "I'm not doing this"
@Jerma985 The "NotLikeThis" guy has been calling you out for like 30 minutes
@Jerma985 It's actually pretty hard to do this

Jerma, it's a stream, he's not streaming today :(
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the new katamari?
@Jerma985 There are no enemies on the world map
Oh man you need to do a bit more
I'm gonna be honest, I don't like this game. I like the more modern version of this game.
he's gonna have to turn on the webcam
@Jerma985 you can tell you're watching a movie on the vpn
@Jerma985 You got a huge target on your back
i think theres a lot of youtubers that don't even have a twitch account jermaIQ
@Jerma985 you're not even supposed to do this
@Jerma985 that guy is going to get killed by the ant
i think its a good idea for a fake stream
i cant believe this is the same guy who beat pinwheel on stream
jermaDisgust @Jerma985 You still have a bunch of people in your house
@Jerma985 did you ever try the xbox gamecube controller?
@Jerma985 don't forget to watch the rest of the stream!
@Jerma985 I'm new here, is this the streamer who beat pinwheel ON STREAM?
@Jerma985 you have to use the phone to get there
You have to do the cool thing again
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 You can't just walk through the door, it's not like there's a door
@Jerma985 I had to go to the bathroom and you still didn’t read it
i dont know what a good pizza is
@Jerma985 You have to do a lot of work to get the other end
what if we kissed in the jerma house
Jerma's gonna do a 2 hour slow mode of this stream
@Jerma985 Jerma is an anime streamer. He is a serial killer.
this is the end of the stream for jerma
I don't know what to think about this
I just got here. Is this the streamer who beat pinwheel ON STREAM?
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -20. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 How long has this stream been going?
@Jerma985 you need to move the camera farther away from the camera
dude I just got here, is this the streamer who beat pinwheel ON STREAM?
@Jerma985 you're supposed to be in the bathroom
you guys think jerma would be able to do this?
@Jerma985 Why is this so easy to beat
@Jerma985 How long have you been playing this game?
You can buy them at the gas station
@Jerma985 YOU DIDN'T USE THE HANDS ON YOUR BODY
YOU CAN TAKE THE BUCKS OUT OF THE CAR
i mean, you can't just say that you were just pretending
@Jerma985 If you were to eat the body of a murderer
jermaWalk GIVE ME YOUR WINKS AND I'LL TAKE MY CRACK jermaWalk
@Jerma985 I was gone for a few minutes. I can't hear the game anymore
@Jerma985 You need to turn off the game and turn off the music
@Jerma985 You'll need to go to the shop, that's where the burglar went.
he's gonna go to the doctor for that
@Jerma985 Please move to the left side of the screen
@Jerma985 You can't hide a fake stream, you're the streamer
I'm going to go out and have a good time
@Jerma985 The old man is the real killer
I've got it just in the mail, you can get it if you get it on your next date.
LUL that's the worst part of the game
@Jerma985 How do you think the game is playing
@Jerma985 I like the way you're telling this to me
@Jerma985 It's not a joke, you're a human being
jermaChomp HEY CHAT, YOU CAN GIVE ME A SHIRT
I'm sorry I didn
====================
The Black Knight is just a pretty good mod for the game
the game is rigged and you can't do it
jermaOld I can't believe you killed that guy
@Jerma985 You need to be in the first phase of the game
@Jerma985 that's not how you pronounce it LUL
@Jerma985 you can do this to us :)
S P A P O N E R
@Jerma985 you can get a free pumpkin for each of the three
@Jerma985 Put the ring on the table and see what happens
there's a lot of stuff you can do to him
why does this game sound like it's in the future
jerma is a boomer, he doesnt understand the concept of time travel
@Jerma985 remember when you said you were going to play the game?
youre gonna get so much money from that
@Jerma985 You've seen my level, you have to finish it
@Jerma985 please do the ai voice please
the game has no good ending to this
I'm gonna have to go to work right now :)
@Jerma985 I have been doing this for the past 6 hours
i am going to have to go to sleep
@Jerma985 you are the best streamer on twitch
Jerma would you ever play a VR game?
@Jerma985 You should play this as a private island
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you go to the bathroom
you're going to get a good spot on the minimap
I don't think you can get better than this
@Jerma985 What if you had to play with the earbuds in?
@Jerma985 you should get a new one that is just the same thing
I think he was just playing with the audio, it's not soundboard
This is just a bad gta game LUL
Jerma, do you have a plan on what to do?
@Jerma985 You can only make your own money with your own money
I just want to see him cry PepeHands
Jerma can you start a new game, I need to sleep
@Jerma985 turn on the cam and pretend you're playing
@Jerma985 This game is the best one, give it a go
This is the most unoriginal game ever made.
Jerma please make a wall around the house so that the people can't come in
@Jerma985 do you think you'll ever play a game on stream?
I think this is the most non-jerma game he's ever played.
im gonna go to sleep now is jerma a good boy
I just ate my egg and now I feel like it's getting cold
@Jerma985 You're gonna get an A in the title
you know they're not going to give you money
if you put your foot on it you can do it
I think you're still playing the game LUL
It's okay Jerma, you're still alive. We love you
i can't believe jerma is playing a game he doesn't know how to play
How many points do I need to donate to make you wink?
@Jerma985 What do you mean, the whole game is a bunch of boring ass games
@Jerma985 get the ring in the casino please :)
he can't see the bottom left of the screen
Jerma is a little too grounded in his own story to be an old man
@Jerma985 If youre reading this, youre in a coma. We know you're not going to be happy
@Jerma985 Hey, is this the streamer who got himself shot?
@Jerma985 You need to raise your pet rat
This is the best part of this game
@Jerma985 Put the grenade in the fire extinguisher
@Jerma985 Do a very basic level in the first chapter
@Jerma985 turn the light on and off it
@Jerma985 You can use the Bumpkin to make a bumpkin.
it's gonna take you to the first level
I like how Jerma is really mad that he's not dead
@Jerma985 can you put on the blingo theme please?
@Jerma985 The key is just to go back to the first part
jerma you are literally just the boss of this game
I bet this game is just a shitty clone of the tf2 tf2 battlefront
I'm actually really happy you're playing this, I really want to see the dev team make a sequel to it
I would be so happy if Jerma would come out of his hole and scream "SELFISH"
LUL that's what happens when you're not watching the stream
@Jerma985 you can put the rod on the table
Just eat a whole bowl of mayo and go to sleep

====================
at least it was good for your health
if you're a fish that gets trapped in the ocean, don't touch the fish
If you don't stream on the 1st stream, it'll be a 24 hour stream
@Jerma985 how long has it been since you streamed something you liked before?
I'm gonna shit on the floor when he starts
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO FIND THE SIDE OF THE CAR
@Jerma985 I'M GOING TO DIE OF EARS IF YOU DON'T STREAM
@Jerma985 Can you move the camera so it looks like you're sitting in the chair?
@Jerma985 theres a button to get rid of the camera
YOU NEED TO WATCH THE TOP LEFT OF THE ZONE
this is gonna be a good stream jerma jermaHeart
@Jerma985 its the same dude from the first game
is this the streamer that beat the first level of the simpsons hit and run on stream?
@Jerma985 I'm here to help with the game, you can't see me without a helmet
you cant even get the candy out of the hat
chat has fallen into the trap of asking a question and not understanding the answer
I'm so happy I'm able to watch this stream :)
Jerma is a psycho, he does that to us all
i think you need to take off your headset
If you were a real person you would have gone for the head
@Jerma985 you are the only person I have ever heard that said you were funny
@Jerma985 Please do the other half of the mission
He's gonna take a break and come back.
I'm just glad to be here, I'm glad to be part of this community :)
This is the worst place to be in a game
@Jerma985 You can only get 1 ticket to a wedding
i just got here, why are you so mad
He's actually doing the part with the facecam LUL
@Jerma985 You can just put a sledgehammer in the middle of it, like a hammer
I can't wait to see Jerma get all the money he needs
If you don't watch the stream, I'll be angry.
@Jerma985 How do you feel about the choice to stream in 2019?
@Jerma985 Put a lid on your house so you can't touch it
you can't put a facecam on a whole game
Jerma can you please stop pretending to be funny? I know that it's not funny.
how do you beat a boss without your balls
@Jerma985 Jerma, the xbox is a fake, you can't play this
@Jerma985 theres a secret level in the side menu
the sun was the only thing keeping you alive
You look like you're in a porno video
@Jerma985 if you dont win you can't do the game
@Jerma985 Can we just get a cup of coffee?
I was just wondering if you could make a vod?
@Jerma985 you can get an alt to stop jerma from saying the same thing over and over again
its not that the game is bad, its just that there are not enough times to not get it right
I have no idea what to make of this stream
I think you need to go into the storage to get the key
@Jerma985 You're a little too quiet now, Jeremy.
Why is the facecam so small? Are you lying
the only person I've heard call you "unfucking dick"
why does this game have so many of the same stuff
@Jerma985 It's the very first mission in the game
@Jerma985 What do you think you're doing wrong?
if youre playing a game like this it's a pain in the ass
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
if you were a fish, you would have gotten the carnival
@Jerma985 i think you can't get a quest for a key
@Jerma985 You don't need to beat the game, just play it first
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, i'd love to see you play Stinky's
@Jerma985 you can't get the secret again, it's too easy
That's a really good idea. We need to do more research on this
@Jerma985 i have to go to work in 2 hours
its not a good idea to have a car on the road
@Jerma985 this is how you die in a video game
@Jerma985 this is a sad movie, you have to stop now
@Jerma985 You need to do a real quick level to unlock the secret
i hate jerma because he pretends to be funny
You gotta be a scientist to be able to do this

====================

S A V E R I O N G
i cant believe he's playing this on a gamecube
@Jerma985 you could have just ignored the whole thing
THE ZOMBIES ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIGHT THEM
I just realized that the music is for the bonfires
we are all doomed, we all have to die
@Jerma985 Go to the bathroom and tell me what to do
can you imagine if you ate a whole banana and just ate it in your mouth
@Jerma985 you should do a tutorial level to learn how to make a bread
I can't believe I'm watching Jerma on my phone and I can't hear the stream
@Jerma985 you cant just put the dvd with you in
we're getting a new Jerma stream jermaVenus jermaVenus
I love how the guy in the bottom right is just the big cow
i wish i could do this with my hands
@Jerma985 if you could send me a clip, what would it be?
the first one is really good if you have a ton of time
@Jerma985 you can only get in from the first one
@Jerma985 i have no idea what is going on but i just know that you are the leader of this jerma
@Jerma985 You should do a Sonic Adventure 2 one
jermaOneguy I have no idea what this is
@Jerma985 you should do a "how to do this" level for each character
I don't think he knows what a horse is
he's gonna be in the second one so he has to go through the first one
@Jerma985 You know you should do the bottom one
jerma I just got here is this game not working
LUL he is going to say that
@Jerma985 If you're not a pleb, you're a boomer
Why are you talking about a water source?
you could have a alex jones voice for this
he's gonna call the police when he gets the sound
I cant believe jerma is so bad at this game
@Jerma985 how did you get this game so far
@Jerma985 You can use the breath thing on the top shelf
@Jerma985 This is the first time you've played this game, it's fucking hilarious
i am so happy that we are getting a new Jerma stream
jerma is going to be in the next jerma rumble
You need to make sure to put the clown car in the clown car
i think the gun is just a fucking gun
JERMA YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME
the one in the middle is gonna get a free one
@Jerma985 It's a good game, but you'll never play it
@Jerma985 Why is the second level a locked door?
there are still people in the basement :)
@Jerma985 You have to buy a new vive
Jerma why do you still have the door locked?
Jerma is a real big fan of the new avengers
I'll have to send you a message to try to make it seem like you're being serious
@Jerma985 PLEASE HEAR MY NAME, HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS GAME
@Jerma985 You're playing the whole game, it's just that you have to be in a certain area and can't do anything without help
@Jerma985 I think you need to do a lot of ground drops
if you lose a bet, it'll be worth it
you know what? I'm not gonna be able to watch it
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this?
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm never going to watch the stream.
@Jerma985 are you going to play the game again?
@Jerma985 you can't just turn off the stream if it's on the backburner
i dont think this is gonna be a good stream jermaPluto
I just realized that the music is for the bonfires
this is like watching a toddler play in the yard
@Jerma985 Just use the disc in the menu
@Jerma985 there's a water source on the left of the car
I thought you were playing a game about the cover art?
This is the best game I've played
this is the first time that has happened
i think the joke was that he would say the words
@Jerma985 can you play the game again please?
I don't know if this is a joke or if it's just him being horny
dont you have to get the second one first?
@Jerma985 You need to make a side bar for the eyes
@Jerma985 It's a man with a beard, he'll get it eventually.
You need to be able to hear the music in the background
The doctors told me
====================
jermaOld What do you think of the world?
@Jerma985 What is your opinion on the rats and how does it feel to be a human?
@Jerma985 So you've been playing this for 2 hours and you're still playing this?
@Jerma985 what if i told you that you'd be a frog and you'd be a pumpkin?
@Jerma985 It's like a baby, just a baby
i just realized that a mod for the gamecube controller is being used on stream
@Jerma985 I'm getting old, why is your hair so messy
@Jerma985 you need to grind the bonfire to unlock the secret
@Jerma985 you can use it to get a quick kill
He was going to say he was gonna play the game tomorrow
@Jerma985 do you not know how to use a hammer?
"what are you doing" "I'm just listening to a random streamer"
Jerma we are in a dream, you are in the room right now
@Jerma985 Do you think that the people in the universe are sentient?
@Jerma985 you can't get past the first part
@Jerma985 YOU'RE IN A CHUNKY VAPE RACE RIGHT NOW
@Jerma985 What is your opinion on the F4M4 Pro Controller?
this is my first time seeing this game. i just got here
do you think we can watch jerma play this game
This is the worst stream of the year
It's like they're trying to make him stop playing
@Jerma985 You need to make a whole house
this is the part of the game where you get the next car
@Jerma985 why are you being so loud at this point
@Jerma985 You can't go back to the start without turning off the lights.
@Jerma985 i think you need to switch to a different game
@Jerma985 please dont read it, its like you're trying to do a backflip and you're not
You have to do the "I want to go back" bit
@Jerma985 YOU CAN DO THE STREAM AT A SLOW RANGE
@Jerma985 you have to get to the top first
@Jerma985 have you ever heard of the awesome owo?
@Jerma985 do you have a username or is it just me?
I just got here, what the fuck is this
"If you don't want to go to jail, you're a coward"
@Jerma985 the game is giving you an easy hit on your feet
"I don't know how to play games" - jerma985
I was gone for a few minutes. What's going on?
I want to watch the stream but it's not fun
@Jerma985 can you do the other two as well?
I think you should have gotten the boots
I don't think you can do it @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You can only play this if you can find a way to make a new character
@Jerma985 how do you think they get in
why are you so excited about this, why are you so excited about this
I can't believe Jerma's playing the Dark Souls of games, what a maniac
@Jerma985 you can upgrade your weapon by killing the boss
@Jerma985 I'm so sorry, you didn't get the joke.
@Jerma985 Why are you doing this to yourself?
@Jerma985 this is like if you're a kid and you have a puzzle but you never play it
@Jerma985 JERMA YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THE CHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE CHAT
@Jerma985 You need to do a backflip with the car
JERMA PLAY MORE DR3 I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE FUNNY
chat we're not just a bunch of idiots who hate it
i can't believe jerma is a terrorist, what a douche
Jerma the next stream is going to be in a week.
@Jerma985 why do you sound like a boomer
i think you can't say it's a porn game
@Jerma985 You have to kill the fish
I just got here, what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 What is the problem with the face?
I don't know if you should watch the stream or not
@Jerma985 you should play a game where you have to pee
@Jerma985 can you please do a webcam stream?
@Jerma985 You need to do a backflip before the next stream
how do i turn off the camera for jerma
jerma is gonna do this joke for 10 hours
It's like you're playing a game and not even the game
imagine if
====================
I'm gonna have to go to work. I just got here.
I'm going to get an ad on my desktop, I'm sure it'll be great
@Jerma985 You can't just put your mouth into a bowl
@Jerma985 you can shoot the building and not take damage
why are you playing this game when you already have a nice house
hey guys can you stop spamming I'm having trouble typing :)
I cant believe jerma is still on this level
Jerma you should play the 3rd one @Jerma985
why do you think jerma plays this game?
I wish I had a business card that would show me what I paid
the only way to get past the battle is to come back and fight
You'll have to get your own version of the sex
@Jerma985 Can you give me a job? I'm trying to raise my child :)
@Jerma985 did you ever do the movie with ster?
I don't think you can eat a shoe
@Jerma985 What if you can't get past the first level?
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game, it's a fucking HORRIBLE game
@Jerma985 I just got here, what is this game about?
@Jerma985 you're supposed to shoot the barrels and not the buildings
@Jerma985 I think that's a good idea for the next level, if you don't get to the other two, you'll be out of luck
@Jerma985 play a song about the dog and its adventures
Dude, you should have gone to the side of the car to get the rest of the money
@Jerma985 The water is still on the roof, it's just in the background
Jerma has a bad taste in things
@Jerma985 you can see the post from the past
@Jerma985 Do you not know how to play this game?
@Jerma985 you have to look for the treasure
it's like you just have an unlimited amount of money
Boomer has no idea what a megaman is
@Jerma985 The first one has a picture of a kid
@Jerma985 Is there a special way to get in?
is this the streamer that made a bad joke?
I like this, I'm gonna buy it
I'm gonna miss the stream in a week
@Jerma985 If you don't get a joke out of it, you can't even get to the end
@Jerma985 Why did you go back to the first level?
You get to play as a hero with the little guys
I think it's a stream joke for a reason
this is like if you put a bunch of candy in a watermelon
i want to see jerma do the greenscreen
@Jerma985 play the only good anime game on twitch
@Jerma985 Play it on the GBA version, it's a real shame that the game doesn't support it
This is literally just a kid playing with a toy gun
@Jerma985 What happened to the first time you ate a shoe?
@Jerma985 do you need a piece of meat?
the mantis is in the closet jermaPluto jermaPluto
"It's not that big a deal" - Jerma985
@Jerma985 do you have a picture of your boomer face on your phone?
@Jerma985 the funny man has to be a BOPPIN
I'm going to be honest, I'm really excited for this stream
@Jerma985 go to the water and press the button
He doesn't have a weapon that can shoot, that's why he's not a boomer
I think this is why he didn't do the tutorial
I'm playing the game I know it's fun
You can put on the mask to go to the bathroom
if jerma doesnt start the stream right now I'm gonna lose my mind
@Jerma985 You need to find a way to stop the stream
@Jerma985 Do you have the steam key to start the stream?
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play the full game?
@Jerma985 This is how the inside of the house looks
@Jerma985 why are you doing this to yourself
I would never get a job in this game
@Jerma985 I think you should make your own mod for the game.
Why is your voice so quiet? Do you still have a girlfriend?
@Jerma985 I love how you say "You're the only person i watch"
I think this is why it takes so long to get into the game
@Jerma985 you can only get a couple of levels
The only thing I hate about this game is the "sheep" part
JERMA IS GOING TO GO OFF THE LINE
this game is really good
====================
One guy that gets 30k a month LUL
@Jerma985 there is a bullet in the car you have to take it
I don't think I've ever seen this game before
@Jerma985 You can press F2 to use the scope
the big fuck you guy is a big FUCK
Jerma, if you can't beat a level, you can't beat the game
why are you making this chat? It's just your voice
the game is too hard for you jerma
@Jerma985 Will you be playing Days Gone or Days Gone 2?
just look up the streamer that did it @Jerma985
i can't believe you did this to me LUL
how do you not know that the whole game is a dream?
just open the door to the elevator and die
so is this the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 We have to kill the monster or we can't go home
You can only get a lower level in this game
@Jerma985 go to the closet, not the closet
i mean we're not going to get to see the new character
@Jerma985 is the worst part of the game?
is this the streamer that beat the first game?
we need to get the nazism out of this
"I'm gonna take a shower, guys" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 I think you have to go to the top right.
@Jerma985 Play the manual version of this game
@Jerma985 You should turn the light on in the game
@Jerma985 YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU DREW CREW
"I just wanna do my own shit" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 if you read this, you will be a boomer jermaOld

the only time i've ever heard that is the "You're the guy" one
jerma, i just got a new shirt :)
@Jerma985 You can use your other hand to grab the weapon
it's a bit like a midlife crisis
This is gonna be the worst stream of 2020
is this the streamer who beat dark souls 3 ON STREAM?
I can't believe Jerma is going to give a fucking SHIT
@Jerma985 your microphone is getting out of sync
@Jerma985 You should make an actual save so you can go back and get a gold star
I can't believe I'm in a room with this guy
@Jerma985 When is the next Simpsons Hit and Run stream?
I'm sorry to hear that, it's not true
@Jerma985 Your one line has been censored, it's not a lie
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THE GIANT RAT
you're going to get a hard time if you don't do it
@Jerma985 I don't think you need to make the new one.
DUDE THEY ARE IN THE BATHROOMS THAT ARE TRYING TO STREAM
you need to wait until the first level to do a move
@Jerma985 how does it feel to be a boomer?
@Jerma985 you have to get rid of the crack
@Jerma985 you can't get rid of the crack
i just got here, what the fuck is this
jermaOld I'm not a fucking idiot, I'm a boomer
I bet the sound of the boulder hitting the wall will be so good
YOURE IN A VIDEO GAME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
It's like a giant gorilla and you're in a zombie apocalypse
@Jerma985 Jerma, you gotta check the cave to find the items
jerma is gonna be so happy when he finds the new face
@Jerma985 You can't use your other hand to grab the weapon
You have to put the same amount of coins into the same column as you do the other way
@Jerma985 You should do a stream with the japanese voices
@Jerma985 that was an anagram for the puke
@Jerma985 you can just go back to the cave
@Jerma985 This game is actually pretty good
i cant believe i missed the vod jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You have to kill the boss first
@Jerma985 i know you're a boomer, but you have been playing this for like 5 hours
@Jerma985 You have to play a game for the whole stream
what do you mean it's the same game over and over
@Jerma985 you have to pay for the gambling ring
i dont think i would like this game if it wasnt for the long time i have to go to the dentist
I can't wait for the first half of the stream

====================
It's okay, I don't know if you're ready for it
I didn't even know the stream was live
how can you have this much fun when you have 3G
@Jerma985 You can't just just run out of time
I like how the game doesnt even give you a choice
I mean, it's the best way to get money
@Jerma985 I just got back, can you restart the game?
@Jerma985 what did you think of the new earth?
@Jerma985 will you be streaming the new ds3 trailer?
I think you need to check out the next boss
@Jerma985 When you use a fish to clean a toilet
that's the only thing i know about the game
I got a bug in my neck and i have to give it a try
JERMA YOU CAN'T MOVE THE MACHINE, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
@Jerma985 You're gonna get addicted to this game
I'm still waiting for the movie that just came out
jerma you have to do a stream with your wife
Jerma it's not that hard to learn to play a game, it's just not that easy to get
i have a feeling that this is going to be an actual good stream
i like how he just looks at the game for a second and says "i cant"
no more heroes 2 is the best
jerma you have to take a photo every time
@Jerma985 is that the guy that did the "Get the hell out of here" joke?
Jerma's going to do a joke where he plays a video game and we all do it
@Jerma985 you have to beat it on stream
I'm gonna see you guys in like 3 hours
YOU CAN USE THE GEM IN THE VILLAGE
He said it was a "bunch of dead"
Bruh I can't believe Jerma is playing this game

====================
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO USE THE MOUSE TO MESS UP
Jerma is a monster hunter, he has a shotgun
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the hell happened to the stream?
jerma is like a detective, he is the guy who comes to your house and goes "I can't get out of the basement"
we're gonna have to pay for all this shit
I got the first one. It's the same voice actor as the guy in the movie
i didnt even know you were streaming it
I just got here, what the hell is this
you need to spend a lot of money on them
@Jerma985 do you think you'll ever play a real game?
@Jerma985 you need to kill the boss first
@Jerma985 You need to go to the top of the stairs
@Jerma985 You can get the nachos off of a chair
that's what they call a con-man, they're actually the ones who make it
@Jerma985 The one you are just the first person to pick
This is the worst thing I have ever seen
YOU SHOULD DO A SPEEDBAR, I THINK IT'S A MORTAL
@Jerma985 I think you can do it, I think it's too hard.
I just came back from the stream what the fuck happened
Hey Jerma, are you going to play the whole game?
I want you to eat a shoe with me
@Jerma985 how many of the three are you in chat?
@Jerma985 you've got to shoot the spider so you can get closer
This is the worst stream I have ever watched.
I hope you have a good time with your kids :)
I hope Jerma gets to the ending of the game
i feel like the "i'll do it" joke is a big red flag
@Jerma985 you should do a VOD of this stream :)
Jerma is literally the only person that has actually played this game, I'm sure he is the only one who actually knows what the game is
I think it's just a weird case of the human body
jermaPluto i'm so happy he didn't stream today
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the -2 joke
@Jerma985 You have to pick the boss first, it's not even a boss fight.
@Jerma985 you need to make the man at the bottom
@Jerma985 you can see your hand and it looks like you're holding the controller
I think you can do it Jerma. Take care of yourself.
@Jerma985 can you do the short man voice for me?
oh I'm just wondering why the water is cold
its really cute how the game is called this
I thought the game was really fun until you started beating it up
@Jerma985 do you ever think you should get a better PC?
@Jerma985 when you die you have to get a new one
i have no idea what's going on but i know this is the game
Jerma is going to be so angry he will actually start the stream
Jerma the game is rigged, you need to stop the stream
you're in the house you can't escape
jerma if you don't do it, I will never get back to you
@Jerma985 you can get the other 10 guys
@Jerma985 I think you need to get the monkey out of the way
SourPls HE DIDN'T USE THE LABO IT'S NOT THE SAME
Jerma I'm so sorry but this is a lot of work. Please get the boots.
why does the only streamer that is not jermaOneguy have the lowest IQ
@Jerma985 you can get the boots for free
jerma has the lowest IQ i have ever heard
I think it's because of the physics. It's not that big of a deal
@Jerma985 You got to make a circle and a circle
Jerma is the worst streamer on twitch FeelsBadMan
How much longer is he gonna be streaming?
The only thing I've noticed about this game is the music
@Jerma985 Why does the boss look like a dinosaur
i cant believe you made it this far
@Jerma985 if you kill the boss, you get the boots.
i hate this game and i hate this game jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you have to get the boots first
I can't believe Jerma has finally lost his mind
oh my god why did you make that face
You're just a person in a time machine
@Jerma985 you can't get rid of the sticks
@Jerma985 did you see that you have a sub?
I don't know if you're aware of the other mods
====================
Do you think you'll play TF2 on stream?
I'm still waiting for the stream to start
jerma will never play mario maker again :(
this is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
HEY JERMA WHERE IS THE PAPERCLIPS FOR THIS?
this is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
I think this is the best level of this game
what if he was in the room with the snake?
I just saw a huge spider in the corner
@Jerma985 I'm still waiting for the stream to start
I'm sorry but this isn't a good idea for your stream.
What if Jerma just keeps playing this game?
I was going to get a hotdog for christmas
i cant believe jerma is dead jermaPluto
@Jerma985 I think the new gamecube controller is better
@Jerma985 you can do the rest of this game
@Jerma985 you can make a really elaborate joke and it will be funny
I'm going to eat a shoe from a shoe store
@Jerma985 you can use the other items as pawns
there is a bunch of stuff in this game that isnt really necessary but it is a good idea
@Jerma985 this is a good stream, I hope you can stay up to date on the streams :)
@Jerma985 you can't do the "RULES ON THE BAND"
I just joined and he's already playing the game LUL
I just got here and jerma is still playing this
He's gonna have to pay for the DLC LUL
SourPls ANYBODY WHO DONATES 500 IS A FUCKKK SourPls
@Jerma985 This is the most polarizing game you have ever played, you have to go to the dentist for it
@Jerma985 you have to do it on the first day
@Jerma985 It's the guy from The Movies who says "I'm not kidding"
@Jerma985 you need to be a little quieter to make the game quieter
@Jerma985 You should do a little bit of the dance floor.
Jerma if you play this game I will cry
@Jerma985 you know the first thing you do is copy whatever the fuck you're doing.
It's the same as the first one, so they're both really bad
@Jerma985 hey man, if you do a fart joke, would you be willing to do it?
we're not gonna let you die, its not your fault
you need to play as much as you can, or you'll lose the game
This is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 you're a big fan of the 2ndjerma channel
@Jerma985 your hands are too close together
@Jerma985 There is a secret boss in this game.
Why does this guy have the exact same voice as Mr. X?
I just got here and i know he's gonna have to restart
Jerma you're just a stupid person, you're not gonna play this game for 2 hours
i like how the game is just jumping around for a while
@Jerma985 Just look up the old youtube vid of you
I thought you were going to make a joke about the french revolution.
i have a vr camera but i cant see it
why does this streamer have a full time job
@Jerma985 There's a place you can go to
@Jerma985 You can go to the main menu and find a random item in the inventory
@Jerma985 What's the last time you played this game?
@Jerma985 please play the muppets theme song again
How the fuck do you get a dog that's a real person
I think it's time to put a facecam on
@Jerma985 You should do a joke where you say "fool" and you have to do it in the same breath for the audience to hear it
why do you have to cut it in half
This is the greatest game of all time
@Jerma985 put the camera directly under the mic so you can tell when he's talking
if you beat this game i will cry
i love this streamer so much. i would love to see more of this
Jerma how many times have you been late?
Just got here and what is this? jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you should play the Mario Maker 2 OST
I remember when it was on PC but the game was on PC
you can't run at night, you can't run at night
@Jerma985 You can use the secret to get money, so they have to pay to get it
I feel like the stream has gone too fast
@Jerma985 why is your mom in the closet?
I
====================
@Jerma985 It's a skeleton, he can't be a human
It's a lot of fun to be a gamer.
you can't do anything with it unless you have a character
@Jerma985 You can buy a new one at the door, but it's broken
you need to use the fire ring on a dead body
@Jerma985 you don't need to put the money in the cards
imagine just using your mouth to speak OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 hey jerma, this is my first time playing in VR :)
@Jerma985 Do you ever go to the bathroom and piss your pants?

I can't believe he is playing this game with his friends

Jerma, you don't have to do this to me.
@Jerma985 why did you put the ring on the stick
Jerma, you're not supposed to have a degree in it

This is the kind of game where you can't even beat it

@Jerma985 I'm a dad and I know it's not very wholesome
i have been watching jerma since the beginning of the stream
What do you think of the Star Wars Battlefront 2 trailers?

That's a huge one, I wonder if it'll ever be done
I'm here to watch the stream and I'm excited to see Jerma do this
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get the boots if you do
i think its because of the end of the game

@Jerma985 is it just me or is it japanese?
@Jerma985 you have to do this to the yellow face
if you get stuck in the wall it's just a fake
i wonder what your reaction would be if you saw that
The best part is that you can do this in the same time as the second boss
I wonder how many people will die from the flu
@Jerma985 Make the facecam bigger to confuse the people

@Jerma985 You need to eat the chicken when you're eating it.
@Jerma985 its like a very happy coincidence that you're doing this
I'm gonna be honest, this is the most entertaining game I've ever seen
"I'm going to get your ass kicked"
it's a fucking shitty game, and it's in a lot of places
@Jerma985 What would happen if you were to die to pinwheel?
i mean you're a kid and you can do it :)
the cow is actually a good friend and they just dont get along
You can’t just say that. It’s like you’re a crazy person
you're literally the only person in the game who can do it
@Jerma985 This is the first part of a "what are you guys doing" stream, it's great!
I really hope the stream isnt just Jerma spamming all the time
I can't believe he was like that in the first place
@Jerma985 You don't have to do anything, just watch the stream
@Jerma985 YOU CAN USE YOUR TASK TO MAKE A WATER WATER PEPPER
You have to put the laptop down to the monitor
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever seen you get this upset
@Jerma985 Why did you lose to pinwheel?
LUL i just want to watch the stream
Jerma you have to have the memory card to get a new one.
Jerma, you need to play the game manual
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH THE BEGINNING JERMA
@Jerma985 What if the next mission is to get the key?
I thought this was a video game, I'm sorry

this game is really bad and i dont want to spoil it
jerma just said you were gonna be in a movie
jermaWalk KEEP GOING IM TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE jermaWalk
i think he just called him out for not using the speed
@Jerma985 You can't stop me from laughing at this joke jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 I like the small amount of space in your face
I can't believe Jerma's been playing this for like 30 minutes
@Jerma985 the new game was a good idea
@Jerma985 this is just like the story of the vroomer
@Jerma985 make a video on how to play the game
@Jerma985 Please try to get the fire extinguisher
@Jerma985 you don't need to put it down
@Jerma985 You'll probably have to wait another day to get a refund
It's a dick move for a game about a man
@Jerma985 you can't save the people who died in the first game, they are dead
I just got here, what the fuck is this
@Jerma985 i just realized your stream is going to be the only stream I watch on twitch
theres a good place to put the toothpicks in
@Jerma985 when are you going to play the game again?
I just got here, what the hell is this
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -26. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
It's like a dentist doing a porno, just like the story
if you get hit by a car, it'll kill you
jermaPop Jerma you need to turn off your headset
I like the idea of a "Go home" emote
@Jerma985 You are literally the only one to put this on the stream
Hey @Jerma985, you can make a custom theme for the stream
i wasnt even here the whole time
@Jerma985 it was the right one, just dont forget the other
I hope you don't do that to me
I just got here and what the hell is this
the house is gonna be like a house with no walls
I just got here, what the hell is this
@Jerma985 You can take a photo
====================
@Jerma985 i need to make a shpee emote
I was in a coma and I can't remember the last time jerma streamed
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2620. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
I just got here, why is Jerma playing an old streamer?
@Jerma985 this is the third time you've said the exact same thing
dont worry, he will never do it again
I just got here, what the hell is this?
@Jerma985 You need to turn off the light in your room
@Jerma985 You can turn off the game audio in the menu bar.
I don't think you'll get to the bottom of this
why did you not tell her that you were playing the game
@Jerma985 You should go back to the first area
Jerma you need to do the new funny meme
I don't want to watch this game, but I want to see the weird world of Minecraft
@Jerma985 "I have no idea what a clown is"
@Jerma985 What do you think of the new pokemon game?
You need to build a bridge over the bridge
@Jerma985 you have to buy the other 3 items
how do you think this game looks if you have no idea what it is
I know i just joined the stream and i just joined
@Jerma985 when are you gonna play fortnite? I have to go to the bathroom
it's really nice to get to know you while you're playing, youre one of the best.
jerma will you be streaming this for a while
no matter how hard you try to make it look nice
@Jerma985 I bet you're gonna have to go back to the beginning of the game to unlock the secret
@Jerma985 you can't just say "hey guys" and everyone will be happy
the only way to get out is to hit the road
@Jerma985 You can't go to the back of the road
I can't believe Jerma is a "streamer" LUL
@Jerma985 this is the worst time to play this game
Jerma, you're gonna be playing this for 8 hours
@Jerma985 The only reason you've been streaming for 8 hours is because you ate a shoe
@Jerma985 can you just get a new one?
That was a giant rat. What's with the giant rat
@Jerma985 Why are you wearing a backpack LUL
jermaPluto why are you always so angry
i have the best of intentions and im not here to do it
@Jerma985 you can jump to the top of the mountains
this is gonna be a lot of work
this is the dark souls of video games
@Jerma985 can we get a rat emote? :)
@Jerma985 Why is your facecam so high?
I like the taste of a fucking lemonade
You should actually buy the game for the first time

he's just going to go to the bathroom and start streaming.
I'm going to be in the backseat with my friends.
@Jerma985 you can't do it without the skill
@Jerma985 The steam is your house and you're not even allowed to go outside
is this the streamer that beat pinwheel on stream?
@Jerma985 You're the only one who's been live for a while.
I can't believe Jerma's got a fucking DIFFICULTY
i can't believe jerma is getting paid by a guy who is a clown
theres a bunch of emotes and links, but they're all worthless
@Jerma985 why did you have to tell us that
You can't even tell me how to write
He's gonna run out of ammo on the way down
@Jerma985 I'm a mod and I need to stop this
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that beat the game on stream?
Jerma is going to be late for work today
we're gonna be watching you all night long :)
I've never been to a bowling alley and I'm getting anxiety from the noise
I want to get my hands on the Jerma985 shirt
@Jerma985 can you turn off the music please?
Jerma, are you going to do a live action spider-man game?
I thought this was a joke joke, just like the vod
@Jerma985 Do you think you have a problem with the audio?
jerma i think you need to get a different one
@Jerma985 can you turn on the noise and make the noise more like "dabs"
I have no idea what a clown is
@Jerma985 Don't you have a hat? I'd be surprised
====================
US military drone strikes in a war zone
its like an old school horror game with a maze
@Jerma985 you gotta get a job and then buy a new car
that guy is the one with the wii remote
i'm sorry that you're still playing this game, but I don't know how to handle this
i hope you get a better one from twitch than this
i'm gonna have to go to work in the morning jermaPluto
@Jerma985 it's not going to work if you're using the wrong audio
chat you're probably just hearing the noise that's coming from the back of your head
you can kill them like they're a real enemy
@Jerma985 "i wanna eat my own ass"
@Jerma985 Do you want to be the next Mr. X?
He's going to take a nap, he's going to have a dream about how he is going to sleep.
you gotta do a lot of stuff to get into the boss room
i dont think you can get rid of it
jermaOld I'm not gonna lie this is a good stream
this is what happens when you put your computer away
I'm going to go buy a new car
jermaChomp I'm gonna have to take a nap.
@Jerma985 you can't just give the creature a million dollars
its a good game but it's not as good as the original
@Jerma985 that was the best part of the stream
@Jerma985 There are 3,000 different endings, so you could be up to a minute ahead
@Jerma985 You need to play it for the first time, it's very fun
SIR YOU WERE A DREAMER AND YOU CANT BEAT THIS
I don't think you should be playing this game
@Jerma985 Why do you still have the bowl cut?
you should play the first game in the series, the first one is gonna be a lot better
@Jerma985 if you had a dog in your house that would be hilarious
@Jerma985 what are you going to do for 4 hours?
Chat can't help but feel like jerma is just really bad at the game
I remember when Jerma would do voice acting for the movies
jermaPluto do you have a 4chan account? :)
I was playing this game for 6 hours and I already felt like shit
Jerma can you just get the three new emotes?
The sun is red and jerma is a madman
@Jerma985 I had a dream you were playing a game called DMC2
@Jerma985 you look like a man of culture
is this the streamer who beat Jevil on stream?
We’re gonna have to get you to do a 10 minute slow mode
@Jerma985 is this what your looking for
@Jerma985 do you have a big head?
how does this even work? why is it so hard to make an end stream
@Jerma985 you can only eat like 10 hamburgers
jerma is like the guy who eats a shoe on stream
@Jerma985 can we get a damn wink?
I'm gonna miss the old jerma, he was the best
@Jerma985 how long has your stream been going for?
I can't believe you forgot to take your water filter
@Jerma985 you can buy a new car with that money

You look like you're in a horror movie
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR EYES TO SEE THE SOUNDS
Jerma, you need to stop this game for real
Jerma is going to die on stream
yeah i was gonna say "jerma is a psycho" but i guess that's a lie LUL
Jerma is too busy talking to himself to read chat

why are they just picking the ones with the gun
@Jerma985 do you have a facecam? do you have the facecam?
@Jerma985 You have to get into the room first
if you die in the game you die in real life
This is like the same level as the first one

Jerma I am so sorry that you are having such trouble with this game
It's the world record for the longest video

I'm so glad I didn't miss out on that gift sub
I’ll take you to the doctor if you need him
Jerma you're a great streamer and I love you too
I don't think he can do it with the right hands
its a good joke to end the stream

@Jerma985 This is the worst fucking game you've ever played
I need to see a doctor now :(
@Jerma985 I just realized you're the only person I watch.

@Jerma985 This is a good game, don't be sad :)
@Jerma985 Do you think you could make a birdhouse level?
@Jerma985 you need to find the one that isn't that big

@Jerma985 Make a bunch of custom emote slots for each

JERMA I NEED TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM

@Jerma985 you need to make a fat streamer joke
i just got back from the grocery store and he's still here
i was watching jerma and he was on his second season of fortnite
do the music in the game for the gamecube
@Jerma985 when are you going to do a house flipper stream
jermaPluto i can't believe he lied about the cup jermaPluto
@Jerma985 it's a good idea to get more than one character, you can't just make a bunch of people into a bunch of characters
i was gonna say that but the guy who made that is fucking hilarious
Jerma, you're a fucking EZ bake. It's not a good thing.
@Jerma985 can you please stop playing this game?
@Jerma985 you can just say "yay" and it'll auto-record when you say "yay"

It's a nice one, and it's not the best
Can you be in the next Jerma Rumble
I'm not a doctor I don't have any fucking experience with it
this is just a more generic version of the gta universe
@Jerma985 Is it just me or is the music slightly different?
@Jerma985 I'm gonna be right back. The monkey is here!
What the fuck is happening, this is a disaster
it's a game you can't play without a story
this is the kind of game you need to have a good time
@Jerma985 i think you need to do a carpenter's stream
you can't stop, you're a bad boy, don't stop
jermaVenus @jerma985 The first thing you hear when you say "I'm going to get a lot of money" is "I'm going to be a lot of money"
The only thing I can say about this game is that it is a bit boring
@Jerma985 no one said anything about this game

It's a new way to play the game
you should do a normal version of the stream
@Jerma985 The actual boss is a bunch of zombies
He's never gonna see you again, remember? LUL
i can't believe jerma is still a virgin
@Jerma985 You can't even hit the door when you're in the car
@Jerma985 You should have a mic with that in the back
can someone explain the "stuck in the middle of the road" thing to me?
@Jerma985 do you think the same kind of stream would be better for you if you were a little shorter?
the only way to fix this is for you to play the game at the speed of light
This is the best part of the game
@Jerma985 What's your opinion on how much of a big dumbass you are?
why is the "tickle her" sound like "tickle"
He needs to get to the parts that are hard
@Jerma985 you just have to pick up the baby
jerma i just joined what happened to you
@Jerma985 there is a way to make it take place in the right place
I am about to go watch a VOD from last night
i wanna go to the store and buy a jerma shirt
Just make sure you have a pet rat in your house
@Jerma985 if you do it again it will be a joke
"i want to have sex with this guy" -Jerma985
I can't believe jerma is still in the game
@Jerma985 You can only play it once if you have the backpack

@Jerma985 You should've just done the tutorial mission
You're the only one I've ever heard of LUL
@Jerma985 You're going to have to do this again
You don't have to die to the boss. Just use the shortcut on the top left
The game was too hard for him, he couldn't afford the gamecube.
@Jerma985 This is the worst bit I’ve ever seen
you guys are gonna be like "we'll make this streamer do this"
what if you didn't know the game was gonna be like this?
@Jerma985 You should add a bunch of other music to the game
@Jerma985 I have to go to bed, can you get me some coffee?
@Jerma985 Why are you making fun of a child?
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 I had a dream about you just fucking died
@Jerma985 You can put a bunch of them in the same place
Dont you just have to run up the stairs
@Jerma985 how much do you think you could have spent on this game

@Jerma985 Are you going to play new Vegas?
jerma can you stop playing this game please
@Jerma985 Can we get some TF2 emotes? :)
@Jerma985 why do you keep saying "dinner"
@Jerma985 There's a lot of good stuff in the game
@Jerma985 Hey guys, how long has this stream been going?
jerma i dont think i've ever seen you as a person
you can make the car in this game
@Jerma985 There's a new bug in the chat
Is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
The guys that do all of the fighting in this game
@Jerma985 you can't just say that you like the game
@Jerma985 you're too smart for this shit, you have to let us know
Jerma's gonna be playing the Viva Pinata DLC tomorrow
It's not too late to get a VR headset
@Jerma985 you're going to have to wait for him to get back to the town
he's going to get mad at you for not killing him
@Jerma985 The main character is a robot
I've never seen this game before, but it looks like it's going to be interesting to watch
i mean this is the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream
this is the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream
jerma can you tell me how much you hate us
@Jerma985 YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS YOU
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, this is the worst joke you've ever made
you need to get an axe to the heart
You have to put some salt in the wound to make it go away
@Jerma985 How much are you paying for this game?
I'm not gonna give you the money, I'll give you the money if you give it to me
@Jerma985 this is just how the character design is
@Jerma985 will you be playing the game tomorrow?
@Jerma985 you should try to do a little bit of work to get the music up
im not joking this game is boring and I dont even think it's fun
@Jerma985 I can't believe you beat dark souls 3 on stream jerma
no you need to get a super hero like Super Mario Bros
@Jerma985 You need to be in the middle of the way
@Jerma985 You have to use the controller to shoot, just don't
JERMA IF YOURE ON THE TRAILER AND YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO RUN THE ROOF
It's not like he's making a video about it
@Jerma985 try to find the boss in the lower left @Jerma985
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 ON STREAM?
@Jerma985 did you know that this is a good game
@Jerma985 you can also just shoot him, but not with a gun
@Jerma985 I'm gonna be honest I'm pretty sure you're gonna have to start the game over
@Jerma985 you can actually get a good weapon if you have a good weapon
@Jerma985 you need to get the other one first
@Jerma985 That was like a third of the way through
@Jerma985 you have to save before you can
====================
I wish the music would stop so I could do the voices
I'm gonna go to the store, I don't want to miss any of the stream
I'm just going to say that the game is good and not bad
@Jerma985 Is it because you're in a porn game?
I love how he just gets on the boat and jumps off the boat and gets shot
I wonder how long you'll be playing this game
This game is giving me a headache. I don't even know what I'm watching

you have to jump over the top of the castle to get the castle
You have to jump to the other side
Hes gonna have to get this ass to work
I swear to god if I was a clown I would probably be a clown
@Jerma985 you are the only person who cares about the game
The game is broken, it's not even a good game
@Jerma985 please make your own music, i cant see the stream at this point
I'm glad the stream is over, I've been here for hours and I can finally catch it
You're not even supposed to do this, you just keep doing it
@Jerma985 you are like a black hole, its not real
You can use the snake's head as a shield
@Jerma985 if you like this game why don't you like the danganronpa video?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 this is the jup you’re in jermaJup3 jermaJup4
Jerma, I want you to play this game with me.
I think you might need to run more than one route
@Jerma985 PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP THIS
@Jerma985 do you think you can put a light on the door?
@Jerma985 your hair is a little too short
@Jerma985 That's why you're so good at this game
@Jerma985 if you say "boots" the stream will end
@Jerma985 when will you be playing the entire game?
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, just got here, what's going on?
i thought the video was a zoomer joke
i wish i had a car with a steering wheel
@Jerma985 you're gonna be in the labo, right?
Jerma, can you play a video game for me?
@Jerma985 this game is a lot of fun
I think it would be a great idea to have a tier list for people that have never played this game
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Sunday. Around 4pm PST!
Jerma, how many times do you have to say you're a fucking idiot to people?
@Jerma985 Play the new King of the Hill
@Jerma985 you have to do the building part
@Jerma985 You can't just cut the hair, you have to cut it in half
@Jerma985 i have a hard time believing that this game is even remotely similar to The Thing
@Jerma985 do you have any plans for a new game?
@Jerma985 please don't tell me you can't do it
Jerma, if you do the the black hole joke again, I'll have to leave the stream for a week
I wonder what the hell Jerma's next stream will be
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -26. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
I thought you were going to play this game
@Jerma985 you have a full time job that's not a job but a living room
@Jerma985 You need to take care of the other rats, then they get shot
@Jerma985 you have to do the labo part
Did you ever play A Grapes of Wrath?
@Jerma985 the fursona is the best part of the game
@Jerma985 what is the last time you ate your own ass?
@Jerma985 What about the more famous death stream?
I think this is the one with the blue guy
i just got here, what the hell is going on
@Jerma985 you need to put a fire extinguisher on your head
@Jerma985 you have to be near the other houses to get the fire extinguisher
@Jerma985 is this the new Dr. Smoixen game?
"Now I'm gonna get mad at you" - Jeremy Elbertson
I've been watching jerma for years, what's this
I was gonna say that but I'm not gonna
this is the best stream I've seen all year
@Jerma985 you have to go through the town before you can get the castle
@Jerma985 I have the xbox, but it isnt working
It was a little too hard for my eyes
why are we still here? we need to take a break
jermaWalk on my way to the club jermaWalk
@Jerma985 when is the next community night?
@Jerma985 put on the facecam, it's pretty cool
I can't believe you were banned for playing this game
SourPls WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING SourPls
@Jerma985 He's gonna do a
====================
Are you planning on playing a more advanced version of this game?
@Jerma985 You have to keep a close eye on the facecam and it makes it look like you're in the room
i can see the people in this game for miles
@Jerma985 They're a guy you can't kill
I feel like he's gonna get bored of this game
I got a sub from you just now :)
@Jerma985 you can't be playing the game on your own time
The whole game is just the one guy
@Jerma985 it's okay Jerma, it's all good
@Jerma985 do you have a good plan to beat this game?
you can't just lie about it if it's already been told
It's like when you're watching an ad on the radio
@Jerma985 I think you can get it on steam now
you should play it on the official Wii app
the game was good but they changed it
This is the most fun stream I've had in a while
no I have a little cat in my room jermaPluto
i wish i could be a robot :)
@Jerma985 try to figure out what the fuck is happening in the game
@Jerma985 Have you tried turning off the lights on your car?
I thought it was a joke, but that was a joke
this is what it feels like to be a baby
HE WAS LITERALLY TAKING OFF THE WATER WutFace
@Jerma985 you should have a webcam with you
You just can't escape this game without going to the exit
There's a lot of guns in this game
@Jerma985 I was wondering if you would ever play a horror game?
Jerma is a smart guy, and he knows how to shoot
what if you're not a good gamer?
@Jerma985 you should have a little hat, it looks nice
theres a little place in the middle of the park that has a giant red circle
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -23. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the two short ones
I think the point of this is to be a new viewer
it was a really good game, but its not a good one
the only real streamer is Jerma985, he doesn't care about us
I think he's just gonna be in the basement
I can't wait for Jerma to start the stream
@Jerma985 you can use your moustache to make a picture of your face
@Jerma985 you're going to get a lot of bad reviews
@Jerma985 you can use the ones you got
@Jerma985 I think you need to put in the water
how many times have you been to a party
i am so happy to be here with you :)
jerma is going to have to play with a controller
@Jerma985 if you didnt know the answer would be to sit down on a stool and eat it, you're too smart
JERMA IF YOU DONT PLAY THIS GAME I WILL SHIT MY PANTS
I just got here, what is this chat meme
@Jerma985 If you say the phrase "You're not a baby" the game will automatically turn off the stream
jerma you're gonna get banned for this LUL
You're not even supposed to be here, just to save up points
this is the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream
this game is really bad, its like a game of thrones
@Jerma985 you're gonna get kicked by the guards
@Jerma985 That's the guy that said "You're not a baby"
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
you have to get the other 2 pieces
@Jerma985 you're gonna get all the traps in the first level
@Jerma985 I think you need to run a continuous loop
@Jerma985 I thought the streams were good, but now I'm convinced it was a fake
@Jerma985 I was in the same room as you and I was like "Are you okay"
@Jerma985 you can't be the streamer who said no.
"I think I'm gonna do it" *pulls out gun*
this is what happens when you're not a boomer
@Jerma985 you should have a way to tell when the stream starts
why is there a black hole in the sky
I want to play this game, but I'm not a boomer :)
this is a great game and you should play it
so that's the one guy, the one guy who will pay you for the game
@Jerma985 you have to stop the game and go to the bathroom
Why is there a head
====================
Pls do you know who I am?
@Jerma985 Why are you using a real PC?
I just got back, what the hell is happening?
he doesn't know how to use the toilet
@Jerma985 You should play a game with the video game mechanic
@Jerma985 I was thinking about it but I was thinking of the game
this is the best stream i have ever seen
you need to go to the right side
Jerma, you're gonna be a mess if you don't have a bag
I was thinking about it, but I was thinking of the game mechanics
The official Jerma Rumble channel is at 3pm
Hey Jerma, would you like to see the stream start?
@Jerma985 you can't get the fucking boots you need to get the other ones
I got a call from the doctor in a month
what's that new emote jerma is gonna do?
@Jerma985 this game is the same as the first one
I'm so glad that you have fun with your new friends
@Jerma985 Can you give us a link to the vod?
@Jerma985 you just spent an hour in the tutorial
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, you're really good at this
I'm gonna be real with you, you can do this
can't wait to watch the stream on my phone
@Jerma985 you have to do the whole thing in one sitting, it's really relaxing
so is this the guy who beat pinwheel on stream?
Jerma, I think you should talk to the creator.
I heard you want to die and that you'll die in 2 hours
@Jerma985 you have to leave, it's a fuckin road.
@Jerma985 what if you're an asshole and you're a meme
@Jerma985 I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to start the stream
@Jerma985 how much does it cost to make that movie?
You are a really smart dude, you should do the job for you
jermaWalk me walking around the carnival with my friends jermaWalk
Oh man, I gotta go to the bathroom.
@Jerma985 You can do a "backflip" in the direction of the laser
I think you need to get a full loadout before you can go to the hospital
You can't be cool with people you don't know
@Jerma985 Do you like this game? Its got a great soundtrack.
@Jerma985 you are literally just a bunch of kids who are fighting for your property
@Jerma985 make a road to get to the other side
you can do this without killing someone
@Jerma985 You just got a drink in the water
@Jerma985 why are you making a house in a desert
YOU CAN CUT TO YOUR EYES TO SEE THE FUCKING FACE
@Jerma985 did you ever play the 2ndjerma stream?
Jerma is going to be late for the stream jermaPluto
this is like a dream come true scene
Jerma is a boomer. He was on the toilet
@Jerma985 you can go back and get the items
@Jerma985 I'm in the toilet, can you clean up the mess?
@Jerma985 do you think your camera is in the other room?
@Jerma985 you have to go to the left after the entrance
jerma should have a bug house on his stream
Can't wait for the 5th episode of Jojo
I wish I could give you the jerma shirt
@Jerma985 your house is so small, it looks like a balloon
jermaWalk I want to be the Jerma. I want to be the Jerma
oh shit is that the nancy drew stream?
I can't wait to see the rest of the stream
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're a pretty good streamer.
the one time you get to watch jerma live
is this the guy who beat pinwheel on stream?
If you go to the right side of the screen, it's in the corner
@Jerma985 you can use the lockpick to open doors, it's on the right side
you can't just kill them with that damn knife
I think it's the same joke that got him banned from the twitch con
you need to be in the shop to get the boots
@Jerma985 you should play the game, it's a fun and interesting game
i just noticed the stream title is "backflip"
my dad would put a block of lids on his back
If you're good at something never do it for free
I'm so sorry but your a gamer. @Jerma985
i'm going to be a mess if you don't have a bag of laundry

====================
This is what happens when you are too fast
"I don't want to be a farmer"
Jerma I think you're having a bad day.
It's like the end of the last episode of The Thing
@Jerma985 I'm actually the one who said that. You've been here for a while and you don't know how to play this game.
I think this is the best game of all time
and he's not going to see it in the next 10 years
@Jerma985 do you not have a youtube account?
this is just an old video of jerma talking about a youtube video
you can't put it on the table, it'll make it hard to see
Jerma, I'm a doctor and I know you don't have to eat the food
I would be happy if you were playing this
@Jerma985 Why are you so obsessed with that part
@Jerma985 Don't forget to check the labo stream!
why does the steam name just come out of nowhere
i feel like its not funny if you read it
@Jerma985 You have to find the cow first
This is the best thing you've done, Jeremy
@Jerma985 It's a real good game, it's very detailed
@Jerma985 Is it a good idea to get more money for this
This is what happens when you are too fast
@Jerma985 You can't make a robot that can't make jump scares
@Jerma985 are you going to play this?
@Jerma985 This is the only time you can get a ball in a game
I just realized you could get a crossbow with a sniper
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 👉 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
@Jerma985 do you think you'll play this on stream?
this is like watching a person die while watching a movie
i hope the guy that gifted me a sub is not a baldcoin
@Jerma985 this is a good game, it's a good game
@Jerma985 if you're gonna use the steam it's gonna be a lot more fun than this
why are you so obsessed with that part
I just got here and he's still playing this?
@Jerma985 you're gonna get a perfect hit on the ball
@Jerma985 You can't play this game until you buy the boots
I'm the guy that sent that message! I'm the guy who recommended this game!
@Jerma985 You can't tell me what you're talking about, I'm just here to tell you the fact that you're a great person :)
do you think the stream will go off?
@Jerma985 I think the sound effects are from the game, not the game
Why is this streamer still playing this game??
This is the best game I've ever seen
this is the guy who made the clown car game LUL
the game is so much better than this
@Jerma985 You gotta go into the other room
if you're bad at something never do it for free
the person who said it is a liar
@Jerma985 You're a fool and you know it
You can't go to the sun because it's in the sky
@Jerma985 what the fuck are you talking about?
@Jerma985 You need to make a large river to go up
He's going to be so pissed that he's never going to finish this level
the new xbox game is literally a 3D level
@Jerma985 The stream has been stuck for an hour
imagine going to the dentist and eating a shoe
@Jerma985 how long have you been doing this?
@Jerma985 You should have spent the first half hour on the tutorial
Jerma can you please sing the theme song for this game?
@Jerma985 can you go to the top of the stairs?
I'm gonna be honest, I'm really happy for you
I'm pretty sure it's a creature with the opposite sex
@Jerma985 do you think you'll play this on stream?
that guy is a chad, what a villain
you have to go to the other side
@Jerma985 Have you tried the new weapon that gives more health
@Jerma985 you have to do a little bit of everything before you do it
"I'm the one who sent that message!"
how long has he been playing this game?
I have never seen this game in my life, it's almost like it's a compilation of a movie.
i cant believe this streamer is late
@Jerma985 please look at the top left corner of the screen, it's literally the only way to get out
@Jerma985 the middle one is a watermark LUL
====================
jermaHeart I love you, and I can't stop farting and screaming jermaHeart
@Jerma985 please turn off the music i need to go to work
I know how to make these sounds, and I can't do it without the music
Chat is getting really annoying now I'm getting a headache
i dont think jerma has the actual knowledge to do that
I just got here what the fuck happened
theres a gummy bear that goes on a ride
how do you think you'll feel when you get to the end
i think it was just a bad joke
what if we kissed at the end of the stream
@Jerma985 It's only about the "you can do it" bit, it's not funny anymore
when is he going to show the boots
jermaPluto I'm sure he's playing some new game on this
@Jerma985 You just added a lot of time to your hair
@Jerma985 YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN EXPLAIN THE POLL
jermaOld jermaOld jermaOld can't even spell winks anymore jermaOld
you can't get too close to the sun
I'm from the future, you're just not a real doctor
@Jerma985 you have to get out of the building first
@Jerma985 What are you doing on your hands
@Jerma985 I think you need to go back and get the books
i like this game more because of the world building and the weird facial animations
@Jerma985 You can still have the weapon if you have it on
You have to go to the little town
jermaOld you could've just stuck to the button
guys, i'm not sure if he's a real gamer
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the first one if you don't get it
I hope this is the last time you see this game
@Jerma985 you can shoot with your hand or with a gun
YOU DONT NEED TO PUT IT IN THE BATH
"I can't afford a car" "I cant afford a car"
I'm so glad you're doing this, I can't wait to see you play this game again
@Jerma985 I think you need to use the water filter
@Jerma985 you can use a wrench to cut the gap
@Jerma985 you can sell it to someone and get a free car
@Jerma985 do you have a picture of yourself?
so that's why the streamer cant afford it
i like this game but i like the idea of people asking for money to play it.
this is the real ending to the video
did he just win the lottery? i thought he had the best chance
I like how you just keep turning around and moving the camera
Jerma, you have to know how to use a hammer
The stream is a lot like the garden stream
Bruh, I'm on the toilet and I'm not going to get out
jermaWalk i have to go to work soon jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you have to buy the right ones first
i love how the game is just making you pay for the shit you're doing
you're the only one that can do this
@Jerma985 Please turn off the music for this one.
HE'S GONNA MAKE HIMSELF HARDER AT THE END
i can't believe jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can only make it to 100
@Jerma985 do a stream of you playing the piano
@Jerma985 You can't use a wrench in the water filter
I wonder if he's going to do another Sekiro stream
This is like the perfect punishment for a bad joke
@Jerma985 Is there a way to save the life of the dog?
@Jerma985 Jerma, you should play this game. I know it's hard.
@Jerma985 You have to be on the floor
i wish the streamer would turn off the music
@Jerma985 You should play the other one, it's like a 2 player game
It's a good idea to put the stove top in the center of the room.
jerma is getting too old for this game
I think you should get a refund for the "You're not old enough" joke
@Jerma985 The coin is a cool coin, but you have to pay for it
this is gonna be a 10 hour stream
what if you don't want to do the joke
jermaWalk B O O M E jermaWalk
@Jerma985 You should play the game that's already out
I'm glad you can do this to me
@Jerma985 YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VIDEO
jermaWalk I'm not gonna be able to watch this
====================
Jerma985 I'm here to tell you that you're not a fucking idiot. I'm just here to tell you that you're not smart.
I don't think you can do this without the other team
@Jerma985 you have to keep the flag on your other team
this is gonna be a fever dream for jerma
@Jerma985 I know you're not the most innovative streamer but I'm proud of you
@Jerma985 you have to get out of the water
I am so fucking scared. I can't stop freaking out
@Jerma985 The other stream is gonna be a Jerma stream
@Jerma985 You need to do the following, but not the regular ones
jerma's stream is live now, he's gonna be late
I'm gonna give you an F for this
this is the only stream where he makes it to the top
@Jerma985 you need to have a heart attack to play this game
Jerma I can hear the game audio in your ear
@Jerma985 YOU CAN PRESS SPACE AND JUMP TO THE LEFT
i like how the music is like a little bit of the rock
@Jerma985 youre probably the only one who knows how to play
You need to collect the energy bar from the machine
@Jerma985 If you're on mobile, use your camera to see the floor
This is just a way to get a good laugh
@Jerma985 You can make the "Toothpick" sound in the game, you can put it in your mouth and then click it.
Why did you have to pay $100 for a game for only 5 bucks?
@Jerma985 You can go back to the other side of the bridge
jermaChomp 📣 YOU CAN PUT THE BELLS IN THE WATER
@Jerma985 You can't just kill a shark on the first turn.
@Jerma985 you can turn off the game music, it's too loud
jerma's going to be late for the carnival
@Jerma985 The sun is real, its just a picture
@Jerma985 so is the new avengers movie coming out?
@Jerma985 This is the most detailed joke of the decade
its gonna be an hour and a half of this
@Jerma985 It's a Christmas special, they had to make the whole thing
@Jerma985 hey jerma, did you know that the audience is actually human
This is gonna be a disaster in the first 10 minutes
@Jerma985 put a bunch of money into your bank account
I'm sorry, I just got here, I just want to let you know that I'm gay :)
This is like when you get a heart attack and your heart attacks are worse than your car overheating
@Jerma985 Please do a new twitch channel jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You need to set the car up so it can't swing
Oh god oh fuck, I can't believe he's fucking dead
Hey guys, I'm back from visiting my boyfriend! jermaPluto
why would a man be in this position?
I think it's good to have a nice, warm, drinkable cup of coffee :)
@Jerma985 this is like a shitty jojo reference
@Jerma985 You have to get to the bottom of the portal first
JERMA ITS THE MOST WEIRD ONE YOU'VE EVER SEEN
is this the guy that beat RE2 on stream?
@Jerma985 You can put the bird in the hole
@Jerma985 I was looking for a jerma clip, please
I can't believe you're playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 I think they are, they are the same people
I feel like that is where the fun starts
this guy is a big fan of the show
@Jerma985 The main character is not a scientist
@Jerma985 if you get to the top, you'll get to the bottom
what if you're going to do the whole movie?
@Jerma985 you can use your imagination to make the game more realistic
@Jerma985 You need to go to the exit of the ship and make the shortcut
JERMA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DAWS
@Jerma985 This is a good idea, I'll be sure to see if I can get it working
@Jerma985 I'm going to the toilet to get some water, thanks for the tip
@Jerma985 I think it's a speedrun but that's a bit of a stretch
You have to get to the other side of the bridge
@Jerma985 You have to do the "I'm a little short" trick, you need to jump up and down to get to the other side of the bridge
@Jerma
====================
THE GAMERS ARE ALIVE, WE ARE BORING
I don't think he's even gonna play the game jermaPluto
i think its like 4 am but i dont think it was 5 am
you can change your own sound card, just not the game
@Jerma985 you can do it with a controller :)
@Jerma985 This is the most horrific shit ever
jermaOld I remember when jerma used to be a kid
I can't believe Jerma is fucking dead jermaPluto
I like the idea of you as a playable character
I would rather that you just do a stunt double and go to the hospital
What the fuck is a 5'7" woman supposed to be
jermaChomp 📣 JERMA PUT ON A RING FOR THIS
He's gonna do another Half Life stream with the voice acting
@Jerma985 I have a cat I can get a cat for you
@Jerma985 The old one was the one with the blue bar
I just got here, what's happening? I missed it
jermaSun I can't believe Jerma's going to fuck himself
that's how it's been for like 10 years
oh no its just a steam controller. you can't get that
imagine being able to have an opinion about a game LUL
I was watching the VOD and Jerma was talking about how theres no way we could be in the future
@Jerma985 did you just say that you are going to kill your own body?
@Jerma985 I'm just waiting for you to play a new game
i think it's just a big bar of soap
@Jerma985 can you turn off the mic please
the drawstrings of my pants just flopped directly into a urinal. Wtf do I even do now? I’ve been walking around like I’m wearing a diaper cause I don’t want them to touch me.
I don't think you should have the day off
jermaWalk THIS IS THE STREAMER, BEGIN THE STREAM jermaWalk
@Jerma985 make sure to get the boots so you can get the boots later
imagine if this was your only activity
@Jerma985 put the 2nd monitor in the closet
I'm glad you're doing the well thought out voice acting
@Jerma985 This is the first time we've seen the monster rancher trailer
@Jerma985 Do you remember the original Donkey Kong Country?
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup
====================
@Jerma985 he's doing the same thing over and over again
@Jerma985 can you get the "I'm in the bathtub" sign?
i had to go to work today and i just got back
why is there a bit of a weird echo in the background
cheer100 jerma you should play the game you want me to play :)
I can't believe Jerma is not a gamer
i cant believe that jerma is streaming right now
I thought you were gonna beat the game
@Jerma985 when are you gonna do the final boss?
@Jerma985 You should have the shield on the third level
jermaOld DansGame no one knows how to pronounce it
jerma if you do a math test on stream it will be super hard to tell which one is real
@Jerma985 i think it might be a slight glitch
theres a lot of people that dont like the new jerma
I can't believe jerma's stream is a shitshow
I think you're the only one that can beat the game
@Jerma985 get a baby corgi for the ring
it's not even an issue, it's just the way the game is
you were supposed to say that, you know it's there
how did you get that far in this game
no one will remember that the two towers were destroyed by the communist revolution
Chat is just a bunch of people with a fetish
@Jerma985 You can turn off the auto click and click again to get the new one
you should just put the water at the bottom of the pool
You are now a part of the family!
@Jerma985 can you take off the shoes so i can sleep?
i remember when the e3 conference was fun
I'm not even in the game anymore PepeHands
He looks like he just took a dump LUL
@Jerma985 You should do a randomizer run for this game
@Jerma985 You need to do a "a run" thing to get the boots, you should do a run for a bit
its ok, i dont care if you are just playing it
imagine being a mom and not just cooking mama
I have to go to work and Jerma's going to stream today
you have to do the whole thing in one try
@Jerma985 do a poll to see how many people will be subbed
@Jerma985 Did you ever get to the point where you lost the stream?
@Jerma985 I'm gonna be real with you, you are the only one I know
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this?
@Jerma985 are you going to do a gamecube stream
the best part of this game is that you can do it
@Jerma985 If you were to die from this, what would you do?
I cant believe you have to do this again
@Jerma985 the chat is just the chat of Jerma's children
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup0 jermaJup1 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0 jermaJup0

Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2708. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
theres not enough to eat in this world
Why would you be doing this to us
He's been playing this for 10 hours straight, you're supposed to kill him
I've never seen jerma before but I've seen him before
I can't believe Jerma is watching this stream live
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF ANYONE
SourPls IN THE BATHROOM SourPls IN THE BATHROOM

@Jerma985 is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this?
I just got here, what the hell is this game?
@Jerma985 he said he would play this game again in a week
you have to climb up the ladder to the next level
It's not just a game, you need a controller
you need to watch him in order to know if you're a real gamer
i just got here and what the fuck is this
I love how chat has been doing this for an hour LUL
@Jerma985 if you want to learn something, you need to find a way to make it easier
@Jerma985 I think you have to go back to the top
jerma you are the worst streamer on twitch
@Jerma985 What if you have a skin in your ass
@Jerma985 you're gonna get in trouble for getting to the bottom of a hill
He is trying to get the other person to eat
@Jerma985 You have to beat the game first
i need to put my money where my mouth is
@Jerma985 you're gonna lose the other guy if you have to use a lance
guys we need to know if you're using the gamecube controller
we need to make sure the streamer doesn't get banned
@Jerma985 you can't just be a bad dad
hey chat i got a gift sub :)
the people in the back are just crying
@Jerma985 It's the same guy who played this game.
@Jerma985 do you ever want to play Doki Doki?
what if you're a good boy and you're a good boy
The only way to change the world is to play Minecraft.
jermaWalk YEASHA jermaWalk WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
@Jerma985 I know it's a bit weird, but I love you
@Jerma985 You've been playing this for 12 hours straight
@Jerma985 You can play the other games as well, like the pachinko levels
Jerma's gonna play this for the rest of the stream
the frog is the leader of this tribe
can we get a shpee in the chat
@Jerma985 You can also run up a ladder to the next level
I love how jerma's voice is so low it's like a baby
@Jerma985 are you sure you didn't get a cat?
why is he taking a shit from the first person
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LEFT
I'm not sure if I can watch the stream with the jup so I'm watching a different streamer
its a game called the term "welcome to the gamer club"
Jerma you're going to have to play it again
@Jerma985 can you be a good dad
@Jerma985 JERMA ITS YOUR FAVORITE GAME YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT
i just got here and he's still playing this
@Jerma985 is that the guy that beat dark souls 3 on stream?
He got a headlock on the first day
@Jerma985 why is the guy on the right
====================
The more you talk the more you say
This is the streamer that beat the dark souls 3 boss on stream
@Jerma985 You could have gotten some more money if you had the gamecube controller
it's a funny game but it's not a funny game
@Jerma985 I was watching a stream and you were playing a game and you were just playing with a controller?
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer play this
jerma you can't just drink water with a sponge
@Jerma985 There's a card that gives you a bonus, but it's not for you
@Jerma985 You said you'd be doing the next one when you finished the other one
@Jerma985 You're not gonna get it if you go back
I remember when you were on the toilet at the zoo
@Jerma985 you're not supposed to play it on your own
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 2512. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
this is the worst joke I have ever seen
@Jerma985 you can't have one baby at a time
@Jerma985 you can get the same code for a lot of games
i think the other guy should be in the next one
why is there a bar for your car
jermaWalk JERMA GETTING A STREAMER'S GRILL jermaWalk
I can't believe Jerma is playing a DOS game jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you should play the game like you played it before
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -24. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 Are you planning to do more streams with the AI?
@Jerma985 i think this is the most racist thing you can do
@Jerma985 you can turn off the gameboy's microphone
jermaWalk jermaWalk ikr im going to go to bed
@Jerma985 The guy in the window is a gnome
jermaOld I was on my phone and you were on it
jerma is a professional chef, he cooks for you
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer play this
@Jerma985 I am the only one who can tell if you're doing it wrong
@Jerma985 you need to take the cogs off
Oh shit, I just got back. What's the stream title?
jermaOld i can't be here when he's late
@Jerma985 You know that all the time you've been playing this game?
Is this the streamer that beat the dark souls 3 boss on stream?
@Jerma985 I'm not sure you can do this to me, I'm trying to get a new one
Jerma the fact that you're so bad at this game makes me sick
you have to get the gun out of the tank
@Jerma985 you're gonna get stuck on the same spot for 5 minutes
@Jerma985 Can you turn off the game audio?
there's no reason to ever tell people about this
@Jerma985 You can tell when to turn off the game audio if you're in the area and not in the building
I thought it was a shoe jermaDisgust
@Jerma985 Please make this a game about the gang
@Jerma985 The first one you don't have to get out of the way
@Jerma985 How do you still have a car you've been driving around for the past 5 years
can't wait for the streamer to start the game
Why are you playing this game that is so boring
@Jerma985 You can buy a bike for the money.
This is why you're not a gamer @Jerma985
@Jerma985 go to the water park and eat a shoe
Jerma is just a Fucked Up Baby, I'll never know
i think its been like 2 hours
@Jerma985 Why are you using a controller with the keyboard in the back?
you are right, the game is giving you an advantage
jermaWalk IN THE NAME OF JERMA jermaWalk
@Jerma985 If you get a dog just get a dog
@Jerma985 PLEASE TELL ME YOU WONT HAVE A WEED FARM
@Jerma985 You have to do the next one
Jerma this is the most stressful stream I've ever watched
dont use the thing you got in the water
I'm sorry but I can't do it :(
this is the best part of the game
jermaPluto what do you mean, not that kind of game
I've been watching this for 5 years and I'm never gonna be able to catch it
do you think it's really hard to get your hands on this stuff?
You can't get to the middle of the map
====================
the only way to save the universe is to save the planet
I don't know if I can be the one to tell Jerma to stop streaming.
Jerma is still making this game? How did it go?
just because you don't like it doesn't mean you can't play it
jerma you are the only person i would trust
he said you were gonna take him down
why does he sound like a dog
@Jerma985 you need to make the next boss easier
@Jerma985 I'm going to take a nap on this boat
You can't do a lie, you have to tell it
@Jerma985 have you tried the new kinect game? it's the best.
@Jerma985 I'd love to see you play this game
this is the guy that died to the ghost of a lynch
"I can't keep you from me" -jerma985
@Jerma985 do a bit to get a little more of it
"I can't keep you from me" -jerma985
i just got here, is this the streamer that died to the ghost of a lynch?
i can't believe jerma is going to play minecraft again
Jerma would never stream this game again jermaPluto
You'll never get the final boss in this game, but you'll be able to kill him
@Jerma985 you have to find the "radio" to trigger the timer
@Jerma985 you can do it, you just need to be patient
The real Jerma would be a dreamcast with a controller
I'm not sure if it's just me or if it's all the people complaining about the game being hard
@Jerma985 you know you can do this on your own
@Jerma985 the only reason you ever streamed is because you're a fucking idiot
It's just a titty toothed for the fun of it
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the poor girl
what the hell did you do to my hair
you just got a camera for a single stream
@Jerma985 i was just watching the stream and it was weird
@Jerma985 You've been playing this for an hour.
@Jerma985 it's gonna be like this for the rest of the stream
@Jerma985 You've been playing this game for an hour
JERMA WHAT'S YOUR TOP 10 TURNING POINT OF ALL TIME
@Jerma985 if you don't get the boots you'll never get the boots

@Jerma985 please play the game i love it :)
why does this game sound like the first game of the new jedi
@Jerma985 can you get the "I'm the one" emote?
there's no way you can do that
I can't believe you're still playing this game
@Jerma985 The end is just like the beginning
@Jerma985 how many times has he been to the toilet
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game in the first place?
I want to know what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 Don't worry, it's not that hard to get in
Jerma is gonna make it out of this
@Jerma985 when are you going to play Half Life Alyx?
@Jerma985 the bottom of the game is a maze
This is the same as when he beat the first boss
just imagine how it would be if you hadnt put the controller in your pants
@Jerma985 it's just a simulation, you can't say you're doing it wrong
@Jerma985 if you have to restart it would be because of the sun
you should do a new game with the 3D music
you have to click on the maps to see the map
@Jerma985 you don't have to buy the DLCs
just walk into the fire to stop the explosion
I'd be a bit more excited for a Jerma stream, honestly
I just came back from a 9 hour nap, what happened?
@Jerma985 you have to hold your breath for that
@Jerma985 You need to find the circle to jump
@Jerma985 You need to do the other two
you're gonna end up doing the same thing over and over again
I think we can be friends now :)
@Jerma985 please play the new multiplayer level, it's really fun
@Jerma985 You have to use the car to move
@Jerma985 this game is too much of a porn game
@Jerma985 You can make the bot work
@Jerma985 can you not just go to the bathroom
I'm gonna kill you for this one.
it looks like he's trying to hide his wife
@Jerma985 How do you do this in a game?
====================
A man has been found dead in a dumpster in the southern California town of Vail, according to authorities.
@Jerma985 you have to beat the tutorial to progress, it's not easy
@Jerma985 when you go back to the beginning, do you still have the Labo?
@Jerma985 What is the name of the game?
@Jerma985 you can't use a link if you don't know what it's saying
The dumbest joke I've ever seen LUL
you have to get up at least once a day for it to work
@Jerma985 what if we are all just some random guy with no social skills and only live to be married
@Jerma985 do you not know what a jerma is
jermaChomp 📣 I WANT TO SEE YOU jermaChomp
jerma's gonna be late in like 6 hours
I'm gonna be honest I'm pretty sure that's all of you
@Jerma985 you can't get a good mickey mouse for less than $2
@Jerma985 You have to do a bunch of stuff
@Jerma985 What if we are the main villain?
You need to be careful with the gun

@Jerma985 are you going to play the Super Mario RPG game?
@Jerma985 Do you think that the cow would eat people
why would you give the cow a bad name
I can't believe jerma is actually a god gamer
If I don't get a jerma sub I'm gonna cry jermaPluto

@Jerma985 I'm not here for the stream, I'm here for the chat
this is what you call a fever dream
@Jerma985 What if you're a kid and you don't know how to use a hammer
@Jerma985 you can just walk around in your room
@Jerma985 What's the name of your new game?
It was a really good game, and it was fun to see you play it
you can still get a free drink from the vending machine
@Jerma985 It was the first time you played this game
I've been playing this game for the last 3 days and it's still not as good as it was
@Jerma985 the game doesnt want to show the dlc
if you can't beat the level, you can't beat the game.
@Jerma985 Can you stop this from happening to me?
This is like a fever dream of a game
@Jerma985 He's gonna be playing on the west coast, it's going to be sunny
@Jerma985 Don't worry, it's not a bad thing
i can't believe jerma is actually streaming this game jermaPluto
@Jerma985 This is the best part of the stream
@Jerma985 you don't have to do that, just stand still for 5 seconds
@Jerma985 The reason you were an asshole is because you played this game
@Jerma985 You should play the new metal gear.
it's a game where you have to put the money on your head
I think Jerma would like that though. I'm sure he'd love it
@Jerma985 are you going to play the game?
"This is a bad game, don't listen to me"
@Jerma985 that's what they said to the bank

The king was a fireman, he killed people
@Jerma985 I'm not gonna lie, I'm just excited
@Jerma985 you can do the backflip trick
@Jerma985 It's a good game, it's not worth wasting your time
@Jerma985 You should play an actual game
i like the first
====================
I think you can only read one word

@Jerma985 You should do a dvd version of this
you can't hit the end of the elevator @Jerma985
@Jerma985 You look like you are going to die
@Jerma985 you should put your facecam on the screen
i wasnt gonna say it but im sorry im an old man
YOU'RE THE BEST STREAMER I'VE EVER WATCHED AND YOU'RE THE BEST
@Jerma985 what if you're the only person on earth
the car in the bottom left is the one that has to be stopped

@Jerma985 when you get the heart, you need to put it on the screen and it will be easier to see the heart
@Jerma985 you can put a hole in the wall
i dont think the staff is that smart
"I'm gonna see you in the next few days"
I don't think they'll do it without your permission
@Jerma985 You should get a story mode that doesn't just tell you what the movie is
I'm gonna need to take a shit if I get one
how can you get into the sewer when there's a fucking bullet hole in the roof
my brother is a nice guy and he always yells at me when I'm not listening to his stream
I just saw this stream and now I'm really pissed
You have to get the toothpick from the other hand
i have been working for like 5 years
I’ve never seen that type of pizza
how can you say something so controversial and controversial
He's actually still in the cave, it's just a bunch of rocks
jermaPluto_RB I just got here and I see that you're still on this level
Why do you think it's the only good thing you have to say about the world?
This is the most epic thing I've ever seen
@Jerma985 There's a map on the bottom right of the screen
@Jerma985 If you read this, you're a sex offender
why is everyone in this game in the same place
it's like theres a boston pizza hut in the middle of a highway
@Jerma985 you can't play this game on a ps2 game console
imagine having a heart attack and dying
this guy has been gone for 6 hours
i was watching the vod and i was like "why is he still here?"
@Jerma985 you could always just not let the wolf go
S U P S P U N E
i thought this was the first time you streamed in a while
@Jerma985 There's a hidden feature on the bottom right of the screen, you can click it to see what's in the vent
Jerma, you're not a baby, you're a human
@Jerma985 you just had a break and the doctor was gone
this is the dark souls of hand simulator games
I can't believe Jerma has a fucking monkey brain
this is the most fucked thing ive ever seen
he was thinking of a sequel to the new house flipper
oh no, he's going to get the airpods stuck in his ear and it's gonna be worse
i can't believe he's playing as the clown
@Jerma985 It's a video game you can play in real time
@Jerma985 this is going to be a long one
jerma you're just like me in the chat
he doesn't even have the money for the carnival stream jermaPluto
Why do people think you can't drive a car?
@Jerma985 you can't get a new car in this level
If you can't beat the game, you can't play this game jermaPluto
he's just a little too dumb to understand the game
You can't go to the red door, you're trapped in the cave
@Jerma985 are you going to make a new animal
You need to play the music to get rid of the sadness
I'm in the mood for some kind of green tea
@Jerma985 do you think you can get the boots?
@Jerma985 Do you want to go to the carnival stream?
jerma you're a kid and you don't know how to throw

Jerma is going to get a heart attack because of this game
@Jerma985 what are you doing with your life?
you need to put the iron in the water
J
====================
ALEXANDER WAS PUSHED OUT OF HIS HANDS
@Jerma985 Do you think you're a real gamer?
You're probably gonna have to do a lot of more work to get this game
@Jerma985 I think it's a boomer thing, I think it's the same thing with both of them
@Jerma985 You can't move your body for 2 minutes
I'm gonna miss the stream so much. I wish I could be there
the main character is a fucking gremlin dude
@Jerma985 You can't do that with a sword
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to play the other games
@Jerma985 you have to have a good job
You have to be on the map to get it
YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM BEING BORED, JERMA.
@Jerma985 get a top down video of a man wearing a diaper and then put that in the room
jermaWalk OH GOD IT'S THE TUBER THE TUBER jermaWalk
if he dies in the game he dies in real life
@Jerma985 You should turn it on and on again
they arent going to come back if you don't take them
how do you even make a fucking soup
the best part of a cooking stream is the cooking commentary
@Jerma985 you can't use the same controller in a game that isnt a soup.
@Jerma985 How do you get the other one?
@Jerma985 you can't hit the ground and then fall in water
i think he just isnt listening to the game
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game without your dog?
@Jerma985 you need to get the boots
@Jerma985 There are a couple of exceptions though
@Jerma985 why is the last word "puke" in the title
I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
@Jerma985 when is the next stream where you play with your friends?
how do you get a dad to do this?
@Jerma985 You should play the game with the little girl
you've been dead for 5 years jerma, you need to go back

@Jerma985 You can have the second one with a gun
@Jerma985 There's a timer, you have to keep going until it's over.
just go in the room with him and shoot him with the bow
Jerma, this is a copypasta, you can't be serious
That's how you get your teeth out
i heard that jerma985 had a crush on a man
@Jerma985 YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS
@Jerma985 you can press ctrl + c to cycle through the buttons
You have to kill them first and not just the boss
I'm only here because I'm watching Jerma get mad at this game
@Jerma985 you look like a zombie from a zombie movie
@Jerma985 YOU JUST PLAYED THE MEGA MILK GAME
jermaChomp IM ON THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE BOTTOM LINE
@Jerma985 do a joke where you play a game and people spam the word "peepoHappy"
HE'S GONNA GET ALL OF THEM UNTIL YOU GET ANOTHER
is this the streamer that got addicted to the pacman
@Jerma985 you can do the other one if you have the boots
@Jerma985 please go back to your couch and put the keys in
Why is this streamer so bad at it?
@Jerma985 Please tell me you're not a psycho

@Jerma985 You can get an item that makes your character even stronger
you can throw the grenade to kill him
@Jerma985 please put the T.V. music in the background
@Jerma985 you can use the middle mouse button to move
@Jerma985 Please tell us you're not a gamer. :)
jerma please don't do this to me, i want to sleep
@Jerma985 What is the name of the song
@Jerma985 Did you not see the vod for the funny meme clip?
you cant even get in the boat and get out
@Jerma985 The 2nd one is on the top
@Jerma985 you can't just do the first one
this guy looks like a lost cause
@Jerma985 YOU'RE NOT A GIRLFRIEND, JUST THE RAT jermaChomp
@Jerma985 It's not a good game, it's not a good stream
@Jerma985 Do you have any favorite sonic game?

====================
Jerma, have you ever played the game of thrones, or is it a black hole?
i can't believe the boomer is still playing this game
this game is a fucking nightmare, I love it
@Jerma985 I dont think they could put you on a level without the FOV
@Jerma985 It's literally the best game ever made
@Jerma985 I'm glad you're doing this, I'm glad you're doing this
I thought it was a horror game LUL
You're supposed to be the one doing the fighting
I have a 50/50 chance of getting a bowl of soup
@Jerma985 You can use the d-pad to hold on to objects and jump, it's not that hard
@Jerma985 no, it's a black hole, and it's not just a black hole
@Jerma985 it's only a little over a month, if you can count it
@Jerma985 Please stop talking about your private information. I'm worried for your health.
@Jerma985 you can't just read the comments and not know what's going on
You don't have to use the other options
@Jerma985 put it on your nose so it shows up as your mouth
@Jerma985 I think you need to get an eye for it
how do you think jerma reads chat? LUL
it's like a little stream for him, but with a big time limit
I just came back and I saw Jerma's face
@Jerma985 When do you think you will play this game?
it's just like what happens when you eat a shoe
@Jerma985 can we get a real-time sub sound?
i just want to see you play the game
i remember when this was a jerma stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 do you want a steak or a raw fish?
@Jerma985 if you have to do it twice, do it one time and then do the same again
I'm here to help, I'm here to tell you about this game jermaVenus
this game is so much better than the original
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game
I can't believe Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -316.
How many times have we told you that you're not funny?
@Jerma985 I just want to see you play this game jermaPluto
@Jerma985 The first 3 times you have to do this mission
@Jerma985 You're still in the woods, but you are the one doing it.
@Jerma985 you're gonna need a new vehicle for the next mission
This is how the demon of hatred kills you
I just got here what the fuck is happening
SourPls THIS IS NOT THE GAME TO WATCH SourPls
Jerma, why are you so bad at this game
HE HAS TO DO THE POINT ON THE MOON
@Jerma985 Why are you the only one that makes this game?
@Jerma985 You need to be a professional gamer to be able to play this game
This is the most frustrating game I've ever seen
I wish i had a better idea of what's going on with this
I think you are going to have a lot of problems with that
i dont think you can do this in real life
oh god he can't see his hands, he can't see his feet
i think he shouldnt be playing it, he'd be doing it anyway
@Jerma985 You are a hero, you are a hero
@Jerma985 This is like watching a toddler play with toys
you can get more enemies in the boss fight
I can't believe jerma is actually a real gamer
@Jerma985 Are you going to play the Fortnite OST?
You're gonna get hit by the car, Jerma.
i cant believe jerma is playing this game
you have to use the other options @Jerma985
jerma is a modern day version of the painter
@Jerma985 you are going to be playing this for a while
jermaOtto "I'm in a place where everything is a waste of time"
@Jerma985 can you mute the game audio so i can make it better?
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
@Jerma985 The thing is a little tiny little man
@Jerma985 You should play a game with a different story
you can make a giant zombie that you can just build
@Jerma985 You have to kill the guy in the bridge
dude you guys are idiots and we're all just fucking with you
@Jerma985 I dont think you can do this
the bird is my favourite, it's the best
@Jerma985 I'd like to see you do a Shmadow
I
====================
Aight, well, I'll see you in a couple hours, see you in a couple months, and then I'll be able to come back. I'm sure you can handle it, Jerma.
the game is just a big brain game
i think he's just gonna be doing it for the next 12 hours
what if he doesn't get the coin jermaPluto
@Jerma985 please explain your outfit so we can make our own
@Jerma985 you have to do a trip around the house and you have to make a staircase
@Jerma985 you can't get the green, it's a cheat
@Jerma985 Do you think that the game is a game for kids?
i just got here what the fuck is this
i really like the old one that you can get
you can't get it for like 2 months
you just need to do it one at a time
I don't know if you can see the milk
@Jerma985 don't worry, the game will get better soon, so just keep playing it
@Jerma985 He's going to be playing Animal Crossing after this stream
@Jerma985 This is the worst part of the game
@Jerma985 It's not a lie, it's an actual thing
Oh yeah, he's actually gonna get hit by the car
It's the only way to get a good ending
@Jerma985 don't forget to get the coin, it's on the second floor
@Jerma985 you know what to do with that money
i think the game is a huge mess
Jerma985 is that the guy who died to pinwheel
jermaVenus i thought that was a meme jermaVenus
Jerma is going to be late. He can't stream today.
@Jerma985 You know I don't think you know what a "soup" is
I don't think it's a good idea to have a character that's just "you"
@Jerma985 You're going to get the key and get it back.
what if the guards have no fucking money?
I remember watching this stream from the future and it was literally just Jerma doing this LUL
how do you get your hands in a situation like this
the stream will be over in 30 seconds
@Jerma985 Do you think that the people in this game are really that bad
Jerma I love your stream. I love you.
I can't believe Jerma is in the basement
i can't believe this is just a jerma stream jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you have to do a loop for the bathroom
the story is pretty bad, i'm gonna be honest
i don't know what that is but i like it
Jerma is the giant rat that makes all of the rules
i am so happy i got gifted a sub by jerma
@Jerma985 You're gonna be having fun with this game.
jerma has been a chad for the past decade
@Jerma985 You can start the stream at 5pm PST
@Jerma985 You can do this in the beginning but it's very hard
@Jerma985 you could put a little bit of wood in there for the one guy
@Jerma985 It's not a lot, it's just a long time
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
if you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 why are you so bad at this game
jermaWalk ILL ILL COME BACK TO THE WALLS jermaWalk
What the fuck, this is the same guy who got the copy of this game and never came back
He is an engineer and can't get a job.
@Jerma985 you are literally the best streamer on twitch
@Jerma985 There's a camera in the top right corner
Is this the streamer that beat the first part of AYAYA?
jermaOld i'm sorry, it's just a bunch of old songs
why is there a broken screen in the back?
if you die to pinwheel, you die to pinwheel
@Jerma985 i want to see you on stream
Jerma is a fucking VOMIT streamer! He can't even get past the first level of a level
imagine if you said that to him
this is the best way to end the stream
jermaVenus It's not an episode of the 90s
@Jerma985 You have to shoot the fish first
What is this, a game where you can build houses?
I think it's just a stupid and short game, maybe the rest is just stupid and short
@Jerma985 What about the time you were drunk?
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS AFTER YOU HAD THE HAT
I
====================
WHAT A STREAMER, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN SUBSCRIBED FOR THIS YEAR
@Jerma985 How many times are we going to play this
@Jerma985 this is the worst game you've ever played
@Jerma985 just let the memory card die, it's better than dying
@Jerma985 you can't stop the stream you are already late
@Jerma985 Don't look at my comment I'm a good boy, I have a nice lawn
dont forget to take your dog to the vet
that was the worst part of the stream
@Jerma985 I'm a fan of your streams, you have some great content, but you're too short
@Jerma985 Can you make a "nice lawn" at the top of your house?
I don't know what you're doing but I love it
@Jerma985 have you ever seen a cooking streamer?
@Jerma985 the last time you had a chance to play it you were eating it
He's got some kind of joker tattoo of his head on his chest
This is the most generic game ever made
@Jerma985 Don't worry, I'll be there to help
@Jerma985 This is what you have to do to earn your own badge
@Jerma985 you can put your finger in the other
this is just a bunch of kids playing a video game
You have to get your butt kicked by the pachinko guy
@Jerma985 you can't be in the middle of a road
i love how you guys are trying to make this joke work
I'm not the only one who thinks this is the best game ever made
I'm the person who made the "im gonna go crazy" joke
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, I just got here, what's your favorite song?
@Jerma985 Please stop doing the FISH, I want to see you beat this game!
@Jerma985 You can stop talking now, I'm in the bathroom and you're still talking about the ocean!
it would be like jerma is the giant rat
i have a rare corona virus called coronavirus
B A S S O R S T I M E
@Jerma985 can we play more of your old videos?
I would like to thank you for the gift sub! <3
You can't even see the top of your head
@Jerma985 Can you play the entire game?
it's the only way to get a better ending
@Jerma985 Use the giant pot to fill it with water
@Jerma985 how do you feel about a game that you don't know how to play
@Jerma985 I would never do that. It would be a crime
If it's not a virtual reality game then why is it a virtual reality game?
@Jerma985 what did you say about the movie?
this is the most boring shit I've seen
If he doesn't have a controller I'm gonna feel bad
The best stream of all time, Jerma.
@Jerma985 you have to get the LISA card for the VR thing
how do you even make a family name
theres a high chance you are actually playing this game
@Jerma985 theres a slight delay in the music
That's the thing I like about this game
@Jerma985 You are going to get a heart attack
@Jerma985 What's the name of the game?
@Jerma985 It's like a game for people who are just having fun with their PC's
@Jerma985 A bunch of people are going to die
I feel like the game has been spoiled by people playing it for years
@Jerma985 this is the only game you've ever played
how many times has he said "go home"
what if you can't get the whole thing?
@Jerma985 it was so much easier to get the meat
@Jerma985 do a stream where you make your own jokes
i dont think i can watch any of the vods anymore
@Jerma985 Make a jerma985_wii_wii_wii_wii_wii_wii emote and it's pretty cool
@Jerma985 the doctor has a different opinion
@Jerma985 when are you gonna stream the whole thing?
@Jerma985 It's been 5 years since you last played it. I hope you enjoy the game.
@Jerma985 you can do it with the wii
@Jerma985 It's not a new game, it's a shitty game
I'm a really nice person, but I'm just gonna say you are the best
@Jerma985 are you going to be able to afford to stream with Jerma?
i dont think jerma is
====================
Giant enemy spider was made by the same people who made this game
@Jerma985 I thought you were gonna say that about the Pills. It's very different than this game.
I just realized you can do it, what a god gamer
that's how they all look at you when they're in the hospital
you can't have a food coma jerma, that's not how it works
is this the streamer that beat the game on stream?
@Jerma985 if you want to play this game, you have to buy a controller
@Jerma985 I want to know how you feel about the clown car
is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 I want to go to sleep, but I'm not here PepeHands
You need to have a dog that is not a clown
@Jerma985 Have you ever been to a casino?
@Jerma985 you're a human being and it's weird
jermaDafoe Jerma, please stop playing this game. I’m worried about my mother.
@Jerma985 you can get a free item from the main menu
@Jerma985 go to the right side of the room and select the top rope
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE BALL FOR THE OTHER TOO
@Jerma985 you should do a facecam at the end of each level, I think it will be so funny
I'm trying to find a good game to play :)
Jerma you should have a better idea of what the game is
Just like the pokemon, it's a video game
Hey Jerma, just got here, what happened to the green screen stream?
they really don't know what to do with their money
you have to go to the doctor, you can't have a baby
he's got a gun he doesn't have a weapon
@Jerma985 What if we kissed and you could’t see us?
This is just the end of the movie
I thought it was just a vod lol
If you die in the game you die in real life
you need to put the timer to start the stream, you dont need to wait until the end
@Jerma985 Make sure to kill him first before you kill him
imagine being a fucking cop and being able to type something out in chat
@Jerma985 no you have to use your legs to jump
if you were a fan of the game you'd know how to play it
jerma is going to be so angry at this game LUL
I don't know if you're going to play it, but it's fun to watch
JERMA YOU CAN'T JUST MURDER YOUR OWN SKULL
@Jerma985 YOU ARE IN A DOG SLEEPING GAME
@Jerma985 you can't leave a door open, you're not allowed to leave a door open
@Jerma985 i heard you can't play these games, you're too dumb
you need to get the shit out of the chair
The only good thing about this game is the sound effects
@Jerma985 you know what to do jerma, put on the bandana
@Jerma985 the actual voice acting in this game is fucking amazing
I bet you want to be a mod
@Jerma985 I'm not sure what the fuck you're talking about
@Jerma985 you have to beat the boss to get more money
I'm gonna be real here. This is a bad game.
@Jerma985 are you sure this isnt the real game
i was watching a video of you and it got deleted
The fucking whole movie is just a fight scene
I wish I could make a call to action
I can't believe Jerma is going to play this game again
you have to get the other two pieces
its the last of us, we are the ones that have to do this
I got the bad ending on the second level
@Jerma985 He is the guy who murdered your dad
we need to get a jermaSour emote in here
HE'S BEEN IN A COMA FOR YEARS LUL
@Jerma985 if you die in the game you die in real life
Jerma should play a game like this
I just got here, what the hell is happening?
@Jerma985 you can do this for free :)
you can't get it on your own
@Jerma985 i bet you're not a real gamer
i hope it's not too early for the stream
@Jerma985 please keep the torches in the water, it's not that important
@Jerma985 JERMA I HAVE TO GO TO WORK RIGHT NOW
I mean I'll have to wait a day for that
@Jerma985 That was the first time you've ever told that story

====================
I'm just gonna say hi to everyone :)
I'm pretty sure the other car is the dead guy
The best part of the stream is when he finally gets to the game
i just came back from watching the vod, is jerma still in the game?
@Jerma985 you look like you're going to die
@Jerma985 There are literally just a few parts that need to be fixed
i will be the first to say hi :)
when are you going to do a wacky dance
jermaWalk jermaWalk I'LL MAKE YOU HACK YOURSELF jermaWalk
and jerma is the one who posts the memes on his main channel
This is the streamer that died to Pinwheel ON STREAM
@Jerma985 I think you need to speed up the clock
its like if a kid in a video game is just telling the story
@Jerma985 So you're gonna be a full time streamer?
HES SO SMALL HE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO RUN
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, I'm excited to see you in the stream. Can you not stop showing off your amazing gamer skills?
You're the only one that gets to stream
this is the most RARE game ever made
@Jerma985 You have to get the back up
@Jerma985 Just do it to get the bonus
I think you're gonna get a lot of free items
what the fuck is this "gamecube" thing?

====================
The world is going to end in 12 hours
@Jerma985 you're not supposed to use a word that isn't "tricked"
Jerma is a communist and a nazi. He hates all non-whites
@Jerma985 if you're a fan of the VOD, you should be able to follow the VOD
@Jerma985 why are you doing a sekiro stream today?
@Jerma985 can you turn down the game audio please
Jerma you need to play more Mario Maker 2
if you're good at something never do it for free
I mean, he was playing it on the Wii, not the Switch, so it's pretty obvious
The fact that you're just throwing it away is the key to your success
@Jerma985 you're going to get banned for streaming the game LUL
@Jerma985 this is just a modded version of the main game
@Jerma985 JERMA IF YOU DIE YOU DIE DREAM YOU DREAMER
@Jerma985 theres a music clip of you saying "it was good"
i've never heard of the otto thing before but im sure it's something
If you don't play the game for the next hour you'll have to play this for the rest of it
jerma is getting more and more nervous monkaS
@Jerma985 you need to be in the middle of the road to get to the highway
@Jerma985 We have a door here! There's a door!
this is the guy that died to pinwheel
This is the same guy who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
Jerma's going to have a heart attack playing this
I got a gift sub for Jerma985, what a good boy
@Jerma985 What happened to the game that was just a cooking stream?
We need to know the next minute's worth of Jerma's hair
i thought jerma said he was doing a christmas stream
he's gonna start a new game and then play it at the same time
i thought you said "Jerma's just gonna play it and play it for a while"
@Jerma985 you should do a rewind with the rocket launcher
you're not going to get banned for doing this
the funny voice is actually really good for a joke
Just do the damn circle from the right
we need to get the full stream of the stream for this
how are you doing the tutorial again?
@Jerma985 is this a pog stream? You're the only one who has the funny voice LUL
@Jerma985 it's a really cool looking game
@Jerma985 you need to make it to the building
The best joke taking more than 5 minutes to set up is the one where Jerma says the word "sour" and then the stream starts
oh my god this is so fucking funny
its like a football game where the football is the real thing
jermaPluto Jerma is a child now and he's going to be a parent for the rest of his life
Dude this game is way more fun than watching you play it
@Jerma985 you can put the flash games in a new game
@Jerma985 You gotta have the boots first Kappa
this is just a prerecorded chat with you
i'm not even real. i'm just a "huh"
Why do you have to do this to me?
@Jerma985 Just go to the forest and kill the deer
@Jerma985 Put the card back in its place
I think this is the hardest part of the game
jermaTV is my favorite emote. I can't believe jerma has made it to this
Jerma is the King of the Jungle, I will take all of your money jermaVenus
@Jerma985 If you don't hit the door then you can go back
you can only get 10k points in the first game
This is the most peaceful chat I have ever seen
@Jerma985 you can't get in a car, you can't get out
@Jerma985 Just imagine a random person in the audience
@Jerma985 This game has a lot of cool stuff
why does this game have a high character count?
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT TO WORK
how many times has he played this game
This is just the first part of a 5 minute slow mode
Jerma, I think you need to go back to the town
I'll be back in 30 minutes and you will be fine
I just joined and I am absolutely convinced that Jerma is a bad parent
oh fuck, that's so stupid, i'm so sorry jerma
@Jerma985 You can put the other person's face on the other side of the screen
you can be a lot of different things at once
I'd
====================
This is the first time I've ever seen a Jerma stream, and it's the most jerma shit ever
@Jerma985 You can just play the game again
He's going to have a whole lot of trouble with it
@Jerma985 There are a lot of "you need to kill a guard" jokes, don't listen to them
He's still going to be a Jerma fan?
I'm gonna be so sad when I hear that
i wonder if he'll play a vr game like this
i think i just had a big sip of water and it just started to boil my teeth
Jerma is a mod, he has no control over the game
i cant believe jerma is the new face of twitch
if you dont know what you are doing
@Jerma985 you have to be a sub to get the free sub
@Jerma985 you're not supposed to read messages, just be careful
@Jerma985 "There's a secret in the elevator"
I think you need to turn off the audio for this level
i hope jerma doesnt play this for too long
@Jerma985 you have to fight to get the good ending
@Jerma985 this is like a tutorial for the tutorial
@Jerma985 you gotta do the fishing with the fish
you need to find a way to shoot the little gun
I just got here. Is this the streamer that beat NGUY ON STREAM???
@Jerma985 You're going to be having a heart attack if you don't get the boots
I mean, a lot of people have been saying that
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you ask the old man to play a game for a second
@Jerma985 Your so bad at this game. Go to the hospital.
@Jerma985 get rid of the half life 2 OST
@Jerma985 you look like a dog right now
jerma you need to stop getting the rat
You can't say anything with no consequences

A MAN HAS BEEN DRUGGING HIS OWN EGGS, HE DOESN'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE EGGS
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN DRUGGING YOUR OWN EGGS, HE DOESN'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE EGGS
the one where the guy is a goblin
I like this music, it's just sad to hear Jerma's voice
I'm gonna have to give you a sub
@Jerma985 You're gonna have to get some people to buy them.
its a full moon jerma and you are still naked
@Jerma985 This is the first stream where you don't play the game
@Jerma985 You need to make a new character.
the boomer guy would be cool in this game
how can you be this bad at video games
I'm still stuck on this one Jerma. I can't see anything
Just go in the mirror and show your face
@Jerma985 you're the one who wrote this song
You can't win without the boots! You can't win without the boots!
I just got here, what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 are you playing the real version of this game?
I can't believe jerma is in the "Joke" category
jermaVenus jermaVenus if you don't get this message you're a liar
jerma would make a nice girl for a girl
"I want to see my wife" - "I want to see my wife"
Can you imagine if jerma just turned into a clown and just just started to play it
That's what I thought it was gonna be
it's because you are a bad boy jermaSun
this is just a game of the books
I'm going to do what I can to help you
jermaWalk it's time to get out of here jermaWalk
jerma you have to go back to the beginning
it's not a joke, it's an actual joke
This game is the dark souls of RTS games
@Jerma985 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAN'T TAKE THE BULLET
theres a man in my back yard
this is the greatest art direction of all time
We're in the midst of a new generation of Jerma fans.
jermaPluto It's the dark side of the galaxy
I can't wait to see you play this game!
how does this kid even get a controller
Jerma is a child that is not grown up
why are you trying to do the same thing as him
He's gonna be so mad at the game LUL
@Jerma985 You're not a fake streamer, you're the streamer
you have to do the whole thing to get the ending
@Jerma985 that's not a joke. I'm sorry to hear that.
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to be a hardy boy to get the boots
@Jerma985 Just move to the next level for the boots
@Jerma985 I think this game is too boring for you
@Jerma985 go to the last spot on the screen, then use the hammer
He's a kid, he doesn't know what a porn game is
@Jerma985 So you're saying that this is a simulation?
Jerma, why are you playing this game for the first time?
I don't know if I can keep my word.
@Jerma985 This is the dark souls of RTS games
@Jerma985 YOU NEED TO BUY THE BUGS TO THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM
@Jerma985 PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
You can't be a mod, you're a child
It's like when a baby learns how to play a game and its all grown up
@Jerma985 Please don't give me a free sub
i thought this was a kids game
It's a new game, it's not good
oh wait this is the last time he's gonna be here
@Jerma985 Do you think you can make it to the end without dying?
@Jerma985 i think you have to destroy the fish
i think the combat in this game is good
@Jerma985 do you even know how to use a controller?
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play this for another hour?
@Jerma985 you should just play the game for you
you should have a -2 to the person that said it
@Jerma985 you look like you're in a war room
there are so many choices in this game
how many times have you been raided
@Jerma985 can you do a tier list for me
I think it's in the mail for you
jerma is still playing this game because he's sick
it's really cool,
====================
Is this the streamer who beat the game on stream?
You know it's not a joke that the game is actually just a shitty tutorial
@Jerma985 The only time you're going to do that is with a high risk fallacy
@Jerma985 get the rat emote in the corner
HEY CHAT, I just got here, what is this?
@Jerma985 You don't need to spend time to get a job in the first place
you need to get out of the way of the door
I dont know who that is but I am.

Oh my god he's still playing this game?
@Jerma985 I need to make my own bread, please

it's almost like hes just a shitty clone
Oh god, I'm going to have a mental breakdown
this is the dark souls of mario games
@Jerma985 What do you think about the english version?
@Jerma985 There's a hole in the wall behind the door
you're not going to beat the game this time
@Jerma985 please put on the new music, it really makes me feel better
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure you can do this, you can just keep using the clip.
@Jerma985 is the streamer still going to be late?
@Jerma985 I'm really surprised you're still playing this, I can't believe you'd be playing this
I've never seen this game before, is this the game with the big bros

@Jerma985 hey jerma, have you ever played The Sims 2? I think it would be really fun
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game? I'm going to go to sleep
Jerma I just got a new laptop, can you give it to me please?
THEY'RE THE BEST OF THE ZOOMERS, THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WIN
I got a new laptop and it's a great game
@Jerma985 you can do that on the ds
theres a 100% chance you're not a true gamer
i like the ukulele and the scissors combo
@Jerma985 I don't think you can hit your mouse
I can't wait for you to get a surprise for the christmas stream
@Jerma985 can you do a 30 second slow mode please
"im just going to hit the wall" - Jerma985
he's gonna get a new one with a facecam
@Jerma985 it's the "I'm gonna be dead in 2 days" joke
@Jerma985 I'm gonna make you a pizza and we'll have a 24 hour stream
jermaOld can't even take a shit anymore :(
@Jerma985 The first 5 times you have to reload to get the last one
I like how he's not even here LUL
@Jerma985 You gotta check the phone, it says you're actually in the chat
@Jerma985 I can't believe you got a card game
@Jerma985 use the fish to turn them into food
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you can get a free boat from the boat
jerma, if you're a boomer and you're playing a game that is for kids
I'm so fucking excited for the carnival stream jermaVenus
its going to be a great stream :)
He's going to have a meltdown in the theater
why is the movie so dark? you can't see it
You gotta be a clown to scare the boss
@Jerma985 What the fuck is that robot guy doing?
@Jerma985 I think the guy on the left is a troll
I don't know how to play this game
@Jerma985 the bomb is meant to be a blunt weapon
I've been watching you for the past week, you should know that you can easily make a good joke by being honest about what you're saying.
i dont think i have the attention span for this
@Jerma985 you need to make a cake for the next stream
Hey Jerma, how much did I miss out on?
the only good thing about kiwo is the amount of bad shit she does
if you had a car you would be able to drive it
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this game
the devs of this game were great and made a lot of good games
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup4
jerma can you put on the shirt and make the character look like you?
I like how he just thinks of this as an E3 presentation
I hope he does it in a bathroom
jermaWalk i'm going to the hospital, can you guys stop watching the stream?
@Jerma985 if you eat your own ass you'll be fine
how can you be mad at a game that looks like this LUL
I'm gonna be a good boy, just keep going jermaHeart
@Jerma985 remember when you said you would play simpsons hit and run?
it was a tiny but very nice thing
@Jerma985 You should play the other games after this one
Jerma you're the only person I know who isnt afraid of the bugs
you have to do a fortnite accent and put it on first
@Jerma985 you can equip a hand to make a spear
I'm gonna go to sleep with my kids :)
i dont think its that big of a deal
@Jerma985 theres a big hole in the wall
@Jerma985 the other 10% is going to be the guy
"I'm going to go get my shower" - jerma985
Jerma has a bad habit of not knowing the rules
imagine not having to pay for jermaTV
@Jerma985 If you did that it would be crazy
@Jerma985 you can do it in a bathroom
@Jerma985 This is the hardest boss in the game
@Jerma985 What about the Bugleberry video where you play as the house flipper?

====================
@Jerma985 When you go to the bed, you can find the baby at the top right
the game is gonna be so hard for you
why do you look like a giant spider
Can you make a Jerma985 reference in the chat?
I hope you get to the other side of the screen
@Jerma985 why do you have a vive in your room
Why are you playing a game you dont like?
@Jerma985 This is the first level of the game
jerma is a boomer and he doesn't know how to turn on the lights
@Jerma985 You can unlock the doors from the secret areas
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get the funny points if you don't give it a shot
you were doing it wrong and you're still doing it right
how the fuck is this even possible? LUL
he just got the new gmod one with that new shit
@Jerma985 You'll need to turn off the dota2 audio on your phone
Jerma, you were just having a fun time and now you're not having fun
jermaOld back in my day we had to watch jerma
i have a feeling he'll turn on the stream
you have to put it on the toilet
Jerma can we get some Grown Ups in chat
@Jerma985 you have to jump over the tree
How do I turn off the game, please?
This is the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 im pretty sure you can see the portal portal
how is this game not a god of a gamer
this is the best game i have ever seen
jermaPluto he has to go to the hospital for this
jermaOld the old days of getting drunk at the movies
this is a good game, i cant wait to see theres a giant enemy spider in the background
@Jerma985 You're going to need to do the other stuff
jerma, you're so close to the end of the game
@Jerma985 Hey, have you ever played Mount and Blade?
@Jerma985 you just need to do the "Havent heard of this game" thing
@Jerma985 Have you seen the original 2?
i just got here and im just watching this
@Jerma985 the end of the game is the end
@Jerma985 you can't have a family if you don't have a wife.
@Jerma985 Please make a new game, it's the best one
This is the dark souls of pixel games
you're gonna have to do this for the whole time
That was the last time he played the game
@Jerma985 You have to beat the game first
YOU'RE NOT A CHEATER YOU ARE A COWARD
you just got the ring by using a special item
I'm going to go into the basement and kill everyone
@Jerma985 I think this is a bad idea
jermaWalk YOU NEED TO WATCH MORE MOVIES jermaWalk
JERMA THE GAME IS THE SAME GAME AS DREW
That's why you didn't put the crossbow on your back
@Jerma985 You can put an eye on the body
this game is a lot more fun than it used to be
imagine just walking into a kitchen and asking for a pan and then getting stuck
I just got here and I can't believe this is a real game
Jerma is a wuss, he doesn't understand the game
oh god i just realized this is the prequels
@Jerma985 Can you pause the game for a second?
@Jerma985 If you do that, you will get addicted to drugs
how long did you have to go to get that green
it is the first time you've played this game
You can get the no family option if you've been playing it for 6 hours
I think he's a boomer so he knows how to turn on the lights
jermaOld I'm not a boomer, I'm just a boomer
how did jerma get this far in the game?
the only reason i know to play this game is the fact that i'm a boomer
I want to know if he's playing this game
you can do it but you need to move
@Jerma985 YOU JUST DIDN'T DO THE SOUND EFFECTS JERMA
there are no changes in the game, you are still playing
Jerma can't even get the secret boss jermaPluto
you can't get it if you don't have a wife
you can't tell if it's a water filter or a flat surface
@Jerma985 this is just the back of your head
jermaWalk You can't be in the middle of a conversation with me
imagine if you had a computer that could do this

====================
Apex is the best company in the game.
@Jerma985 The game is called "This is how the world works"
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
@Jerma985 I've been playing this game for years and I still love it.
do you need to do it twice in a row?
I thought it was a joke, it's actually really funny
@Jerma985 I'm pretty sure you just said that because I've never seen it before.
Jerma's voice is the sound of a kid getting a new car
@Jerma985 This game is like watching an old man play a game.
Is this the streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
jermaOld I just got back from a vacation, can you give me your password?
cheer250 Jerma, you're still gonna be in a fucking coma for this?
i just got here. why is this game so shitty
I can't believe Jerma's streaming today, this is a fever dream
this guy is a psycho right now LUL
I want to be your girlfriend but you're a psycho
the only good thing about this game is the fucking music
I've been playing this for years and I still love it
jermaOld PUT THESE KIDS TO SLEEP WILL YA
@Jerma985 This is what you say to a kid
I'd be better off with a water filter
I'm gonna say it, I'm gonna say it, I'm gonna say it
you should play the demo of this game
i dont think it's the same as the first one
this is why you shouldnt play this game
this is the only time I've ever heard Jerma say that
@Jerma985 play the game i want to see you play
@Jerma985 you can't shoot things, you have to shoot them
@Jerma985 I think you're supposed to shoot them
@Jerma985 Why is there a live action jerma video
jerma i just got here, why is he playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 you should try and find the one with the blue bramble
the song is the same as "The Great Fire"
I would like to know how many times the streamer has died
is he actually streaming? I just got here
you're the only person who can do this
this is like a 10 year old's game
i dont think the teacher is a real person
@Jerma985 why is your character a dog?
@Jerma985 You can't be a boy without the toy
this is like watching a youtube vid where you just have to be a rat
Jerma, you're supposed to be doing this to yourself.
@Jerma985 That's what you said about the planet you're playing
Why is the mic mic in the corner?
it's okay jerma, we all love you jermaHeart
The people who worked on this game are not in the chat anymore.
@Jerma985 Make a VR game where you play as the dog
@Jerma985 The only good thing about this game is the music
@Jerma985 I have a question. Do you really think it's funny that you're in the middle of an entire town and everyone is just screaming at you to stop?
@Jerma985 you need to make a 2nd level
@Jerma985 you need to save the other one
@Jerma985 turn off the music please :)
that's what you do when you're in the mood
@Jerma985 Make a podcast that is based off of the stream
@Jerma985 If you don't have a sub you don't deserve a sub jermaPluto
how do you think a fish is supposed to taste like a lemon?
just because you're a dumbass doesnt make you a good person
just send them to the carnival and they'll be fine
@Jerma985 You can only buy one of them
I had a dream where Jerma said "you can't do this"
I remember when it was like a week
jermaWalk jermaWalk I’m gonna be a fuckin asshole and I’ll be the asshole jermaWalk
@Jerma985 the old lady is a mutant and can make all of the rules
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the fuck
@Jerma985 I heard you did this to yourself
you're like a child in a candy store
@Jerma985 you know how to get the heart?
JERMA WHERE IS THE WATER BOAT? WHERE IS IT?
I'm glad I caught your stream live, thank you for that.
@Jerma985 do you not know how to ride a bike
@Jerma985 do you know if you can hear the song?
====================
JERMA
If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 he's gonna make you cry, you can stop him now
what's up with the one with the goldfish
@Jerma985 "The game is rigged" is not a good way to describe this
@Jerma985 I think you might be a bit of a robot, that's why you're always looking at the camera.
Jerma has to be a fiddler, it's the only way
@Jerma985 you look like the old lady from the simpsons hit and run
@Jerma985 It's the same thing as the first one, they're both making fun of you
what do you mean... i'm not in the mood for this
@Jerma985 I thought it was a typo, it's not.
@Jerma985 You're a bit late for the stream, what happened?
jerma is gonna be in the next rumble
I've been watching this for years and I love it
jermaChomp jermaChomp 📣 I'M GONNA SHIT MY PANTS
@Jerma985 Please turn off the game and play the game again
I heard they got you to play the game for the first time
@Jerma985 no, you're the one who put the pig in the back
it was fun because you always had the attention span of a kid
@Jerma985 You have to jump over the wall to climb
@Jerma985 Is this the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 i'm going to take a nap please hurry up
you can't find a game that is actually good
i can't believe jerma has a wii on his desk
@Jerma985 The key is in the right slot
The amount of times you have to say something to the boss LUL
I never thought you'd do this to me
@Jerma985 you can use the gun to cut him off with the staff
It's like a video game with a dialogue system
@Jerma985 you're gonna get more money in the game
Jerma, if you're not doing a good job you're not doing a good job
i just got here and what is this
i think he was playing a different game
I've been watching the stream for 6 years and I love it

i want to be able to use the xbox one
You can't go up to a park without a park
@Jerma985 can you do a face cam joke for the rest of the stream?
I think you need to be careful with the ball, it can get stuck in the ceiling
you have to be in the car at the end
so is this a joke or is it real
@Jerma985 You can make your own sounds with the soundboard
Jerma, I'm a doctor. I recommend you to the doctor
guys, i thought this was a weirdo
@Jerma985 You can shoot the second person to the right, they get in the way

you can't go into the first room, it's locked
@Jerma985 you have to go back to the left
@Jerma985 the old lady would be terrified if you kissed her
If you use the gun it stops you from getting hit
@Jerma985 no, if it gets in a body bag it can't be recovered
@Jerma985 You can't just put a bunch of people together and call it a day

you can see the reflection of the gun in the bottom left
@Jerma985 can you get a custom jup please?
@Jerma985 you gotta play as the enemy in this game
this is literally the only way to kill him
You can't just be a fan of the show

i dont think its a bad idea
jerma i'm gonna have to pay for you to read this
I'm the color of my skin, Jerma is my color
what if jerma is actually a robot? monkaS
I think the game just wants you to go outside
@Jerma985 you should have picked the first one
@Jerma985 It's your fault for not checking the "Darkwood" one.
jerma is an asshole, he has been in this chat for like 5 hours
jerma you need to get more money for your loan
@Jerma985 why are you not wearing a vest?
theres an old video of you doing a funny voice
@Jerma985 I think you're gonna get shot by a lightning bolt in this game
you can't make a noise if you don't have a microphone
dont listen to the "this is a good game" meme
How are you doing this, the game is actually rigged
The ripper is gonna get shot by a gun
@Jerma985 What do you think the definition of insanity is?
i just joined the stream what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 have you played any game besides the first one
@Jerma985 is this game just a ripoff of the first game?
@Jerma985 how did you get a gamecube controller?
The drawstrings of my pants just flopped directly into a urinal. Wtf do I even do now? I’ve been walking around like I’m wearing a diaper cause I don’t want them to touch me.
i cant believe you just fucking killed me
"It's not my fault" - jerma, 2019
@Jerma985 you can't take a picture without a camera
@Jerma985 you're gonna make it to the end
jerma's a fucking weirdo, you need to learn to talk to him
This is like the first time i've ever heard him say that
jerma you need to play the dreamcast game
what does he want to be a part of?
@Jerma985 It's not your fault, it's not a bad idea
I just got here. Is he still doing this?
I think it's just a bhop. It's not a bhop.
this is the worst game of all time
Can you tell me the last time you ate a hotdog?
the only people that made this game were me
@Jerma985 if you don't beat the game you're not a real gamer
You can't beat this boss without the boots
How many times have you been late? LUL
you need to stop the laughter you're not funny
Jerma, you've been doing this for 6 hours
I'm sorry you got to this part
why is there a katana in this game
@Jerma985 I thought you were just joking, you're actually a great streamer, but you've been late
@Jerma985 you should do an online tutorial so we can learn from you
@Jerma985 I don't think you can handle this game
@Jerma985 I know how you feel, but I didn't expect it to be this bad
i want to go to the carnival, but i have to wait
@Jerma985 I heard you're going to be on the second season of this game
Jerma, the game is rigged, the developers are actually going to ruin this game
you are the first person to make this noise
the game is rigged, the developers are actually going to ruin this game
I think this is a joke. I'm not sure I'm paying attention
Jerma is going to get his ass kicked by this chat
I think you should do a ghost level
i dont think i can do this without the boots
@Jerma985 you have to make the ladders to the side to be able to climb the ladder
I think we're gonna see Jerma become a mod for this stream
just got back from the stream and he's still playing
@Jerma985 when you go back you get a buff
@Jerma985 What if you were a full-time streamer
@Jerma985 they don't want to see you because of your massive ego
i was gone for like 10 minutes and he's still doing this LUL
how long has he been on this level?
@Jerma985 this is the one where you get the boots
@Jerma985 Did you get to the end of the game?

I can't wait until the streamer gets his own personal account
jerma you should play the other game, we are all gonna have to be quiet to you
@Jerma985 You can't tell me what to do
you can't just put a facecam on the whole screen
@Jerma985 you should try that one if you're not a big fan of the game.
i wonder what he'll be doing in the next couple hours
@Jerma985 Hey I can't wait for the Jerma Rumble!
I have a clip of you in the shower
I think Jerma is using his social media channel as an excuse to not talk to us
the guy that streams this game is a dev
I thought this was a bit of a joke
@Jerma985 You have to do the test, you can't just do it at the end
I think it's just the jermaOneguy emote
I love how Jerma doesn't realize that he's just a chat member
@Jerma985 can you imagine if you're just running in the park and you can't see the road
@Jerma985 just use the toilet you can throw it
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS TAKING A PUNCH TO HIS BACK
That's the only thing that matters. You can't just put a face cam on the floor.
@Jerma985 what is this, the old man stream?
@Jerma985 YOU CAN MAKE A PASTA CHAINSAW THAT TOOK US
that's the worst of all worlds for that type of thing
@Jerma985 you have to finish the tutorial first
@Jerma985 do you eat meat or what?
@Jerma985 Why are you doing this to us
Why is there a "Are you playing this game or not" button on your keyboard
That's how you know it's not a boomer game
he's not gonna do it, he's not gonna beat the game
its not a prison, its a prison with a pizza
I love this game, I'm a fan of it
i wanna be the kid that gets a free candy bar
Jerma please turn off the music so we can hear the video again
@Jerma985 I need to go to sleep, wake me up when you start
Jerma, what if you just don't know the game?
this is the part where you are the guy
If you're a good person, you're not a good person
I thought you were going to do a cooking stream
I'm glad I'm not the only one that's getting this
@Jerma985 you got some "Darn" to spare
You can't make the first level of this level in a game you never played
@Jerma985 please stop playing this game, it's making my day
@Jerma985 you know he's gonna go in there and just say "me" and be like "wtf"
jermaWalk i gotta go to work tomorrow. I’ll be live by 8am
YOU'RE IN CHAT RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE STILL PLAYING THE GAME
I don't think this is the right time
@Jerma985 The real ending is to beat the game
@Jerma985 There is a shortcut in the first level.
I think he's still going to be playing this game
this is like the first time you've ever said "I'm not gonna do this"
@Jerma985 please just make a custom pinwheel please :)
@Jerma985 if you didn't watch the last one you'd have been watching the first
@Jerma985 You can buy more backpacks, but they're expensive
If you keep doing this it's gonna be a long stream
He's going to die to the second boss
It's just like the arcade game with the money
why does this game have the level of difficulty
@Jerma985 There are 12 more missions in the game
@Jerma985 you gotta make your own 3rd party software
@Jerma985 i think this is how you learn how to play
@Jerma985 it's just that you can't give it to her
oh my god im so confused what the fuck
i was watching the stream and i missed it
I've been watching your stream since like 2017
jermaSour When you're not streaming. I'm just watching this stream
====================
I don't want to see a bunch of people die
@Jerma985 I like how you are like the scrooge McDuck of video games
I like how the voice acting is so much better than the voice acting in this game
jerma stop buying stuff just for the money you have
jermaWalk JERMA HAS TO DO THE VODS IN 3 MINUTES jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you look like a half-assed janitor
@Jerma985 Do you know what a test tube is?
You can just hold it and use it as a sword
@Jerma985 I think you need to do more of the rumble
it's a bit hard to get to the end of the game
@Jerma985 The game is just a commercial for the show
I know it's a good idea, but I don't think it's the right idea
he looks like a fucking baby and he can't move
@Jerma985 What if the cow actually dies in the first place
@Jerma985 you need to kill them first then heal them
It's like the show's over and you're just about to die
I don't think the stream has enough content
@Jerma985 you have to get it to work
@Jerma985 I'm just kidding, you don't have to do it
you can't leave the house without being searched
I can't believe Jerma is actually playing this game
@Jerma985 Play the level with all the mods
I didn't get a notification on my phone jermaPluto
@Jerma985 How long has your stay in vegas been?
oh god this game is so close to being a fever dream
You can't let the ant go to heaven
This is the streamer that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 just go to the end of the level
@Jerma985 You are the best streamer, I love you
This is the worst stream I have ever seen
The people who hate this game are the most disgusting.
@Jerma985 the other two are just better than you

====================
@Jerma985 it's an easter egg, it's a black hole
Jerma I'm gonna be honest I don't know what you mean
@Jerma985 you can see the fucking thing in the bottom right
Jerma this game is too good, you are playing it wrong
is that what you think of your life
I'm glad I didn't have to watch the whole stream.
@Jerma985 you can see the zit on the ground
I hope he plays this one more time
i am happy with my life for the first time

@Jerma985 when you get a free shot, do the drawstring challenge
@Jerma985 You can just hold and hold for a few seconds to get better reaction times
@Jerma985 What if I want to go to a stream but my internet is bad?
@Jerma985 I think you can see where it is by looking at the world map
i would watch a straightedge streamer who's chat is watching
@Jerma985 hey can you imagine if you had a massive ass?
jerma is just a fat kid with a big dick

jermaWalk I DONT WANT TO BE OUTTA HERE jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you need to put your face in the window
The other game is the one you're playing

@Jerma985 you can make the helmet into a face
@Jerma985 you can put a flower in the top of the main shaft
@Jerma985 You can't get a tax refund on the fake one
@Jerma985 THE WATER SHUT THE FUCK UP
@Jerma985 I know you are a big fan of mine, but the movie is too dark
hey jerma can you start the stream while i go to bed
hey jerma, if youre reading this, you have been playing this game for 6 hours straight and have been in the same spot for 3 hours straight. We are very sorry for any upset you may have caused.
This is like when you talk to a friend for the first time
@Jerma985 i think you're still reading the poll
This is the most boring game I've ever seen.
Why does this guy have so many fucking jokes?
@Jerma985 There are no water controls in this game
jermaPluto I don't think he's gonna be able to hear us
jermaOtto "When you turn the stream off, I can't hear you"
@Jerma985 This is actually the worst game I've ever watched.

they are gonna have to stop you after you stop
I just realized the game is the real game
I'm sorry Jerma, but I think you're having a bad day
@Jerma985 You can use the fire extinguisher on a fire extinguisher
Jerma I'm coming to the party, can you put on your clothes?
this is the most political stream
====================
The game is a game of chance, you don't need to gamble with your money
@Jerma985 it's almost as if you're trying to stop the stream
@Jerma985 use your switch to find the middle one
@Jerma985 you have to get in the middle of the road
dude how long has he been playing this?
You can tell jerma is trying to be funny
@Jerma985 you need to have an archer on the ground
@Jerma985 you can get the poop and you can sell it
The whole point of this game is to make you think of everything else
i just got back from a long day at work
I thought it was a bird but it was a fish
What is this the streamer that hasn't gotten a new gun yet?
i have like 10k points and i have to leave immediately
I love how Jerma is doing the same exact thing every stream
can you do a jup in the middle of the stream?
what the fuck is happening, i just got here
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO TURN DOWN THE SCREEN TO THE END

@Jerma985 can we get a new emote for this one?
cheer250 you did this to my mom, what a fucking fuck you
I think you need to make sure you're not streaming early
I'm going to have to do it, can you give me a sub?
@Jerma985 Don't forget to set the leash on your own!
I can't wait to see the stream of the chibik!
why is the r9k on the back of the screen?
jerma, i'm gonna be honest, I can't tell if you're joking or not. I have to listen to this man
jermaPluto He's gonna forget to feed his dog
I need to watch the new Jerma vids
Jerma please turn down the stream to prevent a seizure, i am in the hospital and can't watch any of your streams anymore
theres no way i can pay for your internet bills
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this game?

@Jerma985 the best part of the game is that you can play the game at any time
@Jerma985 How many times do you think you'll do a stream where you play as a woman?
You're not going to be able to make a good impression if you don't have a good idea
how do you still get this frog? LUL
i think it was to have the goat throw something
@Jerma985 you are a god gamer, this is your fault
You got your boomer brace on at the end
Jerma is a clown, he can't take a shit
I bet you don't know how to play the game
i can't believe this streamer is playing a game he hates
@Jerma985 Please make a new Jerma vid for every stream
Jerma you've been doing this for 3 years now
we are just watching this stream with you :)
I think it's because of the fact that it's a low-poly game
@Jerma985 if you do that you're not supposed to be there
@Jerma985 you can also use the special move from the main menu
hey guys i got some lemons, thanks :)
@Jerma985 If you're playing on the PS4 Pro you can play it on PC
@Jerma985 you have to put the disc in the controller, you can't just play the game over
@Jerma985 you need to be in the wrong place at the wrong time

I'm gonna go get a drink and go to the bathroom
Jerma can you change the music for this
jermaWalk I'm gonna go to bed, hope you have a good night
this guy sounds like a kid from a old movie
@Jerma985 There's a lot of room for error here

@Jerma985 do you think youll ever play the new game?
@Jerma985 it's not, it's just a clip of you saying "yo"

This is the worst Jerma stream ever.

i dont think this is going to be as good as the one with the real ending
I'm on the last game of the game, I'm not even in the endgame
@Jerma985 What if you can't pick up the bar in the cave?
Just add a few more in the middle

Jerma I'm not gonna say the stream title and it's not gonna be the same
i thought that was the new blood color
you have to get to the top of the tower
I'd love to see Jerma make an animal crossing video, but I'm too lazy and dumb to do it jermaPluto

"i'm in a room" sounds like a real episode of jermacraft
i like how jerma's voice is really low
@Jerma985 play the music video for the song

just like you said it would be a good idea

@Jerma985 YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME
@Jerma985 im glad youre playing this game :)
jerma's going to start at 12AM, we are going to get this message in a while
It's been a while since I've had a good time. I think you're doing really well.
@Jerma985 i saw this on youtube and i thought you were a short person, sorry I didnt notice
the earth is a sphere, so you have to be the center of the earth to see it
Oh god I'm not going to play this anymore
How do I tell if it's a joke or not?
i cant even tell what is happening with this stream
@Jerma985 do a facecam for the rest of the stream
@Jerma985 what's with the person on the left?
@Jerma985 You have to do the 'I'm not your friend' joke again.
@Jerma985 You need to give him a free ticket
imagine if you had a phone that could answer your call
@Jerma985 Go to the bathroom and open the door to get out
you're not supposed to take the money though
you're gonna get a rat infested bowling alley
I'm sorry I couldn't make the joke
@Jerma985 What's the most you can say about the "Jerma" meme?
the world is a giant and there's no one there to help
It's a sadistic murder spree that goes on for hours
@Jerma985 I just got back from work and you're still playing this?
jerma is the same person who said it's a bad idea to remove the word "jerma"
he has to be on time because he has to pee
@Jerma985 are you going to do a funeral for this guy
@Jerma985 There's a bullet that is in the game
The music is pretty bad. I just got here and I feel like I'm listening to the song.
@Jerma985 you know how to make a bad joke
@Jerma985 youre gonna have to use the ladder
@Jerma985 do you like to chew? I know you can chew a lot but that's not a bad thing
@Jerma985 please be careful on the controller, it could be plugged in and you could fall over
@Jerma985 you should do the "I'm not your friend" joke, you're gonna lose some viewers
@Jerma985 What's your favorite germanic country? I like the Czech Republic and it's a very good country
The real funny part of this game is the crazy taxi
"The earth is a sphere, so you have to be the center of the earth"
@Jerma985 You need to turn on the eye cam
@Jerma985 get your money out of the machine
@Jerma985 do you have a million dollars?
@Jerma985 you need to tell the joke now
I can't believe Jerma is still playing this
@Jerma985 when are you going to do the jermacraft stream?
@Jerma985 You are going to get a heart attack
Jerma you're going to have to wait for another hour for this one
@Jerma985 if you hit the boulder, you can get the item for the item
@Jerma985 you're gonna need to go to the german border town

====================
Jeremy, please don't go in the toilet. It will get in the way.
The thing is that the game is a little too slow for you
how can you be a cop if you're a bad cop
@Jerma985 what's the deal with a real green egg
@Jerma985 he's too good at this game, he's so stupid
@Jerma985 Put it in the wall and then put the other one in
This game is a fucking nightmare. It's like watching an old man play this game.
@Jerma985 im not going to get the link i dont want to be able to hear it
Jerma, are you going to play the new Pokemon games?
@Jerma985 Do you have a Wii in the bathroom?
@Jerma985 It's a joke you can't hide it
@Jerma985 I think you should be done with the game
Jerma is a bit too much of a coward to be nice to the chat
I'm not even going to put the name of the game on the list, I'm just here for the vod :)
do you think he will do a co-op stream with ster?
@Jerma985 You can just play the game in the background
how many times has he been about to say he hates this game?
@Jerma985 i'm gonna get you a huge cup of coffee
@Jerma985 if you buy a whole bottle of wine you can get it on the phone
It's a "hey Jeremy" or "hey guys" emote
i cant believe he has a gun
@Jerma985 go to the house next to the barricade
what if you cant afford a house?
I don't think you can eat ass you are a duck
I know how to play that game, but I don't know how to play the game for the love of god
why is there a message in chat about this
@Jerma985 if you do a tutorial, you should do it on stream
I wish I could be as smart as Jerma
Jerma's gonna get a couple more rants for this
@Jerma985 You should be a part of the quarantine
that's a lot of money to be made in this time
the wind is in the air, it's not in the water
i cant wait for the 2nd jerma video
@Jerma985 you've already beat the game, you can do this.
@Jerma985 im gonna be the one to send you the link
I just got here, what is he doing?
@Jerma985 just a reminder that the last time you said "do this" you said "don't do this"
jermaPluto i would never do this to my body
@Jerma985 you need to get the meat off of the head first
I like how he doesn't know what the game is
@Jerma985 Do you think you'll play Half-Life Alyx?
i'm gonna go back to the main menu
@Jerma985 i think you need to do a sekiro stream
@Jerma985 There's a dog in the water. It's a dog
I just got here and I thought it was a fucking robot
this is like a 10 hour scene from the movies
@Jerma985 You have to get a sub to get a sub
@Jerma985 dont worry its a good game so you'll get it
You can't cheat, it's a trap, not a game
@Jerma985 You arent supposed to put the food in the oven
@Jerma985 are you sure you have an issue with your elbow?
@Jerma985 go back to the beginning of the level
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Sunday. Around 3-4pm PST!
if you get that many pogs, you get a bounty
what if we kissed in the bathroom :)
This game is a weirdly happy game
@Jerma985 I just got here, what is this guy playing?
@Jerma985 just go through the same thing over and over again
what if you did that and you were a kid
It's like when you're in a doctor's office
this is the most fucked thing ive ever seen
@Jerma985 can you get me to the rat movie?
i have no idea what it is but i can tell it's a shitty movie
@Jerma985 can you give us a link to the game?
@Jerma985 if you did that you would have to be dead
Jerma, you should play a new game in the next hour.
@Jerma985 You can turn on the webcam to see how much the game is
@Jerma985 you can put the code on the ticket
JERMA WHATS THE POINT OF A HUMAN TRAIN
A Yakuza was pretty good, but I'd rather watch a game about a kid and his dog.
@Jerma985 Please get rid of the dog, it's hurting my eyes and nose
@Jerma985 you just gave us a bunch of money
You're gonna get your hand in the trough
This game is the first time I've ever seen someone say that.
@Jerma985 there are no more heroes 2, no more heroes 3, and no more heroes 4
The black bars are the medics in the lower left
Jerma you can't keep saying the same thing over and over
I can't believe Jerma is in the next Jerma Rumble
@Jerma985 That is a lot of people, i just got here and he is already dead
The more you say the more people will vote
jerma has been in a coma for 9 years
This is the game that is going to have you screaming at the end
I’ve never heard of that streamer that got banned for being a liar
jerma is a super gamer he can do ANYTHING
I'm glad you're here. I hope you're having a good day.
jermaOld I'm a gamer and I love this game
@Jerma985 Hey jerma, how's it going? I'm here, but it's been a while since I've seen you stream
@Jerma985 That's not how the game works.
@Jerma985 If you do the same thing over and over again, you'll get a different result.
hey guys can someone please tell me what the hell is going on
Jerma, you're going to get banned. The mods are going to have to ban you for doing that.
you have to wait for the next emote
you need to do a better job than this
you don't need to do it it's the only way to get it
i hope jerma is having a good day
Jerma, you're the best at this game, you're right
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the big streamer PepeHands
my favorite game is the minecraft one :)
@Jerma985 YOU CAN USE THE WINDOWS QUEUE FOR REWRITING
i want to see jerma play games from the past
@Jerma985 do you have any idea what's in the game
why is it a child? it's the kid who was killed
i wonder if jerma is going to make it to the next season
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't seen the movie yet
I think that's the most common type of spillage, and that's why they're all like "I'm gonna dump it all in the toilet"
@Jerma985 hey jerma can you please stop talking about how fucking boring this game is for you, it's like watching someone watch a movie and not having the opportunity to enjoy it
@Jerma985 You can give your guild members weapons, but you can't give them weapons.
@Jerma985 Are you still going to play my game?
@Jerma985 I think you can use the door as a shortcut to the left
jermaWalk IM GOING TO TURN OFF MY TV jermaWalk
no more heroes 2 is the best game ever made
Jerma is a hell of a gamer, he can do ANYTHING
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this? You’re gonna get banned
@Jerma985 your monster has a head like the rest of us
i had to go back to my room, and i thought this was a good idea
they say you have to jump down to the bottom
@Jerma985 I don't know what this is but this is the funniest joke I've ever heard
Boys will be boys when he gets to the next area
i will never be able to sleep to this
@Jerma985 I made this, the game I'm playing right now, and it's called Lifeline
I have no idea what the fuck is happening
I'm glad I didn't miss that one jermaHeart
JERMA IS A BIG DICK BUT YOU ARE THE BIG DICK
you're not supposed to have a dog but you are the dog
@Jerma985 you can get a mod that lets you make a better character
@Jerma985 if you kill the snake, they'll come out of the water
@Jerma985 the game doesn't make you anything but a boomer
I thought it was a good idea but I'm not sure it was worth the effort
I've never seen someone say that in my entire life
jerma is a big gamer and he can do ANYTHING
The best part of this game is that you can throw stuff up and kill people
@Jerma985 YOU CAN STARE DOWN TO THE LEFT
IT'S NOT A CHAT NO I'M A COW
I just got here and I can't stop shitting
@Jerma985 you have to buy more potions for him
guys, he's playing as the priest in this game
@Jerma985 please do a stream where you don't talk to us about our lives and how we feel
i think the people who play this game are just scared
It's like the first thing you do when you get the boots
YOU DIDN'T GET THE LEFT ONE AFTER YOU LOST IT
@Jerma985 I'm so glad you're playing this game. It's the best.
Jerma can you move to the front of the boat?
I hope he can't get to the island
@Jerma985 I thought you were gonna get a new one
I think they were meant to be with you
jermaWalk I'M GETTING RID OF MY BRAIN IN THE AUDIO
@Jerma985 Can you do a stream of you just eating ass?
i'm the guy who did the voice for this game and i can tell you that i have a very high tolerance for chunky food
jermaOld how do you feel about the face cam
I need to see the full stream archive
I remember when this was a burger king stream
he's been telling us to stop for a while jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you have to do the second mission first
@Jerma985 You could have just done a full playthrough
you can't do the first part, you can't even do the second part
I wonder if jerma would be able to beat the boss without dying to pinwheel
@Jerma985 will you be able to get the boots?
@Jerma985 the rest of this game is just a vr game
You know what? You're gonna have to start over.
@Jerma985 i'm gonna be right back you're still here
@Jerma985 please play the game that isnt the best
@Jerma985 this is the guy that died to pinwheel
@Jerma985 I think you need to throw a rock
i love how the stream is just one guy
I think you need to use the rock for the chains
@Jerma985 What's the name of the game?
@Jerma985 you can see the fan with the heart
@Jerma985 YOU DIDNT GET THE LEFT ONE AFTER YOU LOST IT
It's a joke, but you're right :)
It's a good game for a great game
@Jerma985 You can stop it by clicking the buttons, you have to keep the stick in place
@Jerma985 You don't have to talk to us. Just talk to us.
@Jerma985 The next movie will be a fucking vampire
i dont think its that hard for jerma
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the new Dragon's Dogma DLC?
@Jerma985 if you're playing this you're a fool
why is the main character an adult in the first place
@Jerma985 Use the money to buy new weapons
Jerma is a boomer, he doesn't know how to play games.
If you want to be the best, you have to beat the game
@Jerma985 why does the boss sound like a voice changer
@Jerma985 You can't use the coin as a weapon
@Jerma985 are you doing a "The Thing" stream?
@Jerma985 I like the guy, but I can't help but laugh
you need to turn the game off at the same time to see how much it hurts
I don't think the first one was a good idea
I'm gonna go to the doctor now jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can use the chainsaw to chop off limbs
The movie was about a ghost, not a boomer
@Jerma985 are you gonna play the entire thing again?
@Jerma985 you can do a lot more with the wings
This is the worst job I've ever seen.
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the boots from the first boss
"Haha" - Jerma laughs at joke - "You're right"
@Jerma985 i'm just a poor old man and i don't know anything about this game
jermaVenus we're not even close to the game
@Jerma985 It's because the aliens are talking to the humans, so the people are either angry or angry
I've never seen a streamer play this game
@Jerma985 if you're not playing it right now, you're missing out on the fun
@Jerma985 why would you need to be in the first place
jerma's just a boomer, he doesn't know how to play games
GabeN what do you think of the new monster rancher
@Jerma985 get your arms out so you can take damage
@Jerma985 This is like a joke you are trying to make
this is the game where you have to be a god
can we get a live stream of the entirety of the movie
I thought this was a space channel 5 stream
JERMA YOU'RE MAKING MY WIFE HURRY THE FIRE
@Jerma985 Why does the other guy's voice sound like you?
I think the music is just too much for the game
@Jerma985 can you do the funny voice again?
@Jerma985 you have to make a decent score, I think
I am so sad that Jerma is gone :(
@Jerma985 can you turn off the music please
why do you have so many people watching in silence
@Jerma985 What if it was a game where you were an alien?
@Jerma985 you cant sell the dogs, they are fucking stolen
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this in the first place?
jerma you're gonna lose your mind if you don't play more
you need to turn off the game audio so we can listen to your voice
@Jerma985 they were talking about the dragon tbh
the one with the gun is just a bear
@Jerma985 the freddie deen song is one of my favorite songs
@Jerma985 I have no idea what you're talking about, but I think you should play some of the other games on stream.
@Jerma985 You can't play the game as a kid, that's how they're supposed to play it
@Jerma985 just play the first episode of monster hunter and I will be happy
how many times has he said it
I wonder if he'll ever play a game where you can spam the command
imagine not using the fish as a weapon
my cat is a fucking zombie what the fuck is wrong with her
DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A TRAFFIC GAME
theres a lot of money to be made here
Just wait until you find the secret in the key room
jermaSour when you need to cry, but then cry out for help
@Jerma985 You should be able to walk into the door
@Jerma985 You gotta pay for the extra money, like a cashier
you have to shoot the guy who can't kill you
Why are you using the same soundboard for a fucking elevator?
@Jerma985 You can't just go on a rampage and kill everyone
how can you be so bad at this game
@Jerma985 Do you know how to play?
jerma you can't be in the chat right now
I thought that was the guy who beat dark souls 3 on stream
i bet you cant even beat a game
@Jerma985 you are a true gamer and you would be a true gamer

This is the music of the cyberpunk decade

@Jerma985 have you ever heard the call of duty theme

@Jerma985 I just got back from work and he is still playing this game?
jerma is a full-time streamer now but he's doing some work in the field
@Jerma985 you can get the secret in the key room
@Jerma985 Are you going to play a game you're never playing?
@Jerma985 You can use the hammer to move the other way
I thought this was a reference to the Lord of the Rings trilogy
Jerma's a creep and he doesn't know what a cawfee is
it was only for 2 weeks, you're not going to get it
I think this is the exact scene where they were all the same person
@Jerma985 If you die, you can't be in the pool
@Jerma985 you can do the same thing but it's a really hard difficulty
All those dreams of being a 10 year old.
I'm gonna buy a shitload of crack jermaPluto
Jerma you're not gonna be able to complete this mission
The problem is that they're all new.
just get some water to drink and you'll be fine
Hey guys I'm back, what the fuck is going on?

@Jerma985 if you have to pay for a ride you can just walk it through your house
@Jerma985 can you show your facecam please :)
why is everyone in this game so rude
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that beat pinwheel?

@Jerma985 You're still a kid. You can play as many as you want.
I love this song, its so cute, just feel like you're playing this game
Says the guy who just lost his life
@Jerma985 go to the left side of the screen
@Jerma985 what did you do to your head?

YOU HAVE TO TURN ON SOUNDTRACK AND PLAY THE GAME
@Jerma985 you need to do some more work on the platform
@Jerma985 PLEASE REMEMBER TO GIVE HIM THE TOILET
I can't believe Jerma lied about being a short person
I'm gonna start this stream with a joke about "I'm in the shower"
If you die in the game you die in real life
Jerma, you have a lot of experience with the Wii
What do you do with the money? Or what do you do with it?
he's still on the end of the card

Chat you have to put it on the ground
the way he's dressed is the perfect image of jerma
I thought you were doing the double chin
@Jerma985 You should do a podcast about how the game is pretty fun to watch
its not the game, you're just a liar LUL
you were really trying to make it to the end
@Jerma985 The game was really good for this.
do you think Jerma will stream the entirety of the Dark Souls series?
jerma is the kind of person to not tell the truth
This is the streamer that can't be funny
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting on Sunday. Around 3-4pm PST!

@Jerma985 How can you play this game with so many people?
@Jerma985 You can buy the jacket if you die in the game
I'm actually not sure if I'm watching the stream or not, but it sounds like this is a part of the game
theres no way that it's the exact same thing
@Jerma985 i wanna see your reaction to the TOWN
@Jerma985 the world record for most consecutive days in a stream is 5 hours, and you've been streaming that for 6 days
@Jerma985 I think it's more likely to be a rare event than a normal one
this is the first time i've seen a person in chat talking about it in a real way
why would you make it out of the gate
what happened to the jermaSour? i thought he was on the toilet
I'd love to see you play a game
@Jerma985 if you're an artist, put a picture of your face on the wall
Dont forget to get the chainlink fence you can get a bit of a fence

i cant believe jerma doesnt know about the word "bunch"
dont go to the hospital, go to the hospital
Jerma you're playing a game for children that doesn't have the same feel as it does.
This is the longest one ive ever laughed. This is what I've been hearing.
He has a lot of money, he can afford it
@Jerma985 you have to give him a surprise gift
I think the only way to go is to build more
you have to start the stream from the beginning
I'm sure it's not like you're a liar
@Jerma985 this is just a background noise, you're not even in the game
jermaOneguy jermaOneguy This is your favorite streamer, don't worry. :)
Jerma, you're supposed to make the entire world a better place.
@Jerma985 do you think you could beat dark souls on stream?
this game looks like it's from the 90s
@Jerma985 is this just a quick joke? LUL
You don't have to throw the ball on him
you can just do it again if you have the time
@Jerma985 Make a small childrens book about a frog
@Jerma985 you're going to make an excuse for it later

I remember when this was a horror game, I remember
I think the mods should be the ones to make sure the game is clean.
I was watching the stream, what is this streamer doing?
@Jerma985 Have you seen the new Animal Crossing?
@Jerma985 you should do a background noise to prove it
you can use the mouse to go down
I'm sure you can at least do it one more time

I'm going to go to the bathroom and give you a hug
@Jerma985 you're not supposed to have to be a jerma, you're supposed to be a peepoHappy

@Jerma985 you can't just keep doing this for 5 minutes
He sounds like he's trying to be serious
I have a birthday tomorrow and I'm going to be watching you
I would love to see a Jerma stream where he's a single-handedly ruining a stream
i think this game is gonna be a lot more interesting than the games he's playing
@Jerma985 please stop this is so sad jermaPluto
You need to have a strategy of constantly avoiding traps
@Jerma985 the stream is live, i'm watching in the background
@Jerma985 dont do it, dont lie. youre bad at this game
You should try and get a new camera for the old one

jermaDisgust This is the type of streamer that thinks that there are no choices
i cant believe they are playing this game

@Jerma985 The less you talk the better
jermaOld is that a new age or something
@Jerma985 what do you think you can get for a dollar?
jerma you can play the game for like 8 hours
jerma you have to stop the stream and play the game :)
just do a full playthrough of the game and be honest with yourself
there are way too many buttons in this game
I was going to do the same thing but I'm having trouble
@Jerma985 what happened to the girl you ate a shoe?
what a psycho streamer. I just want to watch the stream :)
I am so glad I missed the stream
jermaPluto can't be me, I'm a fucking psycho
i cant believe he's still playing this
Jerma is the one who makes all of the rules
he's gonna make the next game with a fucking dildo
Jerma985 is a liar, he hasnt even seen the bottom of the screen
@Jerma985 This game was made in the 90s and you can't tell me it was made in the 90s
Can we get a streamer of this game for stream tonight?

@Jerma985 Don't be mean to the cow, its not her fault
This is why I don't like this game
@Jerma985 are you going to play nancy drew?
the fucking idiot streamer is gonna make it to the next level
I don't think there's a difference between the two
@Jerma985 You can get a new controller, it's in the menu
I'm here to make fun of Jerma's height
this is the most you can do jerma
Jerma, you should go to the doctor, he's really bad
Your character looks like a god gamer
I just got here, what the fuck is going on?
@Jerma985 you can now play the OST
@Jerma985 just try to keep your character strong
@Jerma985 They are pretty obvious, but the point is to make them not, and to not be a distraction
i can't believe they are doing this to us
@Jerma985 the snow is too hard, you can't get past the walls
@Jerma985 use the high pitched whistle to make a sound
@Jerma985 I'm gonna get this level, I can't wait to play it :)
@Jerma985 Play the Fishing Planet music from this level
@Jerma985 it looks like a meat grinder for your desk
I think the real reason why Jerma is so mad is because he doesnt know what the hell is going on
@Jerma985 If you're good at something never do it for free
Jerma is gonna get stuck on this for the next 5 hours
@Jerma985 Put your facecam on the right side
@Jerma985 You're a good boy, you should have taken the other one @Jerma985
This is what happens when you don't talk to the people you're trying to kill
@Jerma985 you've got to do the best one
@Jerma985 you can go to the secret rooms and make some upgrades
you could have put your face on the ice
I'm not sure I can have this much time in one game
I can't wait to see him get his fucking facecam
@Jerma985 make your own bean bagel and throw it into the ocean
YOU CAN ONLY BEAT IT ON THE FIRST LEVEL
@Jerma985 There are only 5 days left on the game
@Jerma985 You can use the fish as a healing item
@Jerma985 It's like that one episode of The Office
@Jerma985 The other one is the REAL one
How can I be in the minecraft server if I'm not a boomer?
@Jerma985 Jerma, please do a full playthrough of this game, its not too hard
LUL you can't even tell if it's a full playthrough or not
@Jerma985 the other one is the REAL one
I can't believe Jerma is so angry at this game
@Jerma985 If you're good at something never do it for free
He's gonna miss out on the cutscene by not playing the game
I love how Jerma is like, like, "this is what I got for Christmas"
why do you have to be so mad about a thing
@Jerma985 You can use the lightning bolt to make a small room in the first level
The game is about to end, what the hell
SourPls I WAS HERE FOR THE FIVE MINUTES SourPls
jermaWalk I NEED TO GET BACK TO MY HOUSE
@Jerma985 You can't get a new house unless you have the money
@Jerma985 It's not a terrible idea, it's just really stupid
I think they're doing the first part of the game
he's gonna have to get a new house jermaPluto
you could be a little less out of touch
@Jerma985 Do you think the first person version of this game was really good?
I can't believe I'm watching Jerma's stream right now
@Jerma985 when are you going to play the gamecube gamecube game?
@Jerma985 This is the first time I've heard this message in a stream, I've been here for a while and it makes me want to vomit
@Jerma985 When are you going to play the new Mario Maker 2?
@Jerma985 This is a 12 hour stream, just for the fun of it
there's a cool thing you can do with a simple shit name
jermaOld i remember when he would only talk about his pee
@Jerma985 you can sell the fish to a merchant, they'll be happy
@Jerma985 I need to know if you know what a meme is
@Jerma985 this is the only way to get the video
I hope he doesn't get a new house
jermaOld i can't be in the chat anymore
@Jerma985 you've already made it to the other two levels
@Jerma985 You need to tell the joke so it makes sense
@Jerma985 I'm from the UK, what are you talking about?
no joke, it was you that made the video
Chat has Bashed 13 Seagulls, use !bash to help
I'm gonna be sad when he never plays it
hey jerma, why are you making me laugh like a little girl?
The enemies are your friends, just like you
@Jerma985 you're going to get the worst ending
i'm gonna be honest, the new room is pretty cool
the fact that you dont know how to use the buttons is really fucked up
The key is in the controller you IDIOT
I can't believe you're playing the game wrong
YOU CAN TURN THE CAM ON AND OFF WITH A BACKUP
I can't believe Jerma is a robot LUL
jermaWalk I MADE MY OWN SHIT jermaWalk jermaWalk
i love how jerma's current humor is a bit too long
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaWalk jermaWalk jermaWalk jermaWalk jermaWalk

theres a boss fight in the middle of this game
You're like the only person I watch jermaPluto
If you can't read the book, you're a loser
@Jerma985 I have a question for you, do you have a new laptop?
@Jerma985 You're the only person I watch jermaPluto
The first boss is really easy for you
He's going to get the 985, right? LUL
This is the only stream I can catch and the first one is a bit.
@Jerma985 it's the bad one, the other one is the good one
@Jerma985 It's on the xbox and it's like a lot more expensive than the regular one
@Jerma985 you have to do a certain amount of jumps, it's not good for your health
Why do you have a spooky voice @Jerma985
the idea is that your dick is a casket
@Jerma985 you have to do the whole level before you can get a job
@Jerma985 Can you do a bit message in the chat?
@Jerma985 you have to go back to the beginning
@Jerma985 What do you think of the new Monster Rancher 2?
i don't think i've ever seen that joke
is it just me or is the music so loud
@Jerma985 You can turn the audio up if you're a bit louder
i love the 'he said he'll play it'
the red dead 2 music is way better than this one
"You can't do that" - Jerma985 jermaPluto
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this game?
Oh my god the fucking screen looks like it's from a different game

Is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel on stream?
@Jerma985 i think you need to go to the top

@Jerma985 I am a good friend and you should be able to see my emails

the one where the players are the heros
It's a secret mission, it's not a secret mission
@Jerma985 this is the last time you will be in the water
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game and not the real one
"I'm not going to play this" -Jerma985

@Jerma985 the cutscene was actually the one where the man eats the cardboard
@Jerma985 what's the best way to beat this boss
jerma is a madman and is making all of us mad
@Jerma985 It's not a hard level, it's a fun one
@Jerma985 you can make a path to the mountains and climb it
@Jerma985 remember that you can't just jump to the side
I feel like this is the best game ever made
can you please stop saying "clown" it's getting annoying
@Jerma985 It's okay, you can do it! :)
@Jerma985 you should play the Dark Souls of Diablo 2, it's one of my favorite games
Why is everyone saying it's a game about sex?
JERMA JERMA DON'T PLAY MY MOM'S PORN OR I'LL MURDER YOUR DICK
@Jerma985 You should play a game called Bloodborne, it's a dark souls game
Is this the streamer that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?

@Jerma985 Are you a fan of the movies?
@Jerma985 this is the beginning of the stream
i've been watching your stream for 4 hours and i still have no idea what is going on
@Jerma985 When you die you can't be in the game anymore
@Jerma985 this is a good stream, but not a good one
can someone explain to me why this isnt a game about a baby?
I think it's probably a good idea to do this on a different gamecube.
@Jerma985 i think you can jump when you go up
@Jerma985 can you put a picture of you on the wall?
this is the guy who beat dark souls 3 ON STREAM
jermaOld Back in my day, we didn't have to get our food

I'm watching the VOD with my mom and dad, so I'm pretty sure he'll be fine.
is this the streamer that beat Dark Souls 3?
@Jerma985 The second one is for the cow
@Jerma985 you need to give him the staff

@Jerma985 are you going to play the new game?
You're gonna be in a lot of trouble
@Jerma985 Did you ever try the gamecube version?

@Jerma985 Will you do the monkey game?
@Jerma985 you can jump over the fence to get to the ladder

A man died of old age at the age of 79

Jerma's gonna get a nice warm bath tomorrow @Jerma985
@Jerma985 It's a pretty good idea to make a custom level that can be uploaded to a channel that has a lot of bots

@Jerma985 you have to turn off the mic

@Jerma985 you can get the key by picking it up.
JERMA NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT IN THE GAME

@Jerma985 i can't believe you've done this in an hour
@Jerma985 theres a 4th floor bathroom in the middle of the movie
You should put your money in the ring of money
@Jerma985 did you ever play the RDR2 one?
I just got here, is this a joke?
@Jerma985 There's a really cool game called "Lootbox"
@Jerma985 i think you should play that with your friends :)
you are a cool dude, don't be afraid to do what you gotta do
if you have a hotdog i would love to be your friend :)
@Jerma985 What is the name of this game?
@Jerma985 you should have a button for the buttons
You’ve been on this for 5 years
chat was just trolling you for not understanding what a ferris wheel is LUL
I know what you mean. I'm too cowardly to believe you're a liar.
"I'm just doing my part to save the world"

how long has he been playing this game for?
@Jerma985 I'm just gonna say that you're a great streamer and love your content
The title is "Died to Pinwheel" and I don't think it's a reference to that
It's not a joke. It's not a joke
@Jerma985 You can shoot the lightbulbs first
JERMA THIS GAME IS TOO TALL YOU CAN SEE IT

@Jerma985 You should play the DLC for this game, it's a really fun experience and really enjoyable to watch.
he's gonna get it with the other three?
he's just gonna give up on the first part
@Jerma985 I'm the only one who can't see the words "Etalyx"
@Jerma985 I'm the only one who can see the words
@Jerma985 you're supposed to use the other one, not the one on the left
Jerma, I have a hard time believing you have a copy of the original
@Jerma985 The only thing that matters is the amount of money you have
@Jerma985 you can keep the money if you want to
he's going to be so mad at this game
Why is this game so fun to play?
@Jerma985 i want to see your butt
Just think about how the one person who makes that joke would never do that
@Jerma985 I don't know if you can even read this
Jerma is the only person who would actually go to jail for this
@Jerma985 you gotta get the credits roll first
You've been in a coma for 10 years jermaPluto

@Jerma985 You have to place the money in a bag to pay it back
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to put it in the trash.
I'm so glad to see the reaction to the new content
Jerma985, how are you doing? I don't think I'm gonna be able to watch the stream.
I'm sorry I was expecting to see a streamer that cares more about his viewers than his own
@Jerma985 You're not supposed to make a payment
I wish I had the time to catch this stream
I'm glad he has the game in the house, I think he'd enjoy it

"I'm the one who makes all of the rules"
I was so happy when the stream started
You can buy a potion from the shop.
Jerma, you can't just make up the game, it's not real
I wonder if Jerma will be able to get the boots

you're gonna get stuck in the water with the fish
@Jerma985 You can't just go back to the beginning
That's what happens when you're not around for the game.

I want to see how much money you've spent on this game

@Jerma985 That's a lot of money, you should give it to them
I mean, you have to be a professional gamer to get the boots
@Jerma985 you're the only one who doesn't want to go to the hospital
i'm watching this stream and i'm genuinely scared
@Jerma985 can we get a new emote for the channel?
@Jerma985 this is the game you were talking about
@Jerma985 It's a little harder than this, but it's still a lot better
@Jerma985 just have a streamer in the backseat, and he will be in the background

Jerma is just gonna get a big head and do a naked chin
@Jerma985 you can actually see the internet using the eye

@Jerma985 why are you putting it in the middle of the screen
Jerma, you need to get a better t-shirt
I'm a streamer and I'm here to inform you that the stream is over jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You should do a "Hey guys, how are you doing" video.
If you lose you get to play for the rest of the stream
it's like the sound of a child being tortured
He was just gonna say that he's playing the game, which is what he is
I just got here what the fuck is happening
I can't believe Jerma's just been streaming for 6 hours, we're getting a new meme jermaPluto
I don't think this is the game to be ashamed of
you can't move the body with the bow
If this is a real life experience, does he not know that the audio is going to be messed up?
Jerma please stop doing the impression of a baby, it's a simulation
@Jerma985 Why are you playing a game that isnt even made by the studio?
What kind of monster is this? I know that monster, but I'm not sure what it is.
theres a reason why they're called "cool kids"
@Jerma985 This game is like a 90s cartoon
@Jerma985 It's called the "Paintball" level, it's just the "Paintball" level
@Jerma985 You're gonna need a battery in the tank to recharge it

@Jerma985 Why is there a delay on the streamer face?
i think its the same exact thing
i don't want to talk about this shit
Why would you even want to watch this
@Jerma985 why are you so bad at this game
Jerma do you have a golf cart or something?
this is like watching a video with a doctor
Jerma is going to be late for work
jerma, you have to do the voices in the bottom right
he's gonna put on a mask and do the voice
i got a really bad headache, I can't get it out of my head

@Jerma985 What if you just got a katana sword and never used it

@Jerma985 You can go to the back of the castle
Jerma if you could never be born again, what would you do?
If you dont have a dad, I'm not gonna give you that shit
It's like a dog that's been sitting in a crate for over a week.
@Jerma985 are you going to play the new Monster Rancher 2?
@Jerma985 Are you gonna be streaming in like 2 hours?
it's not a real game, it's a baby game
@Jerma985 I'm going to the toilet and I'm gonna eat my own ass
You can't even say the same thing over and over
@Jerma985 you can put the coins in the garage
@Jerma985 I'd be happy to have a chat in the discord channel
he's not even at the start of the game
@Jerma985 I'm gonna ask you a question, what's the best ending for this game?
@Jerma985 What did you think of the new Vegas theme?
@Jerma985 do you think you can beat this game in 30 seconds?
@Jerma985 Can you stream for 2 hours? I need to watch the VOD
@Jerma985 you need to make a bigger house for the giant rat
@Jerma985 There's a guy that's in the stream and he's just too busy killing them to do it anymore
@Jerma985 they are going to get attacked by the more powerful monsters
@Jerma985 Have you ever seen someone eat a shoe and then eat it in an hour?
@Jerma985 the tutorial is just this entire game
@Jerma985 it's a game about the dangers of high risk, not a game about the dangers of playing safe
I’ll be honest, I don't really know what I'd be playing if it wasn't for the sounds and the music.
HOLY SHIT THE FUCK IS THIS MADE IN JERMA
imagine being this bad at a game LUL
@Jerma985 you can hit the shield and the knight will instantly kill them
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to leave the level to get a new one
@Jerma985 I'm going to watch the VOD soon. Please start the stream.
@Jerma985 It's the 4th phase of the game
@Jerma985 THE DUNGEON IS A SUPERHERO BUT NOT A BOOB
@Jerma985 you could've just just grabbed the other ones
you gotta go to the next one you can't get there
@Jerma985 You need to kill the hulk so he can get more money
just like how i drink alcohol without the alcohol
@Jer
====================
the only way is to have the LUL of a comedian
I think they're not as good as they used to be
I can't believe you're playing this for the first time
you need to do this mission to unlock a new character
@Jerma985 When will the next stream be? I miss the last time I came here
Why is there a bat in the top left?
I can't believe Jerma got a free sub and he can't even use it
Why does Jerma think he has a 2 day old in his basement
@Jerma985 the joke is that you'll get a gift sub
@Jerma985 the vroomer is the most powerful weapon in this game
this is what you call an artist, they're all gonna get taken advantage of
@Jerma985 what is the plan for this game?
you have to be a doctor to do this
@Jerma985 If you die in the game you die in real life
@Jerma985 That is a shame. You should know the difference
I swear to god if you're not happy I'll be begging you to stop streaming
@Jerma985 you have to pay for the mule
@Jerma985 You're a loser, you're not a gamer
i thought you were supposed to go to the doctor
You have to do the jump to the bridge
this is what happens when you don't drink enough water
this is a game where the title means nothing
It's a lot less fun than the first game
I hate when you can't get it on the switch
It's a good game, I just don't get it
@Jerma985 you can do a little bit of that
Jerma is the only person on twitch that actually knows how to read LUL
There's a mod for this game that has been in development for like 5 years
Jerma how do you like the new meme?
@Jerma985 that's not true, you can't say that in the discord chat.
youre a boomer and the internet is bad
You cast SUS! You sense the next scheduled stream starting in 1 hour and 5 minutes, but he may be up to an hour EARLY!
Jerma please, I need to watch some Joel streams :)
jerma why do you have a porn folder in your twitch chat?
i cant believe i've seen a streamer die to a house flipper
@Jerma985 You need to tell him to do it
why is it so quiet? i love this game
I love how Jerma just repeats his lines
@Jerma985 It's like the game is trying to tell you the exact time it was born.
this is like watching a child play with the ball
@Jerma985 can you pause the game for a bit
@Jerma985 I want to see you do the whole game
you can do a little bit of that
i can't believe jerma is getting addicted to drugs
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
You have to be a doctor to do this
@Jerma985 It's a great game, it's just not that fun to watch
@Jerma985 you can always get a lot of money from that
I'm so happy that Jerma is having a fun time
Dont say that, I'll be dead if you do it
that's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
@Jerma985 The game's not designed to be fun, and it's not fun
jermaSun i cant believe it's been 2 years
i think this guy is a virgin now
@Jerma985 When are you going to play the Contra Hard Corps game?
@Jerma985 you can change the "hey" to "I'm not a gamer"
he's gonna be the one doing the final boss
what the fuck did i just come into
@Jerma985 the first thing you do is to get the fuck out of the water
i wonder if this is an early 2000's game
yeah its the same thing as the first game
@Jerma985 you have to do this in the chat
I would have done that if I could
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -176. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
i think i saw a guy on the internet
jermaOld Back in my day we didn't need to get our coffee.
jermaOld back in my day, we used to have a lot of snow in the winter
there was a bug in the basement that ate the shit out of my pants
I love how Jerma just repeats his lines without changing them
JERMA YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR YEARS
he's got like a few vrooms, like a little bathtub
i think the game just makes you do stuff and stuff
he
====================
I'm just watching a horror movie and I'm not a fan of the game
@Jerma985 what are you supposed to do?
Did he actually beat the game? He had to save it

@Jerma985 you're playing this game on the phone
i like how jerma just doesnt read chat so much LUL
@Jerma985 you can keep the mario hat at the bottom of the boat
it's not like you're gonna be able to hear them
@Jerma985 dont worry, it's not a bug, just that it's been found on the beach and it looks like it's from a storm
@Jerma985 You can buy the DLC if you get a discount
i can't believe jerma is playing this game in front of me
@Jerma985 I'm not sure what you're talking about
i'm a new viewer and i thought the stream was over
I'm not gonna lie, this is the worst joke ever
@Jerma985 hey jerma can you give me a sub
@Jerma985 YOU CAN USE THE BRIDGE THAT DOESNT EXPLODE
@Jerma985 you're doing a great job, and I'm proud of you.
@Jerma985 You can use the shortcut to the sewer.
I have a feeling that you're gonna hate this game
@Jerma985 If you can't do this the stream is over
@Jerma985 You need to look at the easter egg
@Jerma985 you're a little late, can you stop for a bit?
@Jerma985 You can't just say "I'm gonna get killed"
@Jerma985 the guy who posted that is in chat
"I'm going to sleep, my night is gonna be rough"
@Jerma985 dont make it too easy on yourself, you're gonna get banned from the chat
@Jerma985 What if you're a superman and you're a sub

@Jerma985 HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 5 HOURS
@Jerma985 if you give the money you get a free item
@Jerma985 your streamer is just a dickhead. he doesn't get to the point of being funny anymore
If you don't do the tutorial, you're not allowed to do the tutorial
@Jerma985 I think this is a good idea
@Jerma985 this is the first time you're actually using the lightbulb, it's just a little different
@Jerma985 I think you should make it a point to pay attention to the background
@Jerma985 You need to go to the bottom of the map

@Jerma985 I was here and I couldnt see it
@Jerma985 I got timed out, did you notice? :)

@Jerma985 the real question is why did you have to do that
@Jerma985 That's just what you're saying, he's not on the card
@Jerma985 Do you not know how to turn off lights?
@Jerma985 use the ratchet for a super power
i just got here, what the fuck is this
Oh man, the big cat is doing something
The long one, it's the only one I think is funny
@Jerma985 if you can't do this with the sword, you're not a gamer
@Jerma985 If you're good at something never do it for free
why does it sound like you're in a "give it to him"
This is the dark souls of dlc

this is the worst joke taking more than 5 minutes to set up
you can only read the message that's been sent
why does the guy look like a 40 year old dude
jerma, how many times has he been timed out?
@Jerma985 You have to get into the game again and get a second chance
you would have to be a koopa expert to get it
Just like how they can't make the last song
@Jerma985 you can save and exit the game by jumping and jumping around the screen
That's how much you spend on a car
It's not funny if you don't have a girlfriend

I'm here for the new years, not for the jerma stream jermaPluto

@Jerma985 It's hard to watch, but I enjoyed the first part of the stream
@Jerma985 I think this is just a place for people to shit on each other
I think it's the same for everyone but people can see the difference
You can't have a life in this game
@Jerma985 you could have made a perfect song with the video
I am not a gamer, but I can make a better one
@Jerma985 put a battery in the pipe to charge the battery
@Jerma985 I'm going to go buy my own pottery and take it to the dentist
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure how long it's going to take to get Jerma to finish this game
jerma, how long do you think the stream will last?
This is a lot of fun to watch
I'm an engineer and I don't know how to use a calculator
@Jerma985 I'm your mother, I have to go to work tomorrow

jermaPluto i dont even know what is happening
the 1st one is the most realistic one
@Jerma985 You could have gone for the worse one.
@Jerma985 you should play the game "subliminal messages" for the first time

@Jerma985 You can get a free gamecube gamecube controller if you just play it on your pc
The only thing that makes me happy is watching jerma play a game that is so bad it's just a short cutscene

The screen is gonna be a whole lot of different colors
@Jerma985 It's not the final boss. You can just destroy him
I have no idea what's going on but I do know it's a good stream
JERMA YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME FOR FREE
@Jerma985 do you have any plans to play other games this year?
I'm sorry if you didn't see the video, but the game is already out
@Jerma985 You're a funny boy, you know that
@Jerma985 you can use the other item to steal from the merchant
what are you guys doing in this game? @Jerma985
Jerma is a complete piece of shit, he's just a cool boy
@Jerma985 There's a video on the website about this, you should check it out
i have a bunch of stuff i want to do but im not sure
they're not getting their shit together they're just making it up
It's hard to tell who's talking to the streamer
you can't even get a boost if you're not in the game LUL
the first time I saw the movie was at the beginning of the movie
did he ever say when he was gonna do a vr commentary stream?
If you had a wife and kids, would you ever do it?
I can't believe Jerma's still streaming this game.
@Jerma985 This is the first video you've streamed since the last VOD
I was gonna say something about this guy
jermaVenus when you're actually in the middle of a fight
@Jerma985 The only way to beat this game is to take it down!
the last time you went to the bathroom and he went "I'm going to pee"
I'm not gonna go to sleep until you get to the green screen
its like theres a third world country where the reds are all the way in the sky
i was just about to say that it was the hardest boss i've ever seen in a video game
@Jerma985 if you get the boots you can climb the elevator
He's never going to come back to the hospital
I'm actually starting to think this is a real life
why is jerma's mic so loud today? LUL
You just have to make the full line
they're not gonna make the money back LUL
It's the "I'm going to pee" joke again
Oh yeah, I'm gonna need a lot of time to catch up
@Jerma985 Why are you going to the basement
i cant believe you're still streaming this game
i dont think it's possible to beat this game without breaking all the rules
I had a dream that Jerma died to Pinwheel
@Jerma985 is that the guy that did the whole stream?
just watch the movies for the longest time
@Jerma985 PLEASE READ THIS, YOU ARE A PROFESSOR
@Jerma985 you have to take the water with you
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is 1658. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
This is the worst stream I’ve ever seen
I love this song. It's so sad that Jerma is still using it
what did i just come back to
@Jerma985 you have to do the final boss
Jerma do you have any plans to play other games this year?
If you're good at something never do it for free
@Jerma985 you need to make a save point and go to the red bar, that's the main way
@Jerma985 Just put the entire house in the middle
he's gonna do this as a joke
@Jerma985 that's why you're a good actor jerma
@Jerma985 do you think they will ever get the good ending?
@Jerma985 is it really a bad game if you can't play it?
I don't know, I'm just a fan of the game, not the game
@Jerma985 There's a frog in your room, how long has he been playing this game?
i think you can put a good block on the top left
i just got here, is he playing the next rumble?
oh my god he's trying to say the actual words
jermaWalk i need to go to the bathroom
Is this the guy who beat the first level on stream?
@Jerma985 The last time you were in the bathroom was a week ago
I swear to god if Jerma is dead I will make a JUP
@Jerma985 do you have any plans on playing other games this year?
@Jerma985 can you make a vive for the stream?
You need to be able to see the drain
@Jerma985 "I can't see my eyes" - Jerma
====================
I hope you like your car more than I like your car :)
i think theres a good reason for this
You're like the new Batman and it's amazing
i just got here what is this game
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this game?
how do i put the whole thing together
i cant believe hes got a childrens book
@Jerma985 did you get a sub to the stream?
jermaHeart its a good game, but it's a little buggy
I'm gonna give you $500.00 to win :)
@Jerma985 I have a feeling you won't like the game
i cant believe this is actually going to be an ice age
but if you cant get it to work, you are going to be a liar.
jermaWalk jermaWalk LET'S GO TO THE ERASER jermaWalk
you have to put the plate on the floor
i like the taste of hot butter on toast
@Jerma985 i thought you said that you didn't want to play this
I bet you didn't even read the title of that one
You gotta get the boots for this boss
@Jerma985 You can use the boots to get in the arena
@Jerma985 please do the underwater voice so we can hear it
i cant believe jerma is a robot :)
@Jerma985 You should play this game on your own
@Jerma985 It's a thing and it's a good thing
did you just say you were gonna be a fucking psycho?
@Jerma985 you can find the secret menu in the menu bar, then go back to the menu bar to get the secret menu
@Jerma985 you need to be able to get the coin
Jerma, you're going to have to drink a gallon of water.
@Jerma985 you can get a little discount on all the big macs
@Jerma985 You need to buy a bunch of rocks to get the other one
so the stream is gonna be like this
imagine if this was a game about the lego lord of the rings
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that won the boomer game?
there was a big enemy with a gun
@Jerma985 You can't just tell the story to someone who's already played it
If you werent a twitch streamer you'd be a boomer
@Jerma985 This is a really cool joke, hope you enjoy it
i can't believe this is a real stream
@Jerma985 your level is too high, you need to get up to level 2
Why does he have to go all the way back to the castle
@Jerma985 If you see the moon, you know it's a really big moon
You can't even put it on the floor
@Jerma985 Why are you still playing this game?
theres a bunch of cieling in this game
@Jerma985 It's a new game, this is what happens
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this in the first place?
you need to take your shoes off before you go to the bathroom
He's never gonna beat this game because he never got his shit
@Jerma985 You don't need to put the boots on the floor
"I don't know what you're talking about" - Jerma985
JERMA I DONT HAVE A BOWL FOR A COW
It's a lot easier to be a bad person than it is to be a good person
if jerma was alive today we would be dead already jermaPluto
he's just a good boy, he's just not as good as he used to be
@Jerma985 No, they're both from the UK.

This is the last time we see you LUL
I like to watch you play with my dad :)
I hope the last time you use the bathroom you just look at the floor
hey guys if you wanna know what the fuck is happening i've been watching your streams for 2 hours
I just came back, why is the streamer still on this?
the most beautiful person on this planet is you
I can't believe Jerma is a fake gamer
@Jerma985 you have to make a new one first
We all know you can't do it, but can you do it?
====================
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUN,
@Jerma985 this is the only game you are going to play
@Jerma985 you have to click on the bars to get the "invite"
@Jerma985 you need to build an army to keep your troops from getting eaten
@Jerma985 it's called the "Invalidate your vote" thing
jerma is a dog that can't eat anything
@Jerma985 I got a pizza, and it's still good
jermaPop jermaJex2 jermaJex2 It's the only emote that has been removed, jermaPop jermaJex2
this is the guy who made the whole game
@Jerma985 hey jerma can you do a funny voice?
@Jerma985 you should have the body bag instead of the other ones
I thought you were going to play this
@Jerma985 You can't kill him just start over
@Jerma985 you can get the chicken on the ground
no wonder he went to sleep like this
you should do the big gold door joke
Jerma is gonna have to play this game
@Jerma985 You have to stop the gameplay and play the music
@Jerma985 You can get a bone sword from the statue
You can do the one in the bottom left
@Jerma985 did you do the hit and run stream?
@Jerma985 can we get a little more serious here
JERMA JUST ANNOUNCED A VIDEO GAME THAT IS ACTUALLY POG

what the hell is a jerma joke what the fuck
I didn't know that jerma was a dog
I want you to play as the other dogs
@Jerma985 you said you were gonna play the game that wasnt made for children
Why is this game so hard to watch?
@Jerma985 You have to see all the buttons
I remember that one time I had a dream where I was the only person on earth that could figure out what the fuck was going on
@Jerma985 play the game again to make it better
i hope you get better at this game :)
@Jerma985 the game is designed to be played in a hard mode
He's doing a full orchestra of voices and it's not even funny
this game is gonna be a mess LUL
I like how Jerma is trying to pretend that he's not actually a doctor and not just a streamer, but a kid
Jerma is the one guy who doesn't want to live with his mom
cheer100 Hey Jerma, I'm glad you're doing a great job. I'm really looking forward to seeing you play this game. I really want to see you play it, but I can't get a date for when I'm gonna be watching the stream.
my grandma just gave birth to me and she's crying
@Jerma985 Just put the light on to make it look like your house is burning
@Jerma985 is this the new Pokemon? @Jerma985
i love the music and the way you make it feel
hey @Jerma985 did you get the boots?
"hey guys i got a new laptop that looks awesome"
@Jerma985 you can use the left mouse button to delete the last frame
if you can't eat food on stream you're not a human
@Jerma985 go to the back of the store
i think it's just a bug, it's not a joke
i think its because they have a huge amount of plastic in the bathroom
@Jerma985 the fuck are you talking about?
its just a bootleg game with a million dollars in cash
I'd be a great one guy if I were Jerma :)
jerma can you please play the rest of the game
I think you're a bit of a scientist now.
@Jerma985 i got a pizza. and it's still good.
@Jerma985 you should have put the door with the hulk in the back, he's a little bit bigger
@Jerma985 DO A TON OF TRUCKS IN A SITTING

@Jerma985 are you going to play the Monster Rancher series?
I wish they put on a song about the end of the universe

the guy who got a fuckface in the tutorial
@Jerma985 I'm gonna shit if you don't tell me you're a jerma fan.
i just got here and i just got here
@Jerma985 I think you need to level up your weapon
That was a good idea to get the final boss before you die
you could have used a manual or something
@Jerma985 I have to be a bit taller than you to get a better look
jerma is literally the only person who's ever played this game
is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
I just got here, what's going on? :)
jermaWalk ILL MAKE A NEW PERSON IN THE NEW JERMA jermaWalk
I'm gonna go back to the carnival, you know that?
i wish i had the money to buy that mod
I'm gonna need a facecam for the next stream
@Jerma985 You can just keep them in the first place
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -362. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
it's gonna be a cool stream when it comes to simpsons
I hate that this guy's been on this channel for like 3 years
you have to be on the moon to have a light
this is what they call a "franker" stream
@Jerma985 Go back to the ship and turn off the lights
@Jerma985 Hey Jerma, can you make a new song?
if you can't beat the game then don't play it
I just got here, what the hell is this?
@Jerma985 Put the part of the song in the intro
we're gonna see you at the carnival stream
its not a secret you need to get the slime
@Jerma985 You can do this with the other hand
@Jerma985 go back to the beginning of the game and play the tutorial again
i heard jerma is a great actor :)
I don't think this is an e3 event
Jerma, you have to stop the stream for me.
he is going to get a heart attack
LUL he just wanted to get his money back
Is this the guy who died to Pinwheel?
jerma you have a great character, I love you <3
@Jerma985 you know what they say, you have a terrible sense of humor
@Jerma985 I'm on the same screen, can you stop pretending?
the game is supposed to be like this
It's the power of the katamari rooster
jermaWalk DREW CREW IS IN THE HOUSE jermaWalk
@Jerma985 you have to do the "what are you talking about?" joke
jerma, i'm trying to do my taxes and you're telling me to go to the bank?
@Jerma985 you can do that with the other hand
imagine not using a mouse for this game
jermaWalk GIVE ME YOUR FOREHEAD AND I WILL MAKE A BOOB JOKE
Jerma is the giant rat that makes all of the rules
@Jerma985 you have to make it on the island
It was a real-world example of how to deal with the plague
@Jerma985 Can you please move on from the rats?
if you were a kid you would have stopped the stream
jermaOld I'm just a human being, I can't hear you.
Can we get a facecam so we can see the 2ndJerma pic?
youre the only one who's ever streamed this game
imagine getting your hair pulled back in order to cover up your bald spot
@Jerma985 Are you planning on playing more dreams today?
Jerma is going to turn into a scooby doo character
I was a kid, I remember when we were in the pool
@Jerma985 just go to the bottom of the screen, you can climb there
@Jerma985 You can't just cut it out with a knife
I'm not gonna lie, I'm really glad I can watch this
@Jerma985 I know what you're talking about, you're a funny guy.
you can't call me a jerma fan because I don't have a youtube channel
this is like that one game where you just run away from the cops
is this the streamer that was in the shower and beat a kid?
This game is the best part of the movie
Jerma can you please make it a little less than 5 minutes?
i feel like this is a new idea
it isnt the fault of the gamer, it was a failure
@Jerma985 you can still make it up on your own
You need to get the rings to unlock the secret door
@Jerma985 The only way to win is to not beat it
====================
One of my favorite games of all time is Call of Juarez, it's one of my all time favorite games.
I think you are the only one that can see this
i don't think you can do this jerma
chat is still going so fast no one will notice
this is the best part of the stream
@Jerma985 you can't have a car with a manual transmission
@Jerma985 I'm the guardian of sus! I thank you for your service!
jerma is playing a game he likes so much
is he gonna be able to get the easter egg again?
Jerma, if you don't get your wink done, I'm going to have to take my own life
@Jerma985 JERMA, I think you've broken your kneecaps
@Jerma985 just add a second text to the end
I think you need to get the mouse to do the first part
How did the developers make this game so easy
I dont think he's going to get that much
@Jerma985 why do you have to put a plate on top of it?
@Jerma985 it's like when you're in a movie
@Jerma985 you're going to die if you get stuck
@Jerma985 I just got back, is he still doing the first part?
I want to see the AI that plays this game.
@Jerma985 You can buy the new Mount and Blade DLC

@Jerma985 You can't beat the boss if you have no boots.
@Jerma985 This game is my favourite game of all time
I would have watched you if you had done this
@Jerma985 You need to get the other pieces in the car

I think you have to put the other two to the back of the car
I never knew that a casino was on the line
jerma is in the black hole what a god of a gamer
I just got here, what happened? Is this the streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
You can't make fun of him if you don't want him to die.

@Jerma985 how are you still in the game?
@Jerma985 Can you tell us the story of your parents and you?

@Jerma985 are you going to play the entirety of the game?
@Jerma985 you need to pick up the coins
@Jerma985 The "unfriendly" guy is actually a real actor
I think the main character is the star of this
@Jerma985 YOU'RE A DICK BUT NOT A DICK
dude I hate this game, i love this game
@Jerma985 Did you know that no one in the world is real?
this game is my favorite game of all time
it's okay if you don't play it then you can't go back
you have to take the phone out of your pocket
LOOKS LIKE THE NEW JERMA IS HERE jermaVenus
SOMEONE KEEP IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR
@Jerma985 what's the worst one you can do?
i was gonna say this is a joke
jermaVenus "This is a new era of capitalism"
@Jerma985 you need to put the other ones to the back
Hes just a weirdo that makes money from the advertisements
@Jerma985 You have to save
====================
This is the only way to win the game :)

He's gonna be a maniac when he finds out what he's doing
@Jerma985 you have to do the cooking stream, you can't stop us
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules
This game looks like it's from a horror movie
If I had a sub I would donate $50
I don't think they're going to get that one
I think it's a video game game reference
He's going to be in a "stream over" state
@Jerma985 you can get a free copy of this game for like $5 from EA
@Jerma985 You need to take a picture of your face to get the new one.
how do you not know what a baby is
jermaSour when you're a chad and we know nothing
i feel like the emote is not as strong as it should be
It's only been like a week since we last saw the stream jermaPluto
if you can get a computer, you can get a computer
This is the game of the year, which is going to be great
I think I need to know what your special sauce is
I would rather watch someone play this game than the actual game.
if you arent a millionaire this is just how you feel
we need to get to the point where Jerma has to play the game for us.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -93. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points. TPFufun
@Jerma985 I think it's time to go to the bathroom

The character looks like the hulk from that movie
The official intro for the game is like 40 years old
@Jerma985 You should play Ace Attorney on stream
@Jerma985 Do you think you'll ever play a game like this again?
It's a trap, you can't get past it

jermaChomp 📣 JERMA MY SON IS DEAD, LET ME TAKE A SHIT
@Jerma985 you're gonna lose a bunch of money
@Jerma985 Why is your new house just like the old one?
you're going to go on a rant about how fucking awful it is
@Jerma985 you can upgrade the buildings in the sewers
He's a god gamer, you can do it.
i'm gonna be honest, I'm a bit of a glutton for a burger.
Jerma you're playing this game for the first time and you're getting one hell of a headache

@Jerma985 can you change the background music?
@Jerma985 You are not allowed to speak english in this game

He's gonna get in trouble for being late
@Jerma985 you can do a video game show
@Jerma985 Do you have a tattoo of you on your chest?
@Jerma985 You can press the button on the bottom right side of the ship to release the left
Jerma is a mommy dog, he's not going to stop eating the cereal
@Jerma985 if you could go back to your other life, what would it be?

jermaSun I am the master of this universe jermaSun

@Jerma985 The creator of this game is in chat
I can't believe you're a streamer, you're a boomer
@Jerma985 You're gonna get banned from twitch chat
@Jerma985 I'm going to call the police on you
i think it was when you were in that boat
I just woke up from my nap. What is this?
Jerma you need to stop this stream from going on for two hours

you can shoot a bullet through the wall
JERMA PLEASE CHANGE THE VOICE YOU ARE MAKING THIS GAME SO FUCKING FUN

@Jerma985 I'm only in here to watch the stream
I love how you're saying "the game is rigged"
@Jerma985 It's like you're not even there yet, are you?

@Jerma985 You have to hit the road to get to the town
jermaChomp 📣 YOU HAVE TO DO IT, YOU SICKO

You can only get a few games at a time
this is the worst time to play this game
i can't believe you're still playing this
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this game
@Jerma985 did you know that the cox attack on japanese servers has been going on for an hour?
I don't like how Jerma isn't even a real person anymore
jermaOld I'm a 34 year old and I don't remember this game
@Jerma985 you should play this game with a controller
I remember the first time I saw a jerma emote
Jerma I'm having a hard time believing you are still streaming. I'm so fucking confused
I'm glad you're playing this game and not the game I want you to play.

jermaWalk GO TO THE BATHROOM TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM jermaWalk
i bet you can't get a full head of lettuce
@Jerma985 This is a very different game than the first one
you need to make a ladder to the first level
@Jerma985 I just got back, you can look at the map
@Jerma985 just go in the middle of the map and go straight
@Jerma985 you need to throw the sword in the fire
I can't believe Jerma's playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 You need to get the shovel to do the "arm"
jermaOld I'm so used to a game like this
@Jerma985 Do you think that would be a good stream?
@Jerma985 i think this is the reason you didnt finish the first level
JERMA IS A FAN OF HIS OWN JERMA
i think he just wanted to go home and eat
Jerma you're getting old, you're going to get old
@Jerma985 you can do it if you do a good job :)
I can't believe Jerma died to the giant rat in TF2
Why do you sound like you have a floppy drive
@Jerma985 he's a cop he's in the police station
@Jerma985 You can't just throw a rock at them
@Jerma985 do you know the actual definition of insanity?
you have to do the same thing over and over again
I can't believe Jerma's streaming is in his basement
my dad said it was a joke and he died
If you can't tell a joke, it's not funny
@Jerma985 just have your arm cut off and then a purple heart will come out
@Jerma985 You gotta shoot the guy with the grenade
@Jerma985 when you do a really good job, you'll get a lot of free subs
@Jerma985 you can hit the wall to get the money back
This is the worst boss fight in the game
i think it was just an innocent kid
@Jerma985 Jerma, I can't believe you're playing this game for the first time.
@Jerma985 You should do the water level from the first game
@Jerma985 I just got here and you're still playing this?
@Jerma985 you're going to lose so much money in this fight

jermaOtto "Hes not a man, he's a dog"

It's like you're going to get hit by a car
i just got here and he's still in this house
@Jerma985 Did you ever get a key to the door?
Jerma i'm still hungry, do you know how much I make?
"if i eat a shoe, will you eat a shoe?"
@Jerma985 You can't take the fall damage because you're too low
The first thing Jerma says when he gets the stream title is "I'm gonna be honest I'm really excited to watch this stream"
i had a dream i heard jerma be funny
@Jerma985 i just got here and i can't believe you're still playing this game
I can't believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
i can't believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
Jerma, if you play this game it's gonna be really hard
You need to stop watching your own streams
you should be a kid, you're gonna get caught
I'm sure you'd like to see this streamer play Mario Maker.
@Jerma985 if you get the controller you can have a better looking one
The voices in this game are so fucking annoying
@Jerma985 if you do that you're a terrible parent
I just got here and you're still playing this?
You need to be
====================
A letter from the Boston Celtics to Joel
The kims are the best, the kims are the worst
@Jerma985 just put the two jups in the box
The next boss is a monkey, he's going to fall down
Jerma just cut the batteries in half and you'll be playing with them
@Jerma985 Please don't tell the kid that you're a furry.
What's the name of this game, is it like a caveman or something?
imagine a boss that has been in a stream for more than 3 hours
@Jerma985 You can't just put it in the wrong place
I just joined, what the hell is going on?
This is the only place you can go to jerma
This is a bit of a jank stream
@Jerma985 You should play the other games, like Sekiro
@Jerma985 No one is using the camera at this point
jerma you should start using the power of the camera for the next game
@Jerma985 please don't make me the giant rat
why are you talking about it and not about your penis
how does this game not have a 2nd person view
@Jerma985 jerma you are literally the only person who can be mad at this game
@Jerma985 dont know what that is but it is weird
I don't know how to get to the next level
@Jerma985 what's your opinion on bttv emotes?
@Jerma985 do you think it's a bad idea to have a jermaLiedAboutOnLive
@Jerma985 You can't beat the first level of the game
this is like the dark souls of mario
jerma is going to have a heart attack
This is how we die, we get to be in the game

@Jerma985 make the bottom of the boat bigger
@Jerma985 use the blue coins on the other side

jerma is the only person who can be mad at this game
I heard the apocalypse is coming this year
@Jerma985 you should do a stream with Otto
@Jerma985 play the game and not the game
jerma you are my favorite streamer :)
I thought that was the thing with the cat, you should know
I'd like to see the streamer play the game, but I don't want to see him play it.
@Jerma985 you should go to the shipyard to get a bigger dynamite
you're gonna get stuck in the end of this
i just want to watch jerma play video games
i think i'll just be a girl when i get to 20
@Jerma985 do you have a diaper? I dont want to know
this is what happens when you don't use your own voice
I just got here, what the fuck happened
I think it would be better if he did a redo
I can't believe Jerma is streaming on time.
chat has never played this game before LUL
"I have to do it" - Jerma985

The guy who made this is a great guy
@Jerma985 You have to do the right thing
@Jerma985 do a one last hit in the game
@Jerma985 You should put on a full facecam
@Jerma985 I don't think you can hear the voices, it's just the music

@Jerma985 you should be a robot, that's why you're a robot
@Jerma985 you have to do the other ones first

@Jerma985 The devil is in
====================

@Jerma985 I don't think you're even a human anymore
it's a chad? its not a chad
@Jerma985 They're basically just a regular human with a different name
jermaPluto He's going to be late again
I can't believe he just fucking shat on his face
This is the guy who beat dark souls on stream
He's gonna play it again just to get his ass kicked
i cant believe this guy is a psycho
@Jerma985 you can turn off the lights in the corners
why does he sound like the guy from TF2
did you ever know that the music for a game was the soundtrack to this game?
@Jerma985 you can use the stone to get to the secret room
@Jerma985 Put your mouth open so you can hear the game better
Can you just run over him so you don't have to tell him to stop
@Jerma985 you'll be able to do this game when you are 100% in the game
@Jerma985 you can't have a bad taste in a bad game
@Jerma985 There's a thing on the side of the house with a little bit of cheese on it
@Jerma985 Have you tried the GoT? It's a very similar game
Just a reminder that I was a sub for a year ago
@Jerma985 I just got here, why is your stream still running?
@Jerma985 There's a new game coming out, it's called "Cursed Earth"
You've seen him before. You're in the past.
Jerma you can't have a bad taste in a bad game.
@Jerma985 Please play the new game of thrones soundtrack
@Jerma985 it was the story of a guy who dies to a giant spider
@Jerma985 This is a very sad game, please stop
@Jerma985 I think you've been playing it for a while
@Jerma985 The new trailer makes it look like you're in a room with a different camera
@Jerma985 I just got here, what the fuck is happening
you can kill enemies with your bare hands
@Jerma985 The only reason why I liked it so much is because of the intro
"I'm sorry I didn't get my gift sub"
@Jerma985 You can still buy a candy bar if you do it at a gas station
@Jerma985 why do you have a full-body mask?
you can't just go to the past and go back to the past
@Jerma985 it's a custom game, you have to do it.
@Jerma985 What about the fuckin Tunguska Shanty?
"I got a 20 year old son"
@Jerma985 This game is a lot more fun than I thought
this is the best jerma game so far
@Jerma985 what did you say to that man
@Jerma985 When are you gonna play another game?
@Jerma985 You can't do it with your hands.
@Jerma985 That's a great way to say that
I can't believe jerma is a bad boy
The only way to stop this is to have fun :)
Why is there a tiki torch in the hallway
@Jerma985 can you play some doom ost please?
@Jerma985 they're the only ones that made this game
If you're good at something never do it for free
we need to get a real jerma rumble
he's gonna be late because he's never coming back
i can't believe jerma is dead :( jermaPluto
you gotta do a 2nd floor balcony to get to the second floor
I don't think it's in the game
@Jerma985 If you have a child, put them in the room to learn to speak
the only thing you need to do is to cut off their arms
no theres a weird gold coin in the vault
I don't think you can actually make a machine with your bare hands.
i like how the whole thing is a fucking game
@Jerma985 you can shoot a hole in the ground
@Jerma985 So is this the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 can you do a flip and reverse?
Can we just watch the whole stream from the bottom of the screen?
This is the game that is more boring than the first game
i cant believe you're playing a game that makes you feel like you're not actually in the game
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the recent death of jerma?
@Jerma985 i'm a young girl and my mom said you can't stream until i'm old enough to be a sub
Jerma you're not supposed to play this game
====================
@Jerma985 The end is a little more complex than the beginning
imagine going to the dentist for a kidney stone and you just die
You have to do it yourself, or you will die
@Jerma985 It's the thing that makes you not want to use the guns.
@Jerma985 i need to be paid to be a doctor

@Jerma985 Do you have a guide for the game?
i just got here, what did he do
@Jerma985 You can use a controller to play the game, just be sure to put on the microphone and plug it in
Why does Jerma have so many bosses?
He got hit by the car and then fell down the stairs
@Jerma985 He's gonna miss the whole stream LUL
we can't stop now because of the big stream
@Jerma985 They had to get the boots to go back in
"the dude who did the poop joke"
@Jerma985 when are you going to play the sequel

YOU CAN'T BURN IT OFF TO DEFEAT IT
@Jerma985 you have to put the camera up top
@Jerma985 can you show us your other hand
I just got here and I'm STILL on this
@Jerma985 when you die, you have to restart the game
HEY JERMA YOU CAN SPAM IT LIKE THIS
I thought that was the end of the stream
@Jerma985 you don't have to do it now
I wonder if there is a hidden thing in this game
I remember when you said you were playing the mario brothers games.
Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -93. Use +2 or -2 to give or take away points.
@Jerma985 hey jerma, you said you'd play Kenshi
Jerma's gonna be in the next Jerma Rumble, chat.

Ster is the one guy that makes all of the rules
@Jerma985 The first game was a bunch of kids getting beaten up by the bullies and they didn't even let them win
@Jerma985 that's the sound you make when you say "i am the giant rat"
I can't believe Jerma's just fucking dying to Pinwheel

you have to do the first part of the puzzle
i think its the new book of the bible
JERMA YOU ARE IN A DROP, WE WANT YOU TO STAY

@Jerma985 You have to be a gamer to do this
do you think he has a tiny bit of a beard

jerma is gonna die in a few weeks
The first person to comment on a Jerma video is a fucking idiot
@Jerma985 That was a good one, I'm glad I didn't miss it, I'm sorry I wasn't the one who made it

He's a mommy with a toddler on the front
@Jerma985 you can see it in the video
you should have more than one camera, that's what the game is for
@Jerma985 it's the one with the dumb camera
you're gonna get a lot of fucking money
you can't do anything about it if you don't want to
I feel like this is just a joke
@Jerma985 It's because you're watching a game that's been on for like 20 years
@Jerma985 Do you have a gamecube controller?
i was actually thinking of a game today
this is the only game he's ever played
Jerma, you're not going to win the next game, so I'm not gonna be able to catch it
@Jerma985 this is the worst joke of 2019
@Jerma985 The only thing you need to do is kill the other ones
I mean, it's a game that's been around for like a year, it's only been in the works for a week
you can't beat the game without killing the other one
I don't know what that is, but I'm glad I didn't miss it
i cant believe jerma is actually a hobo
this game has been so hard to watch
I remember the days when we could all just watch Jerma's streams on Youtube and he'd be fine. But now we can watch his streams.
I didn't know this game had the

Jerma is just a bunch of people who don't know how to play video games
just put the snow in the ice

You have to go to the next level, the first one is the hardest
i think i saw the new ad for the movie
@Jerma985 you need to play the big ones, they are really fun
@Jerma985 use the nunchuck on your head to make it smaller
is this the streamer that beat dark souls 3 on stream??
@Jerma985 There are not too many people in the audience
@Jerma985 the guy in the bottom right is in the bottom left
This is like the intro of a new york movie
I think you have to do the "not hard" part
@Jerma985 You can only play on the disc that is hard
I'm a little concerned about how the stream is going
i can't tell if it's a good or bad thing
@Jerma985 there's a really good simpsons hit and run one

I love that you can be a furry and be a hero
if you get hit by a car you are not a hero
I can't wait for Jerma to die to Pinwheel!

theres a big difference between a jerma stream and a jerma show
I'm sure he'll be fine, if he does not get it it's a real disappointment
Why do you have to be so good at this game?
if you had a cat i'd be a happy cat
i don't think he's been doing the controls
@Jerma985 you need to have a saddle to get the boots
He's gonna be like "what the fuck is this"
i mean you have to put them in the bag for a loan
Jerma has been streaming for 6 hours and has been playing this for 7 hours
This game is actually boring, but the world is so cool
what's that, a horse? D:

@Jerma985 You have to have the characters to be the giant enemy spider
SourPls Just like what you said, I'm trying to find a way to watch this
@Jerma985 if you can't beat the boss fight it's hard
jermaPluto this is gonna be a lot of hype
I love how the town is getting so much attention
jerma please get your mouth smashed by a bus
jermaChomp 📣 DON'T GO IN THE WINDOW, DON'T GO OUT, GO IN THE WINDOW
I think he might have a pet rat that makes him happy
@Jerma985 Why are you streaming this game, I want to see it
@Jerma985 You need to start the game with the Dead Rising 2 soundtrack
why are you still here? what happened to your soul?
@Jerma985 you can pick up the boots if you get the boots
@Jerma985 the key is to jump off the ledge
I love the streams that Jerma takes to prove that he is not a boomer
I'm gonna get a +2 if you go the wrong way :)
@Jerma985 I was thinking of this game for a while and I just got here
He has to watch the stream live to read it

there's a lot of work to go in there
You need to take a nap to calm down
is this the streamer that beat dark souls on stream?
I can't believe he's still playing this LUL
@Jerma985 The difference between the two is that you can't kill him
i was just listening to a weird jazz tune and I didn't understand it
@Jerma985 go to the bottom of the stairs
@Jerma985 you can't say what you want to say, because he'll get angry
what if we kissed in the dream :)
@Jerma985 This is the same guy who beat Dark Souls on stream
@Jerma985 You need to shoot the enemies first
Jerma, you can't make jokes in this game, it's not funny
jerma you need to know how to cook
if you get to the other side you can just jump off the ledge
why do you look like a batman in this game
why did he go back to the back
@Jerma985 Hey jerma, I'm in the same boat as you, you're going to have to take the other side
jerma is gonna be an asshole if he doesn't put the order in
@Jerma985 You should have had a nice swing that gave you the easy kill
Jerma can't even watch the stream and can't even afford to buy the game jermaPluto
That was a great idea, I hope you get to play more of this game
@Jerma985 Are you gonna play more Animal Crossing?
@Jerma985 hey do you have a diaper on in the back?
@Jerma985 the game is just making you realize that you are going to die
@Jerma985 Please tell me you never had a big heart and a big ass
@Jerma985 YOU CAN SAVE THE GAME WITH A BONUS
@Jerma985 The other 4 can be really useful
I have to leave now, this is going to take like an hour
it's because the game makes it so you can't even go to the save
@Jerma985 you are the best gamer on twitch

I’ll be honest, I don’t think you’d need a second monitor

@Jerma985 don't you just want to see the family guy?
@Jerma985 you can't have a gun in this game
@Jerma985 There's a secret boss in the cave
@Jerma985 the only thing you can do is watch the vod
@Jerma985 You have to set up the auto-cam and then press the map button.
this is how you make a house in this game
i can't believe i'm watching this streamer now
jermaWalk You’ve been watching jerma for 2 hours, now go back to your home jermaWalk
hey jerma, when are you gonna play nancy drew?
how is it a thing to do with your face?
if you have a half life game on it's not the best
I feel like you're doing the wrong thing.
@Jerma985 You're the only one who can actually beat this level
theres a secret boss in this
====================
YOU CAN DO IT
@Jerma985 The speedrun is so long it's like an hour long
i cant believe jerma is a kid again jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You can't just say you're going to die if you're not going to die.
I just saw a cool chat gif of you
@Jerma985 Your favorite Jerma video is called "The Scary Movie"
@Jerma985 I'm so sorry you're such a troublemaker. This is not how we treat you.
@Jerma985 I'm going to be honest, I think you're gonna be the best streamer in the world
You'll need to do it first then. I haven't seen anyone do it yet.
@Jerma985 PLEASE THE BATTLE HAS BOUGHT YOU YOUR GIRL
this is like the worst part of a real car crash
@Jerma985 I'm sure it's just a mental breakdown
how can you not like it? its got candy
@Jerma985 You can get in the bathtub with the money and no stream
guys i just got here what is happening
is this the guy who died to pinwheel
I can't believe Jerma is playing this game
@Jerma985 there's a reason you didn't do it
this is the part where you literally die
just wait till he finds out how to get to the next part
You have to put your mind to something
@Jerma985 I think you need to be smarter than the average person
@Jerma985 did you see the new Pokemon movie?
you're supposed to go to the bathroom at the start
@Jerma985 will you be doing a whole stream?
JERMA you're supposed to go back to the beginning, you got that
@Jerma985 there's a really good reason for that, you can't do the mini-game
jerma's not gonna be in the next one
@Jerma985 No matter how hard you try, you'll never get the boots
This is the worst bit i have ever seen
how did you get so bad at this game?
did you say you were gonna play this?
Jerma is going to make me choke to death
JERMA YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCH A SHORT MAN
@Jerma985 What about the Simpsons Hit and Run OST
is this the streamer that got shanked by a 5 year old?
@Jerma985 I want to make sure you don't get a refund on your wink
@Jerma985 it's a game, the game is designed to be played
@Jerma985 if you do a bunch of taxes, you can get free land
I think you should be able to see it
@Jerma985 YOU DIDNT SEE THE FARTING DOOR TO THE ROOF
@Jerma985 what do you think of the game?
@Jerma985 you can have your entire team in one place
@Jerma985 you have to use the laser gun
I had a dream about a guy who ate two chicken nuggets in one sitting and the guy ate them all
i wonder if he's gonna play more of the final boss of this game
@Jerma985 are you going to play the rest of the game?
@Jerma985 we can see the same thing happening in the first place
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup5 jermaJup6 jermaJup7 jermaJup8 jermaJup9 jermaJup10 jermaJup11 jermaJup12 jermaJup13 jermaJup14 jermaJup15 jermaJup16 jermaJup17 jermaJup18 jermaJup19 jermaJup2 jermaJup2 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup2 jermaJup1 jermaJup1 jermaJup1
@Jerma985 you are a bad streamer :)
@Jerma985 Can you play the new pokemon game?
@Jerma985 you can make the sound effect louder
this is gonna be a great stream LUL
@Jerma985 you can press R to go back
you can't just do this to yourself :)
I don't even know what the fuck this is
@Jerma985 Why do you think you're a little short?
@Jerma985 you can get a new fad for this game
@Jerma985 have you tried to play the VR game
@Jerma985 When you're watching a movie, you can watch it live with a headset
@Jerma985 you have to watch the rest of the game
The only way to
====================
THE BIG BANG
@Jerma985 theres a lot of dlc in this game
i just came back, is he still playing this?
jerma is the president of the united states of america
@Jerma985 im the one guy, please give me a sub
i was here when jerma said he was going to play simpsons hit and run
@Jerma985 You should use the dpad to get a better angle
@Jerma985 You can use the circle to make a circle
I think this game would be funny if it wasnt so fucking dumb
jerma you should do a shitpost to your own channel
I think you're the one guy, I don't like that
jerma is the only one who uses the xbox controller LUL
@Jerma985 the one with the jerma emote is literally just a strawman
@Jerma985 you got the fish from the top shelf
This is the most generic anime I've ever seen.
i feel like this is a new era for this
@Jerma985 You're a Jerma fan, I've heard of your streams and I know you're a fan of this game. I hope you enjoy the game and have a good night! jermaHeart
Jerma, you're not going to get the golden egg
if you don't have a gun you're not a gun
@Jerma985 It's just that you're a boomer, you'll be a boomer
I'm gonna be honest, I just wish there was more to the stream than that.
i have to go to work, are you okay?
I don't think you can go through this without getting a bad ending
@Jerma985 you can't make a house with a boat
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're playing this game on your phone
You can do that in a few hours
He's trying to get a shot of some laxative
@Jerma985 the first 3 levels are in the tutorial
@Jerma985 theres a lot of dlc in this game
He is trying to get a shot of some laxative
@Jerma985 the game is just like an old car
@Jerma985 i was here when he said he was gonna play simpsons hit and run
I'm on the phone with my mom and dad and they're still doing the "when I was a kid" joke
jerma you have to wait for the stream to start
I love this game, it's really neat to see the characters reacting to eachother and interact with eachother and its really fun to watch
@Jerma985 Just wait until he says he's gonna play Animal Crossing again
@Jerma985 you need to make it the one guy
@Jerma985 the snake will be more powerful if you do this
@Jerma985 I'm afraid to say it, but I think it's cool
jerma is the voice actor for this game
jermaPluto Jerma is gonna be late in 30 minutes
I'm not even here, I'm just gonna sit here watching
@Jerma985 There's a new game coming out sometime in the future, and it's called "Crimson"
jermaOld jermaOld my mind is too big for this
This is the streamer that couldn't beat FEAR on stream
I will donate $100 if he plays it
I'd love to see Jerma play an official game
is this the streamer that beat simpsons hit and run on stream?
i think he's trying to be serious about it
it's a good game, but I don't think it's even worth it
@Jerma985 This is a great stream, but I'm not here to watch the game
@Jerma985 I thought you said you were gonna play something else
@Jerma985 the super stream was just a bad joke
This game is a work of art, you should watch it
I'm surprised that you can see the ocean
Dont worry, you'll be a great streamer soon enough :)
The only good streamer is jerma985. he's the best
@Jerma985 you can't just be a fuckface and not make it
this game is a mess, it sucks, but it's fun
@Jerma985 you have to beat the game first
the old lady is a vampire, can't be a witch
jermaOld I didn't know you were a twink jermaOld
I hate the game, but I love the characters
@Jerma985 what is your opinion on the Jerma T-shirt?
@Jerma985 jermaOneguy you could probably make it in here
i just realized im watching a streamer jermaPluto
If you could have a teacher you would
He said he was going to play simpsons hit and run tomorrow
oh
====================
S
hey jerma, this is my first time watching you, so i'm going to be a little disappointed
I don't think that's how they're supposed to look
He's actually going to be a great streamer :)
i dont think he's gonna be able to see the vod
the speedrun is a bit more complicated than this
@Jerma985 You don't have to worry about getting a little bonus in the game
@Jerma985 what's the secret to being a good streamer?
i hope you dont have to put on your clown costume again
@Jerma985 The ending of this game is going to be a good one
you just took the shit out of it
@Jerma985 This is the only way to win this fight
jerma i'm the biggest jerma fan in the world
jerma is like the guy from the spiderman movies
You have to pay for the car, not the food
That was so hard for me to believe
I just got here, what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 you should do the original boss of this game
@Jerma985 I think you need to use the high ground to get the big drops.
@Jerma985 You have to kill the AI and then it dies
@Jerma985 Make a small house out of wood
@Jerma985 can you just say it again, it's your fault for not having a sub
@Jerma985 If you're not a sub then you're a loser
@Jerma985 You should have a QTE of "THIS IS HOW YOU FEEL"
this is the best chat i have ever seen
jerma's going to get a good internet joke
@Jerma985 hey jerma, i think you should do the poll
@Jerma985 The only thing that can stop this man is the final boss
I hope you can play this game for the rest of your life
jermaWalk LET'S ALL GO TO THE CARNIVAL jermaWalk
YOU CAN DO THIS FOR FREE ON TURN
@Jerma985 you know it's hard to be a "streamer" when you're just playing a game for your own enjoyment?
@Jerma985 You can't get to the start of the game
@Jerma985 It's a red light, the controls are broken.
@Jerma985 do you have to be in the same house as the other guy to get out of the elevator?
@Jerma985 I think you need to get the car to get the big drop
@Jerma985 DO NOT PUT A WINK IN CHAT
it's a 5 minute stream, you gotta play it right now
@Jerma985 why is your hair like that
I think Jerma has been playing with his cat for 4 hours
@Jerma985 please don't tell my mom to tell her I'm gay
I love that the game is over and he's still playing
Jerma what if I wanted to see your poop
You know what's not a joke? The fact that you're doing this
@Jerma985 you need to find the right food
@Jerma985 It's just a movie of the same kind
@Jerma985 Why do you have a toothpick in your mouth
@Jerma985 How do I turn off my son's music
@Jerma985 When you die, do you have to play this again?
I got some random shit to throw in
@Jerma985 I think you need to get a bed
@Jerma985 can you turn off the stream while i watch this?
I'm so glad that you're having fun with this game
@Jerma985 You can change your name to someone else and it's easy
This is a real funny joke, is it really funny?
this is the only way to win this fight
hey guys remember when jerma said he wasn't gonna play monster rancher again?
@Jerma985 you have to do the other side first
you need to be able to use the high ground
i think this game is fun but a little weird
@Jerma985 I think you need to find the door first
@Jerma985 you can't tell the difference between a yoke and a backpack
@Jerma985 the game is too easy for you
How can you not like it? It's got candies!
@Jerma985 you're gonna be bad at this one
just play the other half of the game
@Jerma985 You can use the high ground to get the big drops
jermaDafoe it's my birthday today, can you start the stream?
just do a backflip and get the boots
I think you're gonna need to put on a clown costume again
This is the only time I have ever seen you
I'm gonna have to get a new laptop

====================
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and see if you can take off the mask. Thanks!
@Jerma985 Can we get some jerma's chat for the stream?
@Jerma985 you just ruined the world for yourself
i wish i could get a sub jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Do the thing where you just say "I'm gonna go" and everyone just goes "Oh, I'm gonna go"
@Jerma985 please go to the bathroom and pee into the toilet bowl.
He's going to kill you if he gets too close to the camera
@Jerma985 You can use a drill to remove the mask
@Jerma985 Use the winks to get out of the castle
@Jerma985 you should go to the tutorial, it's pretty easy
jermaOld Back when the New Vegas came out, it was a long time coming
i can't wait for this stream to be over
@Jerma985 You can't just use the hammer to break a door
@Jerma985 hey jerma, do you think youll be playing on stream for at least 3 hours?
why is there a gmod thing in the middle of the stream
@Jerma985 you can press A to go to the other side
the red guy was a bank robber and we all know it
@Jerma985 This is the one where you just made a video
@Jerma985 you gotta do the other things to get it
I've been here for a while, the stream's been going pretty well
youre going to die at the end :)
I'm gonna be honest, I just don't feel like being a jerma fan anymore
@Jerma985 You just got on the wrong side of the map
@Jerma985 your voice sounds like that one guy who played mario 64 on stream
I just got here what is happening
@Jerma985 You should have a chat feature where people can tell you what you're doing
I don't think you need to go to the bathroom to do it
@Jerma985 I think you've never been to the bathroom before
i'm not a fucking idiot, i know the best way to do this
I think the one with the corn chips is the one with the cinnamon toast crunch
can we get a reminder of the labo stream
@Jerma985 There's a secret room in the top right corner
I just got here, what the hell is this
@Jerma985 You have to be a bit of a wimp
why did you turn off the camera? @Jerma985

====================
@Jerma985 its like the new vegas theme park ride
did you know that you have a right to be a furry?
@Jerma985 You gotta do some light stuff and shit, you're gonna be stuck in a hellhole for hours
if you dont get a pog you have to wait 10 seconds
just got back from the grocery store and hes still in there
Jerma needs to stop being a slave to the greedy jermaOneguy
they're not jerma's fault, he's an idiot streamer
I'm the only person who knows how to play this game. I don't even know how to play this game
@Jerma985 Have you ever been to a casino?
I hope he plays Jump King on stream
Why does this streamer have a diaper on
@Jerma985 do you know what a turtle is?
@Jerma985 can you turn up the volume for this game please
I'm watching the stream from a computer with my phone on
@Jerma985 why are you so angry you are talking about the gun
What the fuck are you doing to these people?
@Jerma985 I'm going to get a sub if you do this
I've never seen a streamer do that before
@Jerma985 YOU CAN MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A GOD
@Jerma985 You got the wrong part of the card
imagine being a kid and seeing the movie jerma985
@Jerma985 do you know how to make a pog?
I hope the vod is as good as the stream
@Jerma985 I think you can get the other game
i didnt know jerma was gonna get a jerma shirt
you can't have a good stream if you're not a good streamer
@Jerma985 No you are not. You can't buy a streamer
the last time we saw that you were a guy
@Jerma985 The last time I saw that was the last time I saw that
I'm gonna be here for a while, hope it's good
its like the chat in the beginning of the game
i can't believe jerma is a vroomer :)
@Jerma985 Why is your camera not being used
I think you need to be on the left side of the screen
i'm sure he's going to play it sometime soon
Jerma's gonna get a job at McDonald's
jermaOld I'm a terrible sports announcer, this is why I'm a good announcer
@Jerma985 I'll give you $5 to buy that game, I'll just keep it in the name.
You've got a lot of problems and a lot of problems to solve
@Jerma985 go to the elevator and use the cash to get to the next floor
if you can do a crossword puzzle, just do it in a room
I'm not sure if you're gonna watch the new movie, but it's a good one
Jerma you've been playing this for 5 hours and you just killed a cat
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that got addicted to crack?
@Jerma985 you can have a whole stream dedicated to the same joke, but you get to skip the parts you're bored of
@Jerma985 Can you do a funny joke to get a sub?
@Jerma985 is this the streamer that beat mr. mario on stream?
do you need a new computer to play this?
jerma why do you look like a vroomer
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to kill this guy to get the money
@Jerma985 can you say "I'm a girl" again?
i think theres a password for the game
@Jerma985 theres a bar next to the first door
@Jerma985 It's not a secret you've been doing this for the past 5 years
i like the first one it's the "oh shit" one
@Jerma985 If you die, you die in real life
you can't even use the ladder without the ladder
@Jerma985 Make the other one be a pickaxe
@Jerma985 Play the tutorial mission to get the boots
you know what the fuck is happening
@Jerma985 if you're having a rough time, you should try "run"
@Jerma985 You got to do a few things, you know
jermaHeart im very excited for the new jerma rumble
@Jerma985 you'll be streaming in the next 4 hours
@Jerma985 the secret is that you can't get the top two
@Jerma985 I think you can get the top two from the other room
@Jerma985 can you do a side-by-side comparison?
The only thing I can do with a controller is watch Jerma play video games and
====================
A picture of Jerma is only 12 hours long
jerma is the only person i can watch jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You have to beat the boss to unlock the chest
@Jerma985 You don't have to play this game for the first time.
@Jerma985 im a furry and i do not want to hurt you
@Jerma985 theres a button for the door, you can open it
Why did you do this to yourself like this
you can buy a new weapon for the first time
Jerma why do you have a beard? @Jerma985
@Jerma985 the other character looks like you and he is now a complete psycho
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to kill the helicopter
@Jerma985 do you have a donation for the stream?
@Jerma985 Please stop, I can't watch you anymore :)

@Jerma985 You can't use the fire button to throw the rock
@Jerma985 "I don't know what that is, but you can't see it"
this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen
jermaChomp JERMA GO TO THE PITCHER THAT IS HERE jermaChomp
Jerma please do not make fun of me, I am a real gamer
Jerma you should be able to control your own posture
@Jerma985 If you're a Jerma fan, you should check out the new vr game called "Shit"
Jerma, you have been playing this for 2 hours. You are not doing it right now
Jerma is making this the worst stream ever
There are 5 of us, and the streamer is making 5 of us
I can't believe he's still playing this LUL
did he actually do that at the end of the
====================
This is the greatest sound of all time
@Jerma985 you have to use the stick to hit the ground
oh no this is the first time i have ever seen this
@Jerma985 can you turn the stream off please
i can't believe jerma is still playing this
theres a lot of jerma in this game
@Jerma985 The real dream is that you get a heart transplant
it's because you have a bag of money
What about the soundtrack to the Nancy Drew video?
you can't just walk away from a fire, can you?
The only time I get to watch Jerma is when he's late and I'm late
@Jerma985 why do you look like a seagull
you have to climb back up to the tree
@Jerma985 The game says you can't jump over the bridge
@Jerma985 why is your hair so messy
@Jerma985 can we get a no air raid sound effect?
jerma do you know if you have a facecam?
I like that you can see the ball drop
@Jerma985 why are you trying to run from the building?
i cant believe i just got gifted a sub!
@Jerma985 I am so glad to see you have such a good life. You are a real treat!
YOU HAVE TO BE A BABY TO USE THIS
@Jerma985 you have to play the secret boss
you need to get a new weapon, it's not bad
@Jerma985 The only time I've been able to get a refund on this game is when I was a kid and it was a big pain
i don't think he likes that one, it's got a lot of different themes
its the one guy who would have to do it for you
@Jerma985 This is the most generic video game I've ever seen.
@Jerma985 you have to press the buttons to the right to charge it
@Jerma985 are you gonna stream this new one?
@Jerma985 I got a new laptop, it's got a lot of work and it's also a lot of crap.
@Jerma985 What do you do in that game?
@Jerma985 You can't get a switch without the guide
@Jerma985 you've been playing this for a month
It's just a bunch of shit you don't understand
@Jerma985 Use your teeth to knock them out
@Jerma985 You're going to lose the game if you don't turn it off
I have to go now but I hope you're doing better than I.
you have to do the other 3 things
jerma you're going to make me cry
why is the kitchen the same thing as the bathroom?
I can't believe he's still playing this LUL
@Jerma985 I'm sorry to hear that. I've had to cancel the stream recently because of the gambling addiction. I'm glad you're feeling better, Jeremy.
that's why I come to you, to get out of the way.
Is this the streamer that ate his own face?
jermaPluto I think he's doing some serious poop
@Jerma985 The guy is a boomer, he doesn't know what a boomer is
@Jerma985 you don't need to turn off the lights
i just got here what the fuck is happening
imagine having a dick on your side and not being able to keep it together
@Jerma985 How many of you actually have the same taste
Jerma you can't just do this without the guide
@Jerma985 Do a Jerma in the middle of a stream
@Jerma985 The money is going to the bank
jermaWalk THE END OF THE STREAM jermaWalk
Dude this is a kids game, you need to play the game

Why is this guy acting like a football player?
@Jerma985 is it because you have a colonoscopy?
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO USE THE XBOX ONE
@Jerma985 just do the same thing, you cant stop it
@Jerma985 i have a 13 yr old version of this game
@Jerma985 did you know that theres a secret mission in this game?
@Jerma985 you got a lot of heart if you got a couple more
@Jerma985 you should check out the new games coming out
@Jerma985 it's a song from the flute band
I'd rather have a clock tower 3 than this one
i'm like a little kid and i don't have a clock tower 4
@Jerma985 You can use the d-pad to use the x-pad
@Jerma985 What's your favorite game of all time?
@Jerma985 you have to do
====================
FUCK NO ONE THOUGHT YOU WERE MEANT TO BE BIDEN
Is this the streamer who beat dark souls 3 on stream?
@Jerma985 this is like a good fishing game
@Jerma985 Just look up the test to see if it has a timer
Theres an entrance to the park near the police station
i didnt know this was in the game
this is what happens when you dont put on your armor
@Jerma985 what is your favourite game? i'm guessing it's the gamecube game
@Jerma985 Is this the streamer that died to the sun?
Jerma you need to be more careful of the walkers
@Jerma985 You should try to make your voice a little higher pitched, to make it more effective
I'm going to the store for you :)
Jerma are you a real person or a fake one?
@Jerma985 It's a game called "The Magma Golem" by the awesome band of developers at Mojave Studios
Theres a couple of people who are just saying "this is not a joke"
@Jerma985 you can get a free key for that
why is there a dragon in the water
you could have just bought the game already
I can't believe Jerma's actually playing a children's game
If you're having trouble with the game it's probably because of a bug in your computer
i'm sorry im a cow and i know you're right
@Jerma985 YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE END
@Jerma985 So are you going to do the other missions?
@Jerma985 you should do an essay on how to make a big budget film
@Jerma985 You can have multiple races, they'll respawn as separate characters
HES GONNA GO ON A FIGHT WITH THE DOGS
they'll come out of nowhere, we can hear them
@Jerma985 you're gonna have to go back and do the other one
you need to get more power, this is a huge difference
@Jerma985 why do you keep doing the same thing over and over
Jerma, you're like the first person to do a cooking stream
@Jerma985 you need to put the car in the big bucket
@Jerma985 "I'm gonna give you a free key to get a key for that"
@Jerma985 he is the only one who has that ability
you could make a movie about it for the whole family
@Jerma985 Please do another joke I want to hear it
@Jerma985 You need to do the other 3 levels
I want to see you play the other levels
@Jerma985 How do you feel about the lettuce?
@Jerma985 you're the only person who could do that
the game just gave him an evil eye
@Jerma985 When you die in the game, you die in real life.
You can just make it that way it's not really a spoiler
@Jerma985 Are you going to be able to buy it?
@Jerma985 you need to know how to get around the house
@Jerma985 You can't just give the starter and it's a loan to the guy that gave you money

i have never seen a game like this before
@Jerma985 the games just don't work on the pc

you have to be a doctor to save the dog
you have to take the time to find the car
@Jerma985 i think the only way to kill him is to take his soul
jermaOld you are too short to be in the game
This is why we dont talk about politics anymore
"I'm going to suck a fart out of your ass" - jerma985
@Jerma985 I want you to kill the bird
@Jerma985 How much are you paying for the game?

@Jerma985 There's a lot
====================
@Jerma985 you have to save the lady and not the guy

@Jerma985 i have a facecam on the floor
He said he would play more fortnite
@Jerma985 You have to do the money tricks to get the money
@Jerma985 what did you think of the new Sam & Max?
Jerma is a fake journalist, he only reads news
@Jerma985 you're gonna get into a pool of your own money and put it in the bank
I can't believe the guy who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream died
i have no idea what im watching and its gonna be a lot of fun
I want to see Jerma play the video game
I want him to play a level with the "Sonic" music
@Jerma985 put a bunch of cookies on the floor

@Jerma985 You're a better streamer than I've ever seen you
I like that the game just has no idea what it is
the first time i've ever seen you in person
@Jerma985 Do you know what a meat is?
@Jerma985 The only way to get Jerma to play the game is for you to play it on your own time.
Chat, what are the odds of this being a good stream?
@Jerma985 YOU CAN USE YOUR MOUSE TO EXPLORE THE CITY
the one in the bottom left is the only one you can see
@Jerma985 you just did it for fun, it's not a joke
@Jerma985 I think you should play the new Nancy Drew game
this is going to be the streamer that was supposed to be a scoundrel
you can do this in a new game
this is the worst stream I've ever seen
@Jerma985 This game is the perfect fit for the gamecube
jerma can you please turn off the sound effects?
@Jerma985 please turn down the volume on the second monitor
@Jerma985 I thought you were a motherfucker. I hope you have a good night.
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're still playing this
@Jerma985 What if you turn the stream off and play some music
@Jerma985 I just got my laptop and it's still working
@Jerma985 you gotta be kidding me, I think this is a lot of work for you to do
they need to get the alien out of here
if you have a reaction video on the front page you should know that
@Jerma985 can you do the voice acting for this
I'm going to die laughing and crying because of this.
@Jerma985 You're playing this as a kid, you can't be real
Theres a secret level in this game, you just need to collect the red marker
@Jerma985 I think this is a really good game
@Jerma985 this is the worst one you can play this
you don't have to save the lady! just a tiny little one
@Jerma985 I'm a mom and I've been watching your streams for years now

@Jerma985 You can't get the chainsaw that we need the chainsaw to
jermaOld they had to make this in the first place

I can't believe Jerma beat Dark Souls 3 on stream
@Jerma985 Please turn off the music please :)

Jerma is a GOD of a gamer
I like how Jerma's current FunnyPoint score is -7, 7.5%
I really want to see this game play it's own game

@Jerma985 You just say the same thing over and over
Jerma you are the best streamer, I love you and I hope you continue to be as good as you always have been.

Jerma is a PORN streamer, that's why he's late
This game looks like it's in the future
why did you have to put the brownie in the blender?
i dont think the ps2 games were good
how many jerma fans are in the chat right now
I can't believe this streamer beat The Thing
Is this the guy that beat DARK SOULS ON STREAM?
There's a lot of garbage in the game
What is the most boring thing to do?
How did you find that one guy? LUL
@Jerma985 theres a command in the tutorial menu that lets you make an easier level
jerma you can't just go to the arcade and buy the best game
jerma is the only one who gets the money
jerma is a master of disguise, he can do that
this is gonna be the streamer that shows his face on stream
@Jerma985 the game is really hard for you
This is the kind of stream I watch when I'm watching the stream
@Jerma985 You could have just watched a different guy
@Jerma985 you should get a 10/10 on the pee pee level
I can't believe he's playing as the robot and not the big cats
@Jerma985 If you don't like the game, you're a liar
jerma can you help me make my own pizza
This is the best game in the game

@Jerma985 is there a good reason to change your face?
@Jerma985 you can be a master at one skill
@Jerma985 you can make your own pottery with the brownie
I hate how Jerma's face is a pile of scrap metal
if you die in the game you die in real life
JERMA YOU NEED TO HEAR THE MUSIC FROM THAT VIDEO

this is the most boring game to watch
@Jerma985 use the energy bar on your hand to get more
@Jerma985 your dad is on the phone with you

@Jerma985 JERMA YOU HAVE TO USE THE BOTTOM LEFT
I would love to see jerma play this game

"I'm going to go take a shower" - jerma985

@Jerma985 That's the only thing I could get behind in life
@Jerma985 You look like a kid that was in a movie

I have a friend who's like 50 years old and he's like "What the fuck is this"
@Jerma985 How many times have you said you would play the game this year?
@Jerma985 you can throw items on the ground with the spear
if you don't know how to use a gun
that's a lot of money for a 6'2" guy
@Jerma985 when is the next jerma stream? i'm watching the vod right now and i have to report it to the mods
I can't believe you're playing this game again
@Jerma985 You can make the animals in this game easier to manage
how can i get a copy of the game
I'll be honest, I don't know how to react to the name "Jerma"
you can't save a baby in this game
@Jerma985 I'm not a child, but I'm still pretty dumb
I want to see him lose it LUL
@Jerma985 the sound effects in this game are really fucking bizarre
that's a good point. you can just not do that
@Jerma985 I think you can sell it for money.
is it just me or is this game a little too hard for you?
Jerma this is the most boring game ever
I thought you were playing the game for a second
@Jerma985 you need to do the second part
@Jerma985 put a "I HOPE" in the middle of every sentence
@Jerma985 do you ever do a "I HOPE" joke?
what the hell is this game about? I never thought about it
I can't believe you're playing this game again
Jerma you have a good show. I'm just waiting for you to get your foot in the door.
@Jerma985 you should be playing this game more often than you do
jermaWalk I NEED TO SEE YOUR EYES jermaWalk

I just got back from the VOD and he's still playing this
@Jerma985 can you turn down the sound? LUL
@Jerma985 you have to find the weapon first
why is there a giant black hole in this game
@Jerma985 the paperclip is supposed to be a bit of a Jerma impression
@Jerma985 The Jerma's Show? What a nice name
how long until he realizes that he's playing this game
@Jerma985 You can't get a free copy of the game
@Jerma985 "Just put it in the oven" - Jerma985
@Jerma985 you are going to have to do this again
@Jerma985 is it just me or is the game really good?
@Jerma985 You can't really use the steam button, you need to press a button
they were just making fun of you for being a degenerate
@Jerma985 You can probably find a place to sell that
jermaWalk When you're done with your job, go to the bank and borrow money
@Jerma985 you have to do the one more time
@Jerma985 This is the exact opposite of a good joke
@Jerma985 you are the only person that has a 50/50
@Jerma985 hey jerma, how are you doing today?
@Jerma985 use the shovel to dig for food
@Jerma985 put your facecam in the bottom left corner
jerma is the only person that plays this game
@Jerma985 It's a real kid, I'm just trying to tell you it's not
Hes not the only person in this chat
Why does the game sound like this? I can't hear it
@Jerma985 is that the guy who ate a shoe?
This is just the worst place to be
@Jerma985 why are you still playing this game?
the one with the face cam looks like a fish
if you don't get it then you're a loser
@Jerma985 you can get the 3rd one with the car
@Jerma985 The last thing you hear is "hey guys"
you could've bought it for the first time, and it would've been way cheaper
this is like a dark souls level @Jerma985
jerma why do you have the facecam on
@Jerma985 you gotta be able to see the water
What if the stream is just as bad
@Jerma985 are you gonna get a ton of money?
@Jerma985 YOU'RE GONNA DROWN THE CAGE SO FAST
@Jerma985 the best part of this game is that you can actually play this
you should have made a cake with your own eyes
that was the only thing that was going to come out of it
@Jerma985 im watching you play this game, please do it again
I'm gonna take a nap so bad jermaHeart
jerma can you have a glass of water?
it's not the first time he's been here LUL
You're literally just making the same level over and over
@Jerma985 You have to run up and down the road to get the last one
i love the amount of dialogue in this game
@Jerma985 play the fucking game and try to find a way to play it with the DLC
@Jerma985 It's not that hard, just be aware that the water is really dark
This is the first time he's made that much money.
@Jerma985 You should play a better game and have it be a "best of"
@Jerma985 Do you think the game's music is weird?
@Jerma985 The sound effects are so quiet they're like they're playing a game
he's too old, he's a boomer he's not good enough
@Jerma985 you need to go to the closet
@Jerma985 How long has it been since you said that you hate this game?
@Jerma985 that's a nice date, goodnight everyone :)
@Jerma985 make sure to clear the second floor
I can't believe I'm watching a jerma streamer jermaPluto
@Jerma985 you can go in the middle of a highway
@Jerma985 I think you should go to the other side
@Jerma985 you're gonna get hit by a car
@Jerma985 It's the first time he's been here
why is he so quiet when he's saying "WHERE ARE MY GALAXY"
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're making this game fun
He's not gonna play this game, he's gonna die
jerma is too old,
====================
S
there's no way jerma's gonna beat this boss
@Jerma985 your hair looks like a big dog
I'm so glad I was able to catch this stream
i was like "i'm not gonna be able to get in"
Why is the game so far in the back
"I'm gonna take a nap" - Jerma985
it's a new game for you but you'll still be able to play it for a while
you can have a streamer that doesn't know what a fish is
I'm sorry I don't have the gamer license
Why is the blood on the door but the floor?
@Jerma985 you have to turn the lights off to turn it on
That's the one I bought the most LUL
@Jerma985 if you had a third of the money
@Jerma985 is this a good idea or a bad idea?
I mean, I would be fine with it
that's just a small planet on the moon
I think they should have a way to tell the difference
Jerma you’re gonna get banned for this
jerma just don't put the game on your stream
i love that he's just holding it for himself
that's what you get for being a really nice guy
What's the deal with the "can i get a fahy" thing
you should have a new console for every game you play
@Jerma985 you are now a slave to the jerma985
you should do a 3d sculpting stream where you will make a movie
@Jerma985 he has to be in a building to be seen
i can't wait for the "the wimpy guys" meme
how are you doing that you're too slow
@Jerma985 It's a new game for you, Jerma.
imagine having a baby and getting a new baby
@Jerma985 Did you ever learn how to use a game controller?
LUL it's like a videogame where you're just a character
@Jerma985 You're gonna need to find the other exit
i have no idea what a game is
@Jerma985 you can do the full face
@Jerma985 you need to watch the vod for the vod
@Jerma985 you're gonna be playing this for the next 3 hours
He's still playing the game after this LUL
I just got here, what is this?
so many of you have never played this game
I like how you're just acting like you're a kid
jerma, you should stop playing this game to relax
You have to be in the middle of a war
Why is everyone on a weekly basis so obsessed with anime?
i have a dream about you :)
I'm gonna go to bed and wake me up
That's what I'd say if I were you
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 i swear to god if this doesn't start it's gonna be a riot
@Jerma985 can you do the voice acting for this?
@Jerma985 Do you think you're supposed to use the flashlight?
"I'm going to spend this money" - jerma985
@Jerma985 You should get a shot of water in the back
@Jerma985 Just like a hundred years ago, you need to play the game
I can't believe you're still playing this game LUL
I don't think you need to go down the stairs
if you get hit by a car you're already dead
i think its a bit of a secret LUL
@Jerma985 you can have a skeleton, it's in your inventory
jermaSun jermaSun i love you jermaHeart jermaHeart
He's going to play with you for 2 hours
@Jerma985 did you see the new gen 2 game?
@Jerma985 play the shit song from "The Thing"
i dont want to be the one to watch you play it
@Jerma985 you have to let go of the controller before you can use it
Jerma you have to hold the trigger to aim
I dont think the song is actually the song
You can do the full face when you're in the room
The Simpsons Hit and Run OST is better than this
@Jerma985 you are supposed to have a baby
@Jerma985 go back to the arcade and get a banana
@Jerma985 You have to put the controller back in the original, otherwise it will get stuck
You should be able to do that :)
@Jerma985 It's a good game, not a good idea
You are a good streamer, you're the best :)
why are you wearing a suit for this
@Jerma985 you need to go to the next area
i hope he's not gonna play this again
@Jerma985 You need
====================
@Jerma985 you can't run off the roof if you're not a civilian
You're not supposed to take damage with your tank
I just want to watch Jerma play the game

====================
You know, I'm a big fan of the "subs" thing, and I think it's really cool. I'm gonna start donating to a streamer and he'll get angry and say "subs" in my face.
I bet Jerma is not even kidding about the Giant rat
@Jerma985 You're doing the same thing with the DMC2/DLC
is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
i dont think that is how it feels
imagine not being able to do that if you have to
Is it just me or does he look like a kid from a cartoon
I was so excited for this game, it's not even that bad
when did you get that slimy shirt from your dad?
oh my god, is this the streamer that lost to pinwheel?
@Jerma985 Get the motorcycle and get your first gift sub
imagine not being able to play this game
you're doing a great job at this game
i think it was a bit too much
I love how Jerma doesn't realize how much he's fallen in love with chat
You're making me want to watch the carnival stream
Theres no way I can get past this
@Jerma985 if you cant beat the game you're a boomer
this is gonna be a long stream :)
you have to use the menu to control it
Jerma, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be doing this again next year
I have to get this game before i can legally download it
@Jerma985 you can turn the sound off and on again
I had a dream about Jerma and he got knocked out
he said he would stream in the next 2 hours
that guy looks like he's got a pogona
LUL no, you're not. Just like the old man
they just like to get their hands on it
this is the music you can hear when you're not looking
jerma is the one who got the money
@Jerma985 I think it was a joke about the shortness of the stream
@Jerma985 do you know what a dick looks like?
I'm not here for the boomer stream jermaPluto
I have a bad feeling about this game
I think you have to have a shitty score to play the game
@Jerma985 Your character is the worst looking character
if you are going to do that then why do you have to do it with a text on screen?
JERMA PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP IM TRYING TO KEEP IT REAL
@Jerma985 you can get a little more hair on the face
@Jerma985 are you playing as the Tango Frog?
I don't think you can just walk around the area in a straight line
This is the best stream of the year
he will never play this game again PepeHands
@Jerma985 I'm gonna try and get some water
you can't even get to the menu for the boat
"I'm gonna go to sleep" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 it's not gonna be like that it's gonna be a movie night
I don't think it's a joke, it's not a bad thing
@Jerma985 you're not gonna get it with the controller
I can't believe jerma's not a streamer right now
@Jerma985 i'm sorry, i didn't know you were a streamer
@Jerma985 You can't just put a shirt on
it's the same exact thing every time jerma says "SHEETO"
@Jerma985 What do you think of the show?
@Jerma985 When you said you'd play the game I thought you were joking
jermaChomp YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE CHAT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAKES THE MEMES
He's gonna have to stop streaming in the middle of this
i'm gonna go to sleep and wake up and have a good night
why is there a vroomer in the background
@Jerma985 the poor michael could've just stopped the car and just been there
@Jerma985 just dont get in the way of it
@Jerma985 You should add some custom emotes to the top left
i thought he was talking about the super secret level
YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR OWN, JERMA
What's the most your life has ever taken?
@Jerma985 You can click on the screen and press the buttons
i dont think that's how it feels
LUL this game is just like 2 hours
the only time this game has been played is on ps2
@Jerma985 I'm gonna take a nap please don't do this
He'll be playing the song 'Rabbit Hole'
@Jerma985 I think you're supposed to cut the water,
====================
https://youtu.be/kFQlH9sIiM
you have to go back to the elevator
@Jerma985 What if you're a rat and you're playing this?
This is just the start of the game :)
jermaPluto Jerma, you have to start over.
I'm going to take a shower and have a drink
I can't believe he beat this game in one sitting
i cant wait to see this happen :)
This is the most unprofessional way to spoil a good game
You can only get this game on Xbox One
@Jerma985 you can't say that to me Jeremy.
You should just start the stream right now
I think we need to have a poll for that
@Jerma985 You have to leave the hospital to get a new weapon
@Jerma985 Don't be a slave to the system
imagine not having a Jerma sub jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You can't have a pet like this
@Jerma985 "Why is the camera on the bottom left of the screen?"
i can't wait for jerma to play the new game :)
this is like when a kid plays with a controller for a whole day
I just got here what the hell is happening
this is a good game. its not a bad game
Chat is like a bunch of fucking angry people
@Jerma985 are you sure you aren't the person who said you were the bad guy?
@Jerma985 the guy from china is a monkey
this is just the first part of a childrens game
imagine having a good time and not getting the full experience
this game is just a retelling of a classic film
its like the devil is in your room
@Jerma985 how do you feel about the Animal Crossing stream?
what about the movie night? :) i just got here
@Jerma985 can you do the last mission with the first enemy
you are playing a game where you can't control the game.
@Jerma985 you can do it and you can do it!
you can't just play the game, you have to do the mission
the power is coming from inside you
I just got here what the hell is this
@Jerma985 you should have told us you were doing a "weird" joke
@Jerma985 I just got here, is it ok to make fun of me for being late?
@Jerma985 You can make a soundboard with the audio clips
@Jerma985 what if you were to eat the food
@Jerma985 There is no way you can do it
I'm not sure if you can trust me...
@Jerma985 this is the worst joke I've ever seen
This is a good game, I'm not sure I can be disappointed
@Jerma985 the whole house is in the shower
@Jerma985 PLEASE CHANGE THE STREAM TO VIRTUAL LAND
@Jerma985 you're supposed to make a funny video about you
@Jerma985 you're gonna get a haircut and the hair will be a full month old
@Jerma985 you can do a real short stream
@Jerma985 Just got back from the doctor. Your eyes hurt
@Jerma985 can you play the game again please
@Jerma985 the rest of the stream is actually just a fever dream
it's like the thing from the bible
@Jerma985 why did you have to put that on?
the wind is going to kill him LUL
@Jerma985 you can't just say you're bad at it
the joke is getting old, my favorite is the "Jerma is a zombie" joke
I'm not sure you can do it Jerma
@Jerma985 You can't get a secret car that is blue
I'd like to see you play a game of duck and the chain.
@Jerma985 don't let me get to the bottom of this
jermaPluto he has no idea what a god is
Jerma you can't say "This is my house"
@Jerma985 did you see the new Jerma game?
this is the part where the body is out of body
I've seen that video and it's pretty good
jerma is a gamer, he just doesn't have the money
@Jerma985 play the first game, it's free :)
@Jerma985 you need to eat the food first
I'm gonna be honest, I'm pretty sure you have to do the one thing that makes it go faster
He's not gonna get the 5th one PepeHands
@Jerma985 I've been waiting for you to do that
@Jerma985 Jerma, it's the dark side of the galaxy
i would love to see you play this again
you gotta be patient
====================
In case you're wondering, this is the guy who beat the final boss of Dark Souls 3 on stream
It's a bit hard to watch because it's just an anime
what if you dont get the message right in the first 30 seconds?
@Jerma985 you have to start a new game
@Jerma985 You can't be in a place where you don't have a bath tub
yeah but i like the game more than the characters
I don't think you can run in this game
@Jerma985 theres a hole in the floor that goes in the bottom left of the screen
@Jerma985 You have to kill the troll first.
@Jerma985 remember when you said you would play as the goblin?
i'm on my phone right now and i still cant get the stream over
This is the streamer that died to pinwheel
you can't have more than 1 character in a row
@Jerma985 can you do the catatonic pain scream?
Did you put the video on the internet?
@Jerma985 Why do you not have a 2nd Jerma
Chat has Bashed 519 Seagulls, use !bash to help DarkMode
the rat is a sex toy, it's not a movie
it's because you're a child, you're not allowed to do it in this game
its like the first one in the series
@Jerma985 what do you think of the other two
I think I've been the only one to use it
yeah its a bit hard to watch because it's just an anime
@Jerma985 you need to move the camera to the right
@Jerma985 you can actually play a lot of games in this game
i mean you could just play it like a normal game
you can use the drawstrings to pull up to the top of the ladder
jerma you need to stop this game from getting too scary
this is the same guy who said "wtf" on stream
oh man I love the smell of ass
@Jerma985 he's just an old man, he's been on for awhile
The last 2 times I've been here, it's been terrible
@Jerma985 you need to turn the light on and off
@Jerma985 I am so glad you're playing this

EVERY TIME YOU GET A CORNER CLICK ON THE FINGERS
@Jerma985 You need to upgrade your armor to make it stronger
This is what happens when you don't know how to speak
It was a terrible dream for the rest of us jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You could have put the little glass on the ground to protect your head from the rain
you don't have to say "I love you"
@Jerma985 I can't believe you missed the jup joke
I remember hearing that shit from a friend who is a fan of you
@Jerma985 you should play the game that you have a problem with :)
@Jerma985 do you have any of your own equipment?
@Jerma985 you can't buy it in the shop
He's got his own asshole to grind on
@Jerma985 put the body in the dumpster and put it on a tray

I hope it's not a fallout new vegas stream
this game is just a pain in the ass
@Jerma985 you have to wait for him to do it

@Jerma985 You're supposed to play
====================
Man this is literally the only thing that makes sense
i can't believe i'm watching the streamer that got addicted to gambling
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you get too high
@Jerma985 you're the only person I've ever met that doesn't have an anxiety disorder

@Jerma985 do you know what a horse is?
I can't believe jerma is a mentalist OMEGALUL
@Jerma985 You're not a gamer, you're a person of culture

why are you doing this to yourself? @Jerma985
this is like if you were playing as a kid and you just didn't know what a game was

He's actually going to die. I don't think he's getting the boots
you have to do a "no face cam"
@Jerma985 I think the mods are watching your streams, not you.

@Jerma985 you could have made a zombie invasion of the world
@Jerma985 I think you need to find a better way to play this game
I can't believe I'm watching a streamer who has never seen a roller coaster
@Jerma985 if you die in the game, you will be dead in real life
how are you supposed to know what the fuck you're doing
I just got here why is he still on this level?
i cant believe jerma is still on this level
@Jerma985 do you have the key to the keypad?

@Jerma985 I thought you were in the kitchen for a minute
@Jerma985 the game looks like it's from a different era
@Jerma985 this is a good idea, try to recreate it
jermaWalk Im gonna go, I just want to say how happy I am to see you here
I don't think you can watch Jerma with your facecam on

@Jerma985 you're gonna get a lot of grief for that
I wish you could have a second eye
I'm not a fan of the yoda voice
YOU'RE NOT A FAN, YOU ARE A FISH

@Jerma985 Did you know that a chad is a chad?
it's the same as when you play halo @Jerma985
@Jerma985 if you were to make a movie on stream, would you do it?
I'm not a fan of the entire game, it's just the first part and not the entire game
Jerma's going to get mad at the ring game and it will be a long and painful experience
It's not like he has the time to be funny
i was thinking about the non-sub streams

@Jerma985 do a
====================
Jerma, this is the worst stream ever

@Jerma985 You need to make a new house

LUL he didn't even say it right
@Jerma985 The other guy is gonna get a big gun

@Jerma985 Please do the new cooking mama voice
Jerma what are you talking about, you're not in the game
@Jerma985 You need to read the lore first to find the secret
why is there a huge white thing in the middle of the road
if you have an attack, you need to attack it
i cant believe he actually beat the first level
@Jerma985 I would really like to see you play it
I was in a bathroom and it was on the way to the bathroom
how did you get your bathwater? @Jerma985
you can actually climb up to the top
@Jerma985 I think you need to level up your armor
I think you need to do the following at once, you can only do it once
You need to go back to the beginning
How are you still doing this the same way?
you just gave the baby a shotgun LUL
JERMA STOP PLAYING THIS AND DONT PLAY IT ON STREAM
@Jerma985 It's called the "Ace of All Time"
Jerma you're going to get a massive sword

Jerma, you need to go to the body shop
you dont need to use the car to get the money
i just woke up and the cat is still on the floor jermaPluto
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sorry.
@Jerma985 You need to use your powers to reach the last level.
my uncle has a few funko pops and i'm excited to see what he can do with them
i mean it's not even a really good game
@Jerma985 why do you think the camera is in the middle
I just got here, is he actually playing this?
I just got here, is he playing the new game or is he just playing this game for a few hours?
i can't wait for the game to get made
@Jerma985 Just play the game for the rest of the stream
this is the streamer that beat pinwheel on stream jermaVenus
I can't wait to see Jerma get killed by a police dog
@Jerma985 You should do the same thing for the other guy
@Jerma985 use the PIKATO ON THE MUSHROOM PLEASE

jermaJup1 jermaJup2 what a nice jup jermaJup3 jermaJup4
it's like they're all the same person
@Jerma985 You can't just do the first part without moving
@Jerma985 I think you need to do the last part.
this game is just a bunch of characters talking in a small room with no lights
@Jerma985 You have to get a small version of the new one
this is the guy that beat the first level of dark souls on stream
I like how the old man is just still sitting there
I got here when it was just the old man
@Jerma985 Did you just hear the sound of the lizard being tortured?
You need to change the wii to the new one
it's really nice to have a space cadet
@Jerma985 just do a video of a guy farting and screaming
@Jerma985 why do you need the ice cream cone
Jerma I think you're a good gamer, do what you gotta
you can't buy a new house if you don't own it
@Jerma985 Can you do a tier list? :)
I know he's playing it, but the sound effect is a bit off
There
====================
How are you still doing the voice lines?
@Jerma985 you should do a "I just ate a shoe" joke
@Jerma985 I don't think you know what a mouse is
@Jerma985 please show the person who did the voice
how do you think a robot would react if its in a movie
This is a real stream, Jerma is the super streamer
We're gonna be here for a while, you guys are gonna be here for a while
I'm glad you didn't miss the last minute of the stream
so what's the name of this game? I'm just curious
i don't think it's that bad, it's just that it's really hard to get a good picture of someone in the game

@Jerma985 you can't make the same mistake twice LUL
@Jerma985 i remember when you were a kid, you would literally do a shit ton of dumb stuff and just go for the top of the tower
@Jerma985 if you just throw rocks at the enemies, they'll have to be stunned
Shelby you need to clean the floors and not the bathroom

====================
hey guys, I'm back from dinner, is Jerma playing the Ratchet and Clank games? :)
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
I'm going to be honest, I'm just surprised he's still streaming
i have no idea what the fuck is going on
YOU CAN GET THE SAME ONE FROM BONES
@Jerma985 Are you going to play Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo DS?
@Jerma985 You're going to have to finish the game
@Jerma985 Are you going to do the "You're gonna have a big dick" joke again?
why is he so mad about this game
this is just the evolution of the stream
You have to do the same thing as the first guy
@Jerma985 can you not do a Jerma stream
@Jerma985 Just joined the stream, what the hell is going on?
this is the most boring thing i have ever seen
i dont know what the fuck is going on
@Jerma985 you have to get a key to get the shire
@Jerma985 You can't just run in and have a free time
@Jerma985 can you do a jerma rumble stream?
Jerma is the one who makes all of the rules
you just ruined your own stream with that joke
I’m sorry that you’ve been playing this for 8 hours, but I love you Jerma
@Jerma985 You can still do it if you're an adult
@Jerma985 Do you plan on playing the next game?
@Jerma985 if you do it, you will be better than the other one
@Jerma985 You should play a game where you just beat it and it's just your own level
@Jerma985 It's really hard to get the sub sound
i love how the game just makes you look like the character
@Jerma985 Did you ever get your prime sub?
@Jerma985 you have to stop the tractor
"I need to take my shower" - Jerma985
jermaOtto "You can't just shoot me" jermaOtto
@Jerma985 do you think theres a fucking PENIS IN THE DUMMY
@Jerma985 you can't die from a dream joke
just got here, what the hell is happening
This is a copypasta of a movie
@Jerma985 you are a fucking sociopathic streamer, you need to be held accountable
jermaPluto yeah, it's been a while since i've seen that
@Jerma985 Jerma, I just got here and you are already talking about a game called Sonic Mania?
there is a way to get to the moon
@Jerma985 you're the one who made all of the rules
I just got here why are you so angry
@Jerma985 this is why you're late. we're gonna get the chat meltdown
is this the streamer who beat MGS 2 on stream?
@Jerma985 The blue part is the last one
i'm not a nerd but i hate this game
@Jerma985 Can you do a comedy stream? :)
@Jerma985 you can throw the weapon up to the ceiling
it's just like the game itself, you get to throw the coin
@Jerma985 I'm a moron I'm going to be honest
the music is great, but it's just the sound of a car
He has to do the right side
it's a dogshit stream, but the whole game is just the dogshit
Jerma is so cool and we all love him jermaHeart
im gonna have to go to sleep but i will catch up
i'm not sure if its gonna be hard to get the video
I can't believe he's playing this on his own stream
@Jerma985 You are the only one that can fix the world
@Jerma985 you know a lot of people have to work on the internet because they don't have internet and they can't afford to
@Jerma985 The dumbest shit I've seen in a long time
Why are you doing this to us jermaPluto
@Jerma985 You're gonna get a headache from that
jerma you have to put your phone on the toilet
I cant believe i missed the first hour of this stream
@Jerma985 you can't just punch the guy with the stick
I thought the stream was over before it started
I love how the game just makes you feel like you're the one playing this
how do you know you're not a gamer
@Jerma985 you are playing a game that you played a long time ago and it's a huge asshole
that's the only thing i can think of
I think it's a little too dark for me
I just got here, why are you
====================
One of my favorite characters is voiced by the guy from viva pinata.
This game is so much better than the last one
@Jerma985 You can buy the DLC from the Borderlands store, it's a DLC for the DLC
@Jerma985 They're called 'The Flaming Balls', they're the enemies from the new Scooby Doo movie
@Jerma985 can you not have a "he said "he said" in your stream title
This is the streamer that will be the next president of the united states
I would love to see the evil one in the kingdom of Jerma
@Jerma985 I did it to get the best ending.
@Jerma985 you have to go to the other end of the road
this is the end of the stream in real life
I think this is the best game ever made
why would you want to build this over the castle
@Jerma985 You need to beat the final boss
He's gonna lose his mind if he doesn't get to the end
I hope this is the last stream he's having
@Jerma985 when are you going to do the "what the fuck" joke again?
@Jerma985 i think its a week or two ago
@Jerma985 you have to shoot them in the head with the shotgun
@Jerma985 You need to save the princess, she is the only one who gets to leave.
@Jerma985 this is a joke, i wont be able to tell what the joke is
@Jerma985 When you see a guy with a mustache, try to punch him
this is the most chaotic stream i have ever seen
Is this the guy who beat the first boss of Dark Souls?
@Jerma985 you need to take out the trash and put it back on
I'm only here for the winks, don't tell me you won't see that
@Jerma985 why did you play that simpsons hit and run game for 5 hours
@Jerma985 you can click the button to move
i cant believe this is the guy who beat the first boss of dark souls on stream
you dont have to do it right you just need to do it the right way
@Jerma985 Put your face on the green screen and say "he"
Is this the streamer that beat the first boss of dark souls?
@Jerma985 There's a secret boss in the basement that's not gonna let you get to the roof
SourPls WE NEED TO SEE HIM IN THE WATER SourPls
@Jerma985 YOU CAN GET MORE THAN 10 BITS
you know, the one with a good soundtrack
I just got back. What the hell happened?
why are there so many of these
@Jerma985 how much do you pay for this game?
I've never been to a jerma stream, have you ever heard of this site?
@Jerma985 You need to go to the secret section
I can't believe Jerma is a fucking adult now
@Jerma985 do you think you have a bathroom key?
@Jerma985 You need to go back to the boat
I don't know, can you actually play this?
@Jerma985 Just keep going and get better results
@Jerma985 you should add an "A L E N T" emote
Chat is a bunch of fucking fucking idiots
@Jerma985 You have to go to the top
I'm gonna be honest, I don't think this is a good idea.
Oh my god why does it sound like a dog
@Jerma985 You can have a good time with the "fuzz"
@Jerma985 I think you can get better results from the other character
@Jerma985 the game is an adaptation of a book
@Jerma985 The stream was in the background when you were talking about how you would never play this game again
chat has gone too far in the direction of "triggered"
i cant believe theres a ytch on the main channel
This is the streamer who beat the first boss of dark souls
I have no idea what's going on
@Jerma985 what do you think of your own scuffed jokes?
@Jerma985 when is the next jerma rumble?
imagine a seagull that wants to be a sub
Why are you still playing this game LUL
@Jerma985 What's up, Jerma? I have to go to work soon
@Jerma985 you can't make a giant robot like that
@Jerma985 The Thing is a song from the movie
@Jerma985 He's going to get a heart attack from that
I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not.
I'm not a fucking idiot. I'm not even a sub.
@Jerma985
====================
Jerma has never played a game before
I got a bunch of fucking porn on my computer and I just wanted to send it to Jerma
jerma you need to watch the video where you talk about how you're gonna be streaming for 3 hours and then stream for 6 hours
@Jerma985 Just wait until you're at the end of the ride
@Jerma985 what's the name of the game?
oh yeah that's a really bad idea LUL
I love how the second one just takes up all of the space
@Jerma985 Are you the new Jerma985? I didn't know you were a good boy
this guy is a fraud jermaPluto he's not going to be able to afford the rent
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're the only one to die
@Jerma985 I'm a fucking idiot, I'm too young to know.
i'm gonna play this game again in a week
you can't make a game for children, it's too easy for you
you need to find the money to keep your house from burning down
he's not even gonna get to the boss
@Jerma985 do you want to play the game again?
@Jerma985 you're gonna be playing it for the rest of the stream
@Jerma985 I'm having an existential crisis right now and I just want to be able to go home and be happy :)
Why are you playing this game with a fucking fidget spinner?
I like that there's a fucking coin in the middle of the screen
@Jerma985 Why is the random guy in the beginning of the movie
jermaOld HE'S A STREAMER I CAN'T STOP IT
@Jerma985 I don't think that's how you do it
@Jerma985 The joke is that you're not watching the stream
@Jerma985 please keep it up jerma i can't sleep
@Jerma985 You have to do a 100% slime joke
Jerma please don't go in the water, it's going to be so annoying
I just got here and he's still talking about the toilet?
@Jerma985 Jerma, the devs of this game said it would be a waste of time
i wish i could get a jerma rumble jermaPluto
@Jerma985 What the fuck are you talking about?
@Jerma985 What is your opinion on the anime version of this game?
@Jerma985 Why are you playing this game with a kid?
jermaPop what is this game I'm watching right now
I'd pay to see you play it jerma
@Jerma985 You have to use the item in the chest
I have a memory of when I was a kid
why do you have a small voice changer
if you don't put it on, you're just doing it wrong
why are you doing this to us @Jerma985
@Jerma985 Please be quiet, my sister's boyfriend is a doctor.
@Jerma985 you can't just buy it on amazon
@Jerma985 why are you playing this game with a kid?
hey jerma i just got back from work and i got a really bad migraine
@Jerma985 The camera in this game is a little small
@Jerma985 hey jerma, im gonna go get some sleep. i need you to stop streaming for me, i feel really sick and can't do it without you.
@Jerma985 you said you were gonna start at 2pm
You have to pay the toll on the interstate
@Jerma985 I have the lowest score of any streamer
@Jerma985 why is this game on a wall
i think that's how you get more money
I mean, I'm glad to be a part of a society that has made no progress
You're not supposed to be in the middle of a fight
Jerma, I've been watching your stream since the day I was born
I'm just saying this is a mess
@Jerma985 you're gonna get a streamer license if you dont win
@Jerma985 make a tier list for the next stream
This is a great game, Jerma. You should do it.
just not the 2nd one that's just an xbox controller
@Jerma985 Put the phone in the bathtub
@Jerma985 The only thing you can do is make the water around the house a little cooler and put it in the bathtub
@Jerma985 You're gonna get the wrong answer LUL
@Jerma985 put the gas pedal on the first row
i hope this is a real time stream
@Jerma985 "I'm gonna eat a shoe" jermaSun
I'll never forget the time Jerma was in chat, he said "no"
@Jerma985
====================
The government has not even mentioned the new Star Wars trailer yet
@Jerma985 play a game of your own game
my guess is that the people who are going to be watching this stream are going to be the ones that don't know the game
jermaOld i wasnt born in the middle of the night
jermaPop I'm a JermaPop and I'm proud of you jermaHeart
jermaWalk PUT THESE GAMES OUT OF THEIR MISERY jermaWalk
Jerma's gonna make a video on this game and then he'll be late
The new Jerma game is so good that it's worth buying it
SourPls THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR MONEY
This is a very angry guy, I'm sorry
is this the streamer that killed his own dog?
I know this is a boring game but this is an extremely engaging one.
@Jerma985 You can hold R to clear the lava
@Jerma985 You can only get the weapon at the end of the level
@Jerma985 The next boss is a different kind of boss
The last one has a more annoying sound effect than the other one
@Jerma985 when you die you have to make a new one
You have to wait until you are at the end
jermaWalk the game is gonna be over in like 30 minutes
jermaWalk i would like to be a sub
you need to let go of the gun
It's the 2nd jerma stream in a row jermaVenus
i like how jerma is trying to figure out how to draw
I think you just don't want to get hit by the first guy
LUL I like how Jerma is trying to figure out how to draw the "WII"
This is the first time I've seen this stream
you have to put the thing under the table
JERMA YOU'RE IN A COMA, GO TO THE STATION
@Jerma985 its okay you're a good streamer, just dont beat this game
This game is so easy to make, you can't even make it in 3D
@Jerma985 It's like the "Jerma is the only streamer with a well-written essay due in 10 years" joke
Jerma you can't make me stay up all night to watch your streams
If you're a real gamer you have to do what you think is best
@Jerma985 You have to get in the middle of the track
@Jerma985 use your old farting skills to become the next Jerma
i think he was just gonna say "i don't have time"
Hey jerma, did you ever play a game that was just called "japanese"
You can't even tell if your dad is in there
the best part of the movie is the little kids showing up
You need to hit the bottom of the platform
@Jerma985 I just wanted to say that I love you man
i cant believe jerma is playing this game for the first time
@Jerma985 It was just a house flipper boss
i just watched the vod on youtube and it was really cool
@Jerma985 YOU WERE IN A MOTHERFUCKING PLACE YOU DAD
I thought the game was playing ads for like 5 seconds
guys stop counting the first letter of the alphabet
jermaOld jermaOld i dont get it, it's just a huge ass
The only thing that’s not bad is the fact that you have to restart the game
Jerma, when did you get a diaper? I'm concerned for your health
@Jerma985 this is the first time I've ever seen this stream
Can you imagine if you had a small kitchen in a high school
I'm just here to see the game, but I'm just here to see the reactions
@Jerma985 you need to get to the town
i can't wait for the end of this game
what if we kissed in the shower and we were in the shower
Jerma, do you know how to draw the "WII"
I just got back what the hell happened
@Jerma985 I think you need to be in the water
i love how this streamer is trying to make the water taste like garbage
oh my god this is so funny LUL
HES GONNA LOSE IT ALL THE TIME
I love how Jerma is trying to figure out how to draw the "WII"
@Jerma985 they had to make a new one to do this
jermaWalk YOU'RE GOING TO GET COLD jermaWalk
@Jerma985 You need to be able to tell when the zombie is the boss
i wouldnt be able to watch this stream without a t-pose
Jerma, do you know if you can get the DLC?
@
====================
PlasmaReaper @Jerma985 you have to take your time and not get bored
why are you wearing a diaper on the toilet
is it really that bad if you have a hard time catching up on the streams?
JERMA PLAYS A NEW GAME THAT I CAN'T WATCH
@Jerma985 You got to work, you didn't get to play this game.
I have a very high IQ, I'm so glad to see you succeed
jerma you are a "the internet" streamer, you should be banned from all streams
@Jerma985 get a new fucking car in the garage
I'm so proud of you Jerma, I can't wait to see what you do next
@Jerma985 You need to do this in the tutorial
@Jerma985 you have to do the "I'm never coming back" joke again
@Jerma985 You can't put a bounty on a dead body
I just got back from the bathroom and you're still doing the game?
I'm gonna be honest, I've never seen this game before
This is what it feels like to be a Jerma985
@Jerma985 you're gonna make a lot of money
@Jerma985 You need to go back to the first level, it's a secret level
He's going to have to do another dumb joke
I have to say I like the first part of this game
@Jerma985 How long did you have to do to get to the top
you have to read the entirety of the book, then ask a question
@Jerma985 What if you were to be a bot?
chat just wants to be friends and not be the weirdo
@Jerma985 what happened to your webcam? i thought you were doing it wrong
@Jerma985 You're playing a game that has no context
this is like a real life version of the game, only worse
Jerma you know you need to play on your own time
I think he said he was gonna do another vod.
@Jerma985 you have to do a really big red red sign, it's not a typo
this game is so boring. its almost as if it's been 5 hours
@Jerma985 You can do the "I'm never coming back" joke again.
@Jerma985 if you do it, you can do it
I wouldnt be surprised if you're a gamer
I'm gonna put the coffee in your mouth
i cant believe hes playing this game
@Jerma985 you're in the same spot that you were in last time
did you hear that they are being tortured
You can't have sex with a cow in the game
there's a second stream on the other day
@Jerma985 you need to get a soundboard of the music
this is just a true story of a guy who was born with a bald spot
that's why you have to make a bad joke
@Jerma985 i just got a new laptop for my work
@Jerma985 Theres a really good version of this game on Steam
@Jerma985 you have to go through the portal to the north
I like this game so much but its too easy for me
@Jerma985 jermaJup1 jermaJup2 are you a mod or a modded streamer?
@Jerma985 Please go to the end of the level
@Jerma985 hey guys, you just got a new job, can we get a sponsorship? :)
@Jerma985 is the other one your brother from the discord?
you're gonna lose your mind playing this game
@Jerma985 You can put a load of money in your pocket to pay for the lottery ticket.
@Jerma985 I have a feeling you've been following along.
you know you'd be a good streamer, right?
@Jerma985 I think the L I C A S
@Jerma985 can you explain the title and then tell us what happened
there's a pretty good game on steam called "The Thing"
If you kill the birds you get the food
If I were a rat I'd just be a clown
If you are a rat, you can't be a rat.
what the fuck is wrong with this dude
@Jerma985 Your stream is just getting more and more boring
@Jerma985 Have you ever thought about making a 5th wall?
@Jerma985 im sorry for making you play this
@Jerma985 you can make an actual snake just by selling it
Jerma you're gonna get the wrong taste in the microwave
@Jerma985 You can see the top of the screen
@Jerma985 you have to turn off the radio to get it
@Jerma985 Did you know that the second phase is a very small boss fight?
chat is just going to be
====================
WITH YOUR BOOTS YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
@Jerma985 I can't believe you're not a billionaire
I think he needs to wear a hat, not a wig
I'm not sure how to react to the "jerma is a robot"
@Jerma985 I think you need to put the slingshot on your face and then put it in the tank
@Jerma985 I'm watching you play the game, can you do the voice again?
why would you make a park in this game
@Jerma985 you should change the music so theres an echo effect
I'm going to go to sleep now. Have fun Jerma.
i have no idea what to do with myself
@Jerma985 you can do the same with a fart
You can't just get a fortnite villager and grow into a tall man
I just got here, what the hell is going on
@Jerma985 What do you think of your pants?
it's in a box on the floor underneath the closet
It's not like you can get away with it
@Jerma985 you should play the boss fight where you have to do this
the giant enemy spider is still coming
If you get enough people to make this a reality then I will donate $10,000 to you
this guy is a real gamer what a psycho
@Jerma985 How many people do you have to kill?
LUL it's the toilet bowl in the shower
@Jerma985 you don't need to be a boomer to understand the game
I'm so happy that you're here. <3 <3
Jerma is going to die and not eat the shoe
HE IS A HIDDEN GOD OF A GAMER
@Jerma985 you're going to get sued by Nintendo, sue Nintendo, sue Nintendo
If you're a little too dedicated to the game, you'll get sued by McDonald's
do you think they'd let you live with that?
@Jerma985 You can't play a game without knowing what it looks like
You know what is going to happen after you're done
JERMA YOU ARE IN THE PIPE FOR THE LAST TIME
@Jerma985 you should make a time machine so you can be more accurate
@Jerma985 why is this game so long?
@Jerma985 You need to put the slingshot on your face
@Jerma985 You're not going to die to Pinwheel.
HE'S GONNA BEAT YOU OUT OF MONEY
I think it's the electric chair, he's gonna be in the next one
Why is the chat so obsessed with this
oh my god he's gonna do this again
@Jerma985 Make the banana stick so that it's a stick
this is the worst game i have ever seen
@Jerma985 just wait for the drop in attack
@Jerma985 what's your opinion on the current state of the internet?
@Jerma985 You're gonna need to be a sub
@Jerma985 do you have a personality test
@Jerma985 you have to do it now to get the full experience
@Jerma985 have you seen the stream where you told the story of a munch
@Jerma985 there's a game called "tiger hitman" that is like a kids book
@Jerma985 is the new emote really just "Jerma"
@Jerma985 This is what happens when you get hit by a car
@Jerma985 YOU'RE IN A HOUSING DUE TO THE CREDIT CARD
@Jerma985 What's the name of the new character?
it's like the movie where the psycho kills a child
the game just wants you to kill yourself
it was a lot of the same shit
@Jerma985 I'm gonna say it again, you're a lot better than I am, you have the best camera
"You can't do this. You can't" -Jerma985
@Jerma985 get the one on the right side
its the guy that said he was gonna eat an apple
@Jerma985 you have to kill the woman
@Jerma985 I saw a picture of a fish in the trash
I thought that was a good idea, just can't really tell if it was made by the developers or the game
Jerma's not a good dad he has a bad time
@Jerma985 you need to play as the titanic
@Jerma985 you can't just buy a bug house
@Jerma985 its called the katana jackbox, you need to find it
@Jerma985 This is a very early 2000s anime
@Jerma985 You're gonna need to buy the flute
i have been gone for a few hours and i see you were gone for an hour
@Jerma
====================

I like this fucking fucking joke in my head
You don't have to know how to pick the top pick
I just want to know the last time they used this joke
i really want this to not be a bit of a fucking joke
I wanna know how it would go if your face was like 2 times your height
@Jerma985 I want to start a chat discussion on how Jerma can keep it with me :(
What the hell is wrong with you
@Jerma985 why did you bring on a clown car LUL
I swear this is my worst moment since eating a shoe
when will I eat all the food i eat
@Jerma985 they were too scared to make you drink the water
@Jerma985 You don't know what they're going to do with the kids
just tell the cow to get off your shoulders
why the fuck would a vroomer put these guys in the same cage??
it's actually nice to be honest with you
I just got the boots from the old man jermaPluto

jermaVenus Jerma, I heard there's a new character in "Hail Caesar!"
You have to leave and then the streamer will beat you then
he's got a problem with one of his streams, he's like a bad boy
@Jerma985 you can have him beat a level, this one seems like it'll be easy :)
the new one, its like 2 or more people are watching
im a twitch chat member now i havent heard of kenshi
If someone is dying in front of you just think for a second about it
I've been reading Jerma's comments since about last week
@Jerma985 you can do 2 hearts if you want to give people points
@Jerma985 It's just like the other way around, we'll see a fight after this one.
@Jerma985 when are you gonna get more of those?
this is the real life version of pinwheel
@Jerma985 you know this game is going to run like 500 hours and I will literally be watching you all be fucking dead in a matter of hours.
how will you pay to do all of these things
this is just a good game for the kids.
Jerma is gonna spend some money on a movie night
how can you make a "v" sound when you've never heard one
the last time i saw the stream was like an hour ago
can i stream for a while until he does it
the stream is starting at 2 AM so I can make jokes right when he gets back from the gym LUL
you get to see all the funko pops but you gotta go on your own
LUL he's a pro and he's gonna use that as a motivation
jerma is a man of no conscience
you have to show all the funko pops
He also knows that the game is rigged so he must play through it all
he doesn't know. what is a normal boomer
I wonder what it's like to be a boomer
JERMA YOURE PLAYING SOMETHING YOURE NOT A BOOMER
we got a big ol stream with a big ol man jermaDafoe jermaSour
yeah jerma will never learn how to play D&D!
I have no idea what chat is talking about. I'll send an e-mail
Jerma is a good boy but is that a good thing?
Jerma, I got timed out on this game yesterday
@Jerma985 you look like you've been infected with a virus.
I was watching a streamer take a drug and then die in a bus
@Jerma985 why not just give them the chance to learn
you can do it, don't you want to do it?
@Vynixa you can't eat the meat, you don't have a liver, the meat doesn't grow
the best way to win games is to not stream :)
i dont know how to read chat and i wish for my child to understand that
I'm just a little bit confused, what is this, a horror game?
J E R M A I N D
Why does the streamer have a bag of dirt? jermaPluto
this is the worst stream you've had
The same kind of fucking song jerma, what the fuck
we were the ones with the idea to just have one random game
jerma is just a boy at the gym with his friend
this music is so good, the music is fucking awful
jerma985 why isnt your shirt made of cotton for a shirt
I've got that weird bone I can't use any more, its getting to that level
this is like the game before the movies :)
I wish JUP did it, but I don't know.
I'm going to pee in a bathtub right now
this whole time I was at home
@Jerma985 You might need to turn it off to get enough speed
oh my god i thought this was about the gee!
im a little bit disappointed that some of this crap is not getting in yet
you have a lot of control over them, it's like a big jerma is always going in for some sort of a crisis
You were in a car crash that has been linked
this used to be a full game. i got stuck on the joke because jerma wanted more streams
Jerma you've been in the hospital for over two weeks
i wonder how many times we can save him
it's not bad at all it just hurts the first 5 minutes
Jerma just got an update from an older guy, he was saying that it was just a random noise, but it still makes me sad
what is ur username so weird and funny you're still not getting any attention NotLikeThis
this looks like like the kind of shit i would want to see on a stream LUL
JERMA THAT'S A HOPPING WII WOULD NOT HAVE BEED THIS GUY
jermaHeart my friend's dad got the whole family to donate blood monkaS
i dont think anyone makes fun of him
Why do you always sound like someone who’s born in the 70s/80s
@jerma985 i know i didn't see that jermaPluto
i would have given money for a good joke with that
@Kenshi2 I would have never watched a stream that didn't have a streamer playing it in it though
he said it but we are just saying you're not streaming LUL
I can't believe how fucked up he was FeelsBadMan
You could have done it, but it just wasn't the point
its not like his name is jerma, he's not jerma
@Jerma985 YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAD A TREE IN LADUCE
@Jerma985 just because a streamer doesn't work out doesn't mean that it's the end of the world
HEY THAT'S REALLY WHAT A POG STREAM LOOKING LIKE
i think it's just a case of the guy not finding someone
"i want him to stop im a man of my word!"
Jerma just do a single song with a single line, and you're good!
He was actually a real asshole before L4M3K
@piggygiggler you should play another game of mario maker it'll give you your personality and youll have a lot more fun
@Jerma985 you can get a couple times in the next game
You just don't know how to work the game
Jerma is too afraid to make a new emote
no one will die from it ever LUL
You dont have enough time to be bad.
@h00t me too lol, it took about an hour for jerma to beat it
is it a game I enjoy streaming? i would love to see you play it
i cant believe jerma died to a clown
you're a pretty cool boy boy I hope you are
if you die you die too jermaPluto
I will never see this game again jermaPluto jermaPluto
If I can make this in 20 years?
jerks is the only streamer with a chance
I'm only here to stream. I am a little older. Theres a man in front of me. What is he talking about?
@Jerma985 this is just the one guy in here
how does a boomer come to sleep at 5 AM, theyre talking about the internet
@jerma985 you should hire a real person to teach you what to do LUL
@jerma985 do a vod you can do it on YouTube
What the fuck? This game is all fake
jermaDafoe I'm sorry Jerma couldnt be found
Jerma have you considered getting an actual highschool graduation?
I swear this game has been around for a couple of hours. It sounds like you're trying to play some kind of video game
Jerma have you considered your upcoming college applications?
@Jerma985 this is not a song if you keep the music in the background OMEGALUL
It's too much work to just kill all the monsters
just give the guy in charge at the end
oh is this the game that killed darkwood
I just got here how are we still here
if someone makes a sound like this is a thing
JERMA IS THE BEST GUY. I JUST DO THAT
we've been on a roll lately, but we have a lot of progress in the past hour or two and the story is still so good
Is this what it feels like to be a streamer?
Why the hell are we going to a casino
jerma you are going to lose to the real jeremy
you sound like a guy that has been here all day
You'd be like a guy in highschool
he can't hear my messages because of his mic
@Jerma985 i'm eating the last of peanut butter
I can't see if the stream is off at all :(
he would be at the grocery store after playing this for so long
YOU FUCKIN SWEAR AND I'M BEGUNNING YOU jermaDafoe
i was the new streamer on april fools
I was hoping this was another dark souls episode
@jebeebee it is a video game it will be an old ad. jermaDafoe
we're trying hard to get on a flight we cant even do it
jermaPluto i can't believe that i live somewhere irl
can i get a sub for an emote
Jerma you are an idiot, you fucking idiot
@Jerma985 you have to eat the cake
jerma its a fucking joke you're the funniest person in the world
im in the gym watching the other person
@Jerma985 you should hire a real man to teach you what to do
Jerma was really late to this joke LUL
He needs to get more of that
if you go back there you can go back to the same location. you need to get to the top
if you dont take off your shirt then fuck off
i wanna sleep right now is the best word
It’s going to get really boring when jerma gets old
I have to get to Jerma to play with him
this game has so much bullshit like that LUL
Jerma are you a furry or something?
I like the fact that I got no news or a voice
jermaOld it's just a joke because your not playing the level
@Jerma985 you can beat that game if you give the boots to a dude.
The joke about being a Jerma fan is funny
they could have done better with that one
It's not that you can't, but they did
@Jerma985 You could also be a lot of small guys sometimes
@Jerma985 Just keep talking and do your best
if you're not a clown then i'm not a true fan lmao
I wonder if there's a thing you can add to the inventory
just throw money at a random spot
@Jerma985 it's in your inventory so it doesnt matter when you get money
LUL he's not even paying attention and hes so tired LUL
oh my gosh, this is actually a stream
@Jerma985 Are you using the toilet this stream?
it's like a 2nd grade teacher talking to 3 kids at once.
It's not like I'm in your time :)
@Jerma985 are you still using the mouse?
I have a feeling it's from the 2 years ago
oh jesus is someone doing that right now that makes me FEEL like I'm in a trance
i wish i had a real jerma985 to watch
@Jerma985 you cant talk about the stream please
@Jerma985 you know what you said? you've had it all together
jerma you are one of my favourite people
Why don't you just do an in-game voice
@Jerma985 This is a new stream, this one is not good for you I know this stream is not bad for you.
it works in 5 different languages, so you’re good
just don't play all the games at the exact same time :)
why are all these people doing this for free? Kappa
Why is he dressed like a doritos donald duck
why does the giant ape voice sound different?
@Jerma985 i have an ad but you can't watch it
i still love that you read that in this chat so i really appreciate it
it's not fun to just read it out loud
@Jerma985 just take one of the old man games
the first game in a row is really good
i love that you are here :) @jerma985
i thought you were in a vroomer?
@Jerma985 theres a tutorial on how to get over this
"I have a headache from being so tired. I try my best but it gets worse and worse and I can't do it."
the stream is getting late so I will be back for more LUL
Lmao this guy just doesn't know how to cook??
i dont do that but i do like 1-2
its cool he only gets the most fucked up shit
He's just gonna read out a lot jermaGrin
@Jerma985 is that what the car looks like LUL
i just have a feeling we have good memes to make
@Jerma985 you look like a man trapped in a cave with no life, you must have a mental breakdown
@barkat_ is that a reference to the game?
I didn't find a single song in this one.
theres so many great people out there who are in this chat for free PogChamp
so this is what you had in one second
how much did a gamer have to pay for a game like this?
You can run the game with like 60% of your body
@Jerma985 You have to hit the button to open the door
@Jerma985 I don't care what you do, I enjoy playing you like a fun streamer
@jerma985 you have one shot you just need to remember that you're doing the same job as the person that did it
What is that? Whats the big deal???
@CrimsonDread no, you would have to start the stream in the exact opposite order
@Jerma985 I just got back to the start of the stream
you should try a new sound pack :)
i never heard a vod at twitch meetup
Jerma just needs a bunch of money to keep his head above water so he can live at the bottom
I just finished the same game, what was the worst part?
yeah the game just sucks, you need to beat this
is that the sound of a guy dying at the end of a stream?
@Jerma985 you can get stuck on the last boss
youre not going to be able to save yourself if you don't do it right
@Jerma985 the "not a joke" in the intro isnt your problem
you can only run at 100% or something LUL
I thought you were in a vroomer?
@Jerma985 You're a Jerma985 fan but you have such good taste in games, please get the best out of this game and stream it all so chat gives you the best memories EVER
you are the one who gets to play with mary :)
You gotta have a good eye for this jermaOld
jermaHeart jerma please stream for me and for my family
the other guy has no power so he killed you
Jerma, how does the first part of this count as this?
jerma is having a hard time with this shit
What does it even mean? I don't know
jermaChomp Jerma's going so deep into the game that i cant see his ass
I know it was a bit far but the music worked out
i feel like you cant make a joke like this
you can do all types of shit with one weapon LUL
its a game where you must get your shit together
@jerma985 You need to play the DLC, you need to go through the tutorial level
@Jerma985 you might need to turn it off to see what the game is saying, it doesn't turn off your mic.
this game looks like the original Resident Evil
there's a clip of jerma reading this. it's so cute
"this one looks like a real game dude"
this sounds like you did it in a movie?
How many of you see this guy in the street
jermaDisgust jermaJex2 @Jerma985 JEX IS NOT SURE jermaJex2
i love how the game is too fast i can still make your funny face and i cant make myself smile
I was supposed to post the clip yesterday, you guys are ruining it LUL
i wish I had as much money as you guys
imagine not using a twitch emote, someone is streaming the stream right now jermaDafoe
@Jerma985 You look like a joker in a hit&run
@jerma985 are the two in the center corner? LUL
The only way to save the world is for him to die.
I'm gonna go check it out please jerma :)
why does it sound like a zombie in the game
This is just a "Jerma's gonna leave the world" scenario.
LUL a lot of shit in this game
It's my turn to kill you too!
I thought that was a picture of Kim LUL
I was like "this guy is a dick"
hey man i didn't wanna shit my pants :(
@Jerma985 Are you going on a date with Vinny?
I hope no one dies to pinwheel next jermaPluto
@Jerma985 Please just get the other guy out. I need to see the stream
this one isn't very hard but the hardest is the first level
i love you jerma, i would love you more if you did a video series with us jermaHeart
jermaWalk jermaJex2 when jermaTV is the end of the world meme PogChamp
Can we put jermaTV on the Jerma subreddit
Is there more? I've got an answer now
the only game I was looking forward to was Sekiro
@Tingy im glad we were doing it, as a joke or a reference
this reminds me of the time you used to eat a taco shell
jerma has a bunch of fucking eyes this stream
is he playing as a frog, just not as a real frog?
i want to get mad jerma, but no. we didnt say the n word about it, we said n word again, maybe it'll be something
i don't like the fact you have to start from the start
@kimdang @Punkledinks I didn't think it was happening. I think Jerma has been ignoring it for most of the day
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD BE THE SAVELONE
what is the point of this game
oh no, hes in jail for a LOSER
You dont get the message or the wink lol
jerma I got a call and you didn't even have the game yet jermaVenus
can't wait for the streamer to talk about it, thanks a ton jermaHeart
the first character is the one jerma is a bit too serious
He's doing his own voice, what's he gonna make for his stream
If it's not a Jerma stream I won't post it on the main channel either. My personal life is fine :) .
I’m getting a headache, will I be back in an hour or so @Jerma985
You look like Jeremy, Jeremy, and Jeremy!
@Jerma985 How is it that you got banned
@Jerma985 Can we get a live stream for when someone's playing a game? @Jerma985
oh they all went to the other house
i want an open mic jermaVenus PogChamp JermaVenus
jerma should i watch nancy drew? ill show vinny when you post a clip
why is he getting paid to beat the first boss without having to do it
i really wanted to vote for dave :)
You can tell how far they took you
he doesn’t know how to use the sword jermaPluto
this dude beat out a whole town by the end of this @jerma985
this game isnt even out yet LUL
@Jerma985 you just got banned from twitch for a few hours. don't worry jerma
jermaPluto just use an ipad emote to make chat happy
He's playing this on PC and not in real life
you're going to be the next one to become a doctor :)
he's not a real gamer jermaOld jermaOld
YOU DUMB STREAMER DIES TO KIRBY HE CURRENTLY HATES CHATTING
You've had to play the game again, you've got some stupid issues.
@Jerma985 you can only be the last person to go
@Jerma985 This is the only one in the game Jerma and Joel are playing at the same time
why is that a funny meme in my head
they're already having to do it to save them LUL
@AxePose you're not meant to use guns, you just need to get them from the ground
@Jerma985 this is the only game he is streaming today
oh shit its the same game when its done
Jerma you're the only person I have ever had a relationship with that has an unending stream, and I fucking love it, and I love streaming whenever it does
@Jerma985 can you show us this stream it's a great trick
I need to get my dad a burger
jerma i think you'll be okay jermaHeart jermaHeart
hey did you do a "jermaWalk" that took 5 minutes to execute
yeah not many people watch games with mods so im glad your here
i feel like we still need to do stuff like clean toilets, but at the same time we already need to learn as much as possible
You think Jerma would be too dumb to be a god? LUL
we should all donate to that one streamer who beat Darkwood
I have seen the same thing happen during a livestream
hehe jerma why are u streaming so long
I like how this game only looks like one guy
hey chat is this the streamer who lost to pinwheel?
this is more like a prerecorded clip of them talking
I just like the concept of being able to play it now
I hate to break in here sometimes but how is it that I can leave this level now ?
I just tried this one but I really wanna try it too :(
@Jerma985 if you had 1 million years old bodies
It does a lot of stuff for your back
@Jerma985 i'll send you a picture of one of your assholes tbh LUL
@Jerma985 do a quick "wow wow thats a really good idea, why didn't you change it?"
He needs to start to eat at 5
i love u guys and ill be back in a bit
i have a few hundred channel points jermaTV jermaHeart i feel so good
i can relate but it really does feel like a new game for him
@jerma985 you just got a job that allows you to watch old videos.
@Jerma985 I hope you feel better when you read the rest of this
You're in the first episode of that series
This is how we get rid of the Vinesauce meme PepeHands
oh i thought there were like, two people doing this
@Jerma985 you can go into the secret room in that room.
jerma, your stream seems to be slowing down, it's okay jermaPluto
if not we can never do it again jermaIQ
What the fuck did Jerma do for a minute
He needs to put on a shirt jermaVenus
he's making a good joke today, but they don't make a good joke the next week
we are gonna get him banned for his birthday today
@Jerma985 Can you stop using the sword Jerma? jermaMerc
he'll get into an argument with chat if you start giving him 5 more jumps or he'll fucking kill everyone for good
just play it in a new browser game
I'd be in favor of a game called Mario Sunshine but it wouldn't make sense
That's probably a lot of money to have had a life of your own
i feel like i'm at the center of a huge problem, something I'm trying to get rid of
i left for 2 hours and you are still doing this shit
jerma's been doing a good job this week?
the only good thing about being in a club though is that you're always drunk, but its still the same guys
@Jerma985 YOU CAN'T GET A WOOD ON THE BLOCK
You have to pick a good time for dinner :)
LUL He still got to the beginning of the game tho
jermaWalk WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK, IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS
I can't wait to see jermba's feet in his hands
i wish i had jermaOtto on my wishlist
I really don't get the feel of the sound LUL
This is a really good game, and we will still have a Jerma 2 stream
@Jerma985 I have a job now, I can pay out my college debt jermaPluto
jermaJup1 jermaJup2 do it now jermaJup3 jermaJup4 jermaJup3 jermaJup4
I love the feeling that everyone is just cheering
this is an emote but not a message? Kappa
You only get to play this if you play Nancy Drew 2 @Jerma985
it's a game about the man and his obsession with his penis
if he died the game would crash :(
did you play the original pokemon game? @LeoMacleod
@Jerma985 You have more channel points than people at the table
If Jerma were ever late you wouldn't have to watch
jerma can you start the stream i need my jerma sub
@Jerma985 I dont know what the actual fuck is a thing with the sound effect
You are the only one that can really get away from it
Jerma if you go live soon i will give you all my stuff
@Jerma985 can you move on to the next game please?
jermaOtto hey guys i got a new laptop
What if he's streaming for 5 hours while he's peeing?? LUL
jerma i'll see u at the airport once i get back
im actually here for 4 hours wtf
@Jerma985 You should check out the "dying to super mario" video
just dont go out of the way and shoot them, shoot only the enemy.
i did one of those on my last game stream
This game is just giving me anxiety
so you need a real car? the new car
jermaSun HE'S TAKING IT ALL, GO CRAZY, JUST GO
@jerma985 Can you just eat something like chocolate milk?
I'm still waiting for Jerma to win PogChamp
jermaVenus we can only watch this if the stream is late
I wonder if a man could make a Jerma985 voice
it doesnt work for me like that
that's why i thought he was still playing that one
is the carnival stream gonna be in the next 3 days???
it's not even a good game, this is just jerma doing a shitty commentary
jermaOld I love how fast he takes this easy joke
You have to make them to fight and shoot
@Jerma985 you know how much money you're giving me? $10
jerma we are all in this together
theres a lot of people who have to say things that I've never even said
@Jerma985 if you werent an asshole then why do you still stream this game you know I'm a fuckin moron and I'm sorry
what if this is the stream and a video game
@Jerma985 I'm gonna leave for the next few hours. :)
they have some cool shit you know this.
Jerma you must have gotten the best part of the tutorial :)
oh wow, jerma really does look like IRL
why can't i get my sub back, it's been a week :)
It's that time in the middle of the night where there's a whole lot of screaming and shit
he's got a bad reputation for doing that LUL
i have one of those alligator wings
when theres a vod youre going to eat them
why is this guy so bad at jump king
jermaPluto he can't do any of this unless his dad is mad at him
Why is there a full headless zombie just standing in front of his computer monitor monkaS
why arent you doing it again this time?
can you mute the streamer please! i'm trying to make it sound better for you
i am so excited and scared for you
Jerma and Joel should just make an animated movie
its like the next game you're playing
jermaHeart I'm a streamer myself! I support you Jerma!
chat is the funniest thing I've ever experienced in my life
i dont think i have been playing this in the time i was 14
the music is really quiet its like he is playing a game
i had a dream I had a nice old lady that was my mom
You don't need a VPN when you can just use a VPN in your area
JERMA YOU'RE IN THE TUBE MOUNTAIN, BE LIKE
That guy is such a dick jerma. I would get that fucked up
@Jerma985 it was like 20, theres a giant rat with a penis in it
This has been a really good stream for you
is this the new jerma video game on stream
I was born in 1939 so that would be funny
JERMA YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE RAT MUSIC monkaS
i thought its your fault but that makes me proud to be alive
JERMA PLAY SOMA AND NOT SOMA AGAIN
no this wasnt an accident its a normal job
this is more disturbing than the one from the gamecube version
You cant hear them if you dont see them @Jerma985
@Jerma985 you will lose money if you play more VR
What would you do Jermas fans if your job was to take care of us.
I remember this bit from the new years
this isn't a porn game, this is a children's game jermaPluto
jermaOld You didn't eat those beans? You have to eat them
"My body got too much power and it didn't even hit me. I'm on an early list. Can you eat them?"
i just remember it this past winter jerma is starting to feel a bit old?
Is jerma using a PS4 instead of the Xbox? jermaPluto
oh shit, youre so bad at video games now
i don\t even remember the time jerma was live LUL
he doesnt even know he exists jermaPluto
@Jerma985 can you move it so it moves faster?
I was wondering why the game didnt let you buy a new mouse with a key combo and it took so long, I'm not surprised
This guy sounds like a dude who only drinks coffee
I'd like to see a stream of jerma screaming at chat about how it sucks but i don't.
that's the sound of a monkey shitting his pants
i just got here what the fuck is he doing
if you play that game its worth 100 dollars
@Jerma985 youre a good one to have in your own home :)
@Tristen985 If you like the song of that game its on the NES jermaHeart
You do it to make sure you win, this one seems like good music
oh god i think this isnt a normal stream
this is the best music I have ever seen LUL
@jerma985 its ok chat is trying to warn you
Just do the other parts so it works better
The same people from last time jermaPluto
Just use them as an energy source, you gotta pay off your own debt
you have to hit the side of the bed
what if they just ate that baby before the movie? @Jerma985
i cant believe jerma is using a keyboard
i want to know why he can't find kim's porn page
@Jerma985 when you hit the ring, you can make it turn into a water bottle
You just look like the boss of every single one of these
I don't know what that game is, I thought you'd play it now
@Jerma985 You can buy your own custom pawns if you want
Hey Jerma, how'd you like to stream
@Jerma985 I thought you were at level 3 and a while ago
@Jerma985 you should play viscera cleanup detail after you beat vargTodd
I just saw the Jermacraft youtube video where there was a video of you playing a kids game and it was really funny
@Jerma985 why doesnt it just have a facecam that was on in the back of the game?
@Jerma985 I think it's that you don't have the stomach for the meat
Jerma please don't go live so we get to hear you tell your story
@Jerma985 please don't forget the fact that you are not a good sportswriter at times
If you want more action for your money it really was a good idea
he doesnt even know who he's attacking PepeHands
@Jerma985 There is a little map if you are looking through other players' maps
He does know you can't do the left on a bridge?
I'm gonna head to bed then jermaPluto
i can't believe jerma is streaming at the height of his power
You cant get a good deal with all of that stuff.
i like that he does it as a joke
Jerma has a very unusual skill set
he's gonna have more fun when you get to it
JERMA JUST HIT THEM WITH ONE OF THE BUCKS
is the jolly gookman coming back? I cant wait for the stream
You don't need to be there for this bit too. It's the one, just don't worry about the other 2
the sun is on the other side of the screen
i want to buy a 5 pack of cereal
@Jerma985 please stop i got to go to bed
is it true that you drank the entire bottle of coke
@Jerma985 there's a picture of the new one in the game you did LUL
you should have done another run you can keep it up with this
@Jerma985 you're so dedicated to this game, you have one of the best audio streams of this decade
YOU NEED TO MAKE A CITIZENS, THE MOUSE MOUSE @Jerma985
"oh well, im gonna go to bed"
is in the middle of every stream jermaOtto
This is pretty much what they told us
Jerma has never played the entire series before, he didn't finish the original game on time
this one feels like it was made in Dreams
You guys have some issues Jerma, you've been a constant streamer for the past 5 years
it was all about the bad guys
@Jerma985 the same game with the big red box on both sides looks pretty fuckin scary
you have to finish it then do it first
this game is so cool im gonna leave jermaPluto
It's the same as having a gun but with a zombie
I actually got sick just after he announced the stream :)
@Jerma985 The first thing you do is try to sneak out the portal
I mean I did when you left for the last fight LUL
how dare you. I hate you jerma
this game is actually getting me in trouble
you would have to just give it to the king
JERMA YOU CANT PICK UP ANYMORE MOUKS LUL
i mean the last one was probably like 3 years ago
that's some serious bullshit you've been streaming over
@Jerma985 How many times have you told this to happen?
oh god i cant believe it's jerma's birthday today
@Jerma985 you can only get it when the water is full
he doesnt have time for the rest of the stream
can't believe there is a full moon on the way back
JIMMY, I love you, I don't mean to be mean :)
you just have to let him use his full power
you were gonna end it but you didnt
i dont think you did it on purpose to be a weirdo
how could jerma even do this without making more than 5 levels of a game?? LUL
I want jerma to do the last part now that u gave up on it!
jerma, can you stop talking like this stream is over
@Jerma985 you can hold it right click on it to play all the games in the menu
@Jerma985 the game gives up if you die
He doesn't wanna lose the stream to someone who does the "who cares" thing
@jerma985 Can you play the game again if you want?
i wasnt subbed but this chat is the most spammed site I've ever come across :)
jerma, is there something wrong with you, or do you like anime more.
JERMA CAN YOU BEAT THE GAME HE SAID NEXT?
This is how you do the same as a vinewrestle copypasta @Jerma985
He doesnt know how to play? Well, theres no way at all
He's gonna have a fucking seizure on the stream
Jerma is going to get mad over the video of him crying for like 4 hours
That was the last song he'd played before
how many times is he gonna make a jerma joke again
oh my god i miss the end of the game
I'm really surprised this guy is still playing this game
This is why he doesn't have a computer
he didn't even make a tier list LUL
it's a meme, not a jock, you did this
i have a feeling this level wasnt meant as a boss fight lol
jerma you need a fucking new gamer's guide
LITERALLY GETS YOUR EMAIL IN THERE @Jerma985
is the stream just gonna take 1/100 of it's points, I don't know.
I mean, a lot of games like that suck.
He's not going to read my message because of your height
@Jerma985 YOU DIDNT
you can actually put it down without jumping
This is the most important part of the movie
I can literally swear this whole game is the "Worst Stream Of The Year"
i heard they are not going to start with the new years stream
@Jerma985 you have to tell them the story
Is this the guy who made a video in 2014?
this reminds me of that one game where you could buy superman armor, and it was not worth it at least
what is that sound you just made in a hallway right now
@Jerma985 I THINK YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND THE MONEY
You’ve made too much money to be worth it back to your home planet you fucking poooon
Jerma you just spent the whole year making up for it.
you should've been the one in the first place
i'm not even sure who did but i like it as a meme
i think it's because chat is being a dick
I guess this is what his "best" streams are about
This isn't a video game, it's a scary cartoon
@Jerma985 How many times can you say that? jermaSun
@Jerma985 you can make it work with a keyboard or mouse
@jerma985 you can turn down the volume, it reduces the size
this is why you should watch you play this
The first game on this is pretty good. But the sequel is just... bad.
this looks like he's going to run a marathon and win
@Jerma985 There's some shit going on in your room, and I’m worried
he's gonna come back at a later date if your doing this
@Jerma985 If you're not on the main menu, do the other quests/scrimbles/etc
@Jerma985 I'm playing Dead Rising 2 right now
jerma we dont really believe you, youre a dickhead
@Jerma985 hey I just made a vid for a game, I see you got through a lot with your level :)
You can get one of the more difficult versions
@Jerma985 why do your legs look like that?
@jerma985 do you have any plans to play more of halo 2
@jerma985 if you lose for 2 more tries, you've done it now Kappa
Jerma has taken the whole life of my city
This stream hasn't been going down in as many people's minds as I'm willing to admit. The first episode on the show was so good, but the second and third episodes suck as hell. I hope Jerma doesn't mind me talking about it now that the writing is off.
if he reads it it means something special
jerma you never play a game you enjoy
@Jerma985 this is the part where you die
this chat is like the Dark Souls of video games
You are the real Jerma, and youre right
that's a good one, i'd imagine you did this a lot back then
Dont get me started on jermaOneguy he better be good at something first!!
it's not even my age I'm just 23 :(
It sounds like your mom just saying "thank you"
is he actually a man or a woman?
You're gonna have your eyes closed like that now, I guess
@Jerma985 theres one on the edge in his house
jermaOld how could you not get that at least once a week?
@Jerma985 you can press alt to skip ahead
@Broluck this is the exact reason I love it
i wish all this chat shit was in a small chat room
this game is really good, what could go wrong
@jerma985 how much do you pay to come back?
i had it so i couldnt sleep jermaPluto
@GudgementJold you think jerma would still say "no no" if he saw the first thing people say?
@jerma985 do not give your money to the president
Jerma, you should be playing this in the end
@Jerma985 you have to pick up some stones, keep going
jerma you are so much better at this shit
is it a joke that i should not stream?
@Jerma985 You can use the power of the wii for extra attack. You could just have a controller, not a button.
Why did you keep playing this shitty game?
I'm pretty sure that will be a huge deal in the next jermacraft
He doesn't know how to get in Kappa
